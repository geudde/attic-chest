## Book IX

## The Embassy of Adel


Вut Richard ceas'd not from the work of death,<br>
Sheath'd not his ssvord, nor gave his charger breath, Till not one turban'd svarrior stood to rear The useless sabre or presumptuous spear. Then on the turf his painful helm he thresv, In Arsouf's torrent cleansed his sanguine hue, And, svith uplifted hands and ardent gaze, To Heaven he gives the glory and the praise. Sad thoughts succeed ; the blood that stains his svreath ; The grief, that conquest must be bought with death ! в 2
иооь ix For Perc\ 's blighted youth he nou deplored, D'Oyíej the bra\e, and Ferrars' \etí>nm lord ; But ])шч, луЬеге pale the great 1)'Α\ιμιο·> «as laid, Ηί> manlv sorrows mourn'd th' illustrious dead. He bills w hajte'er oí funeral pomp may give Fame to the past, or solace those that uve, In ArsouFs walls the honour'd corse await— ( \rsouf, where ruled his valiant «ires «o late).* New grief succeeds ; Matilda's loss he hears f Now wrath inspire^, and now fraternal fear«.— 20 Now would he follow through the night, and claim, By force and threat'ning arms, the ravish'd dame. Now reason rules ; his calmer feelings rest On Adeľs pledge, and Raymond's rage represt. " Nay, seek not useless death, my friend ,· distrust Provokes deceit, and makes the falsehood just. Arabs have faith, and Adeľs worth is known In deeds not prais'd by Moslem lips alone. But if the dawn a broken compact shew, Thou shalt not find a brother's vengeance slow."—· 30
Meanwhile the Christian!», resting from iheir toil, Spread through the desert camp, and share its spoil. Night closes round, but frequent ssatcbfires gleam On Arsouf's tented slope and mountain stream ; And ruddy torches glanced along the plain, Where hasty tombs received the nobler slain, Where friendship svaked, the last sad rites to pay, Or the rude plunderer s.tripp’d his lifeless prey ; And flash'd, svhile frighted svolses at dtetan.ee bay'd, On du>ky hills and Sharon's magic shade. 40 The morning dasvn'd, but ere its earliest light Had Raymond climb'd to Arsouf s giddiesL height. While yet the mist forbade an eagle's keu To rest on plain, or stream, or shadosvy glen. Around, the clouds engage in fearful clash, And forked lighťnings glance, and thunders crash. Terrific thunder, heard by those alone Who lii-t the giant on his mountain throne ! Then sunk the storm, and many a verdant brosv Shone, like blest islands on a lake of snosv ; 50 Broad rose the rayless sun, and widely spread The skies svith gold, the billosvy mist svith red.— But lo ! those mists have melted in his beam, Or lingering only near each mountain stream, в 3
In fleecy wreaths, like clouds of summer bkies, Hang o'er the winding waters whence they rise. Far off, emerging from a woody glen, Now seen, now veil'd by bills or groves agen, A moving line appears, and flashing light Glows, as from helms or spears, on Raymond's sight. Now borne upon tbc breeze a gentle sound, Like strains of elfin harpers, breathes around ; A crag obstructs his gaze, but on his ear Λ The welcome music swells, till full and clear > The royal drum proclaims a Monarch near. y Now from the hill to view distinct advance Warriors with glittering helm, and shield and lance ; Standards whose black and tawny volumes roll'd O'er turbans, rich with purple, green, and gold ; Eunuchs, whose robes of spotless muslin flew, 70 In wayward contrast to their Nubian hue ; And Mamlukes, leading by the gilded rein Arabi η steeds, that scarcely touch the plain ; And fair-form'd slaves, whose veils of dazzling white, Imperial presents screen'd from vulgar sight. Next Adel rode, conspicuous o'er the rest By the white waving of his triple crest.
Behind, tvs'O chosen youths of Georgian race Led on a camel, train'd to gentlest pace, The roseate folds of whose rich palanquin 80 From curious eyes some rovai beauty screen. iio more th' enraptured Raymond paus'd to view, On wings of lose from Arsouf's cliff he flcss T , And breathless reach'd the distant camp, as staid At Richard's tent the gorgeous cavalcade ; As on its knees the svell-taught camel bends, And glad Matilda from her seat descends. Tbe courteous Adel guides her trembling frame, And to her brother yields the royal dame ; While his fair Queen, her peer in youthful charms,90 Folds her loved si.ster in rejoicing arms. To Adel then a thousand thanks svere pour'd, And ready menials spread the festive board. In each bright eye confiding pleasure sate, And concord smootb'd the svrinkled front of hate. But svhen his Mamlukes spread to Richard's s iesv The Soldan's gifts, the sister-Queens withdrew ; And Raymond too retired, to ease a breast, With rapture nosv, as erst svith grief opprest. в 4
Rich vests of honour, gems that knesv no price, 100 And bosvls enchased with many a rare device ; Hot Saba's spicy wealth, and Yemen's gums, Whose fragrant fume from silver censers comes : Conserves, till now to Western taste unknown, And fruits, the produce of a warmer zone ; l ' Sabres, whose blades delicious odours breathe, And amulets, that warn of guile or death. All these display'd, the slaves «tood meekly round, With folded arms and eyes that soug'it the ground, When Adel spoke : " I do not wait to hear 110 Repeated thanks that sicken on my ear, But I, myself no common herald, bring The proffer'd friendship of no common King. " Thus then of Ayoub's blood, of Joseph's line, Shield of the Faith, speaks mighty Saladine— His days may Alia guard, his power increase, Till earth be changed for Heaven's eternal peace ! e< When baffled hunters quit the idle chace, When distanced runners feign to yield the race, Fearpromptg,orshame; and some might deem that fear Brings me for peace a vanquislľd suppliant here :
Yet think what hosts shall anu at my command From Cashmere's vales, from Nubia's sultry sand ; From Egypt, where within his giant tomb The Patriarch sleeps from whom my fathers come ;* To mighty Kaf, on whose untrodden brow The Bird of Ages dwells in endless snow, Where Sultans ruled ere Adam's race began, Where Angels bow'd, and Eblis scoff'd at man. c All these, and more, beneath my favour shine, 130 Л And blend in prayer their Caliph's name with mine ! Then say if fear can dwell with Saladine ? To one less great could Joseph's heir descend, Or seek one less than Richard as a friend ? " Perchance as numerous tribes thy rule obey, And realms as various bless thy Western sway, That other seasons, other stars adorn, And fade in night when ours salute the morn : Yet what of wealth shall mightiest conqueror save, But the cold sheet that winds him in the grave ? d 140
While one poor peasant from 1иь hamlet driven, Has power to blast him ou the bridge of Heaven.* A few short years, perforce our strife m .bt cease, Our sons may fight, but we shall sleep in peace». Cc Behold me then, for either chance prepared, For peace or war, as now thy lips award ; Say why, innumerous as the crested waves, Your annual fleet the wondering Ocean braves ? What rancour fires to quit your tranquil reign ? What shun ye there, what here attempt to gain ?" 150 i( Twice fifty snows are gone since Godfrey bore," Thus Richard spoke, " the Cross on Syria's shore, And asks your Monarch now, why all most dear, Friends, kindred, home, we leave to perish here 5 — The land from hence to Jordan's sacred tide, The precious Cross where meek Messiah died, His tomb, and where Jehovah's temple stood— These have we vow'd to purchase with our blood." i( And these," said Adel, (i while these climes retain Their faith, their Prophet, must thou never gain. 160
That senseless wood ye prize—it once was ours j But, if by Genii curst, or Angel powers, Rapt from our view, 'tis ours to yield no more, Might we that scandal to our creed restore. 6 Nor can we to rebellious hands resign The sacred City (and it ne'er was thine), Salem, nor last nor meanest of the seven That Islam honours by command of Heaven ; For there the faithful Genii meet, and there Rose the great Prophet through ambrosial air, I7O What time, yet clothed in mortal flesh, he trod The sevenfold heavens, and view'd the living God. But if thou wilt, this contest yet shall cease, And Strife's crude apple yield the seeds of peace, " As late thy sister to the Soldan's breast Recalľd a form in halcyon youth imprest, When Eleanora with her former lord* In Antioch dwelt, by Turk and Frank adored, He wept to think how he with deadly strife Pursued her son—that late he sought thy life ; 180 But I with less paternal eyes beheld Matilda's charms, and rued my pledge to yield.
" Hear then, great King! and if your martial vow ~\ And jealous faith such bridal rites allow, \> Beneath our blended sway shall Syria bow ; j in all that splendour shall Matilda live That Egypt's wealth to Judah's throne can give. Free as in Christian lands, her gates of gold To ail she lists shall unreproved unfold ; While in my îealms, unquestioned as in thine, 190 Shall Christians pass to every sacred shrine ; My slaves obedient shall protect their faith, And aid them dying, and entomb in death. i( Then ponder well, a hostile realm to gain, By arms to win it, and by arms maintain, Or bid at once the strife of ages cease, And all the ends of war acquire by peace." " Vast is the stake, nor lightly to decide Becomes my youth ;" the English King replied. " True, I have kingdoms, fruitful realms and fair, 200 That now, perchance, demand a Sovereign's caie : Unmatch'd in arts and arms, a fertile isle, Whose vaici are green in Summer's temperate smile; Where nor hot winds nor fierce tornadoes blow, Nor Winter bring* unmitigated snow ,
While half those regions Philip calls his osvn, In corn and vines are clothed for me alone : Yet may I not desert a promise gis r en, Or quit for earthly cares the Cause of Heaven. Salem has yet a King,—a King my friend, 210 Can I crush rights I pledg'd me to defend ? Or should nor Heaven nor Lusignan svithstand, Without her sanction plight Matilda's hand?— I call my council,—thou meansvhile may'st bear My courteous greetings to the Soldan's ear ; Whate'er of friendship svar like ours can knosv, Christian and Infidel, or foe and foe.— Suy, should we close our contest or reness', If e'er again шу native land I view, Not his own bards in svarmer phrase than mine 220 Shall sing the posver, the svorth of Saladine." Soon to his Peers convoked, the Monarch shesv'd The proffer'd terms of peace, and then pursued : c ' Thus speaks the Soldan —and I yield the choice Of truce or conflict to the general voice. Think, if such terms our faith svith Heaven fulfil ? To leave the Turk on Sion's Holy Hill ; To yield a Christian Princess, and to prize As friends and kindred those our God denies ?
Ye miiiisters of Heaven ! its -svill explain ; 230 Thou, Lusignan ! thy menaced rights maintain ; Be every claim in equal balance tried, Weigh Λνβΐΐ, oh Princes ! лveigh them, and decide." He spoke, and wondrous, not a breath svas heard, Nor whispered murmur, nor dissentient svord. It.seem'd as some Lethean spell had crept Round each fierce heart —that even discord slept: Till, like the last faint sigh when tempests cease, One sound they uttered, and that sound svas " Peace !" The Asian prelates, Acre, Nazareth, Tyre, 240 And peers of France, that France and home desire, Wearied of war, and conscious that the shame Or praise alike svill cling to Richard's name, Each in his turn the offered rites allows, And brings meet instance of resembling vosvb. How oft Amalric leagued in strict accord With great Noureddin, and Iconium's Lord ; Nor fear'd in Egypt Chaver's cause to join, Even in his youth, the foe of Saladine/ i( Ha!" Raymond thought, " no martial voice, not one ! Discord and valour both with Conrad gone ! But Lusignan arises,—heavenly posver ! Thy priests arc faithless in this fatal hour,
Make then the claims of pride and interest strong— Matilda's fate is trembling on his tongue." Yes, Lusignan arose, and ne'er before So sweet a grace bis calm, fair visage wore. From his bright hair Judea's crosvn he took, And viesv'd awhile svith mild and pensive look. " Beloved in life, and honour'd in the grave, 260 To me this svreath Amalric's daughter gave ; Pledge of her truth, affection's sweet reward, I hail'd the glittering sveight, and vosv'd to guard. Yet fesv like me, the sport of fate, have found What thorns are hidden in its golden round; That this svide earth contains no wretched thing Despised, insulted, like a throneless King ! Not by ambition, but by duty driven, I prized svhat seem'd the sacred gift of Heaven ; Nor grief, nor chains, nor Conrad's threats unjust, 2/0 Could make my faithful soul desert its trust;—■ But nosv if heaven resume it, I resign— Heroic Richard, be its glories thine ! Guard if thou wilt, or svhere thou svilt bestosv, No jealous pangs this grateful heart shall knosv;— May he ss'ho svears, his realm in triumph free, Like me be faithful, but more blest than me.
Some tranquil small domain, alone 1 crave; A place of rest, an uncontested grave."— " Enough, my friend—till Heavens decree be knosvn, 280 In trust I take the delegated crosvn; Not for myself—my osvn paternal land Is amply s r ast to fill one sceptred hand. Yet must not thou, svho «¡asv'st the mightiest bend Beneath thy rule, from kingly rank descend. My recent prize, beyond description fair, Deserves a Monarch's undivided care; One half the Templars hold, the rest be thine its wealth, its regal honours I resign."^— Ç( Too generous King !" glad Lusignan replies, 290 " Not the wide earth could yield so dear a prize. Hail, Cyprus î fairest isle beneath the sun, So freely yielded, as so nobly won."— The Monarch smiled, when Raymond, struggling long, For looks less troubled and less faltering tongue, Abruptly spoke :— i( Is all our virtue gone > " Plead I for heaven's, for glory's rights alone ?— Is war so irksome nosv, that in the field, The hour of conquest, ye those conquests yield !
Acre, that three long years your arms svithstood, 300 Acre, whose stones are red svith kindred blood; Acre upbraids ye ss'ith each sacred stain, Arsouf implores ye by her glorious plain. All they adjure—but thee svith holiest posver, By the warm pride of victory's purple hour, Oh î Cœur de Lion ! theirs, thy fame to save, And shield from grief the spirits of the brave. Soul of D'Avesnes ! alas ! I deem'd thee blest, That in the grave thy senseless ashes rest, But thou shalt grieve in heaven—the injured slain 310 Shall nightly shriek round each polluted plain ; Till Islam's frighted slaves the region shun, And yield again the realm their valour won. Oh ! if in vain a Saviour's tomb implore, Does Honour, does Ambition fire no more ? And Richard— late I sasv thy manly brosv Pale svith fraternal fears,—^and canst thou nosv For ever yield her—yield her spotless soul To barbarous hands, to Infidel control— Force to a spouse abhorr'd her struggling svill?"— 320 " And can'st thou, Raymond, judge thy friend so ill ? Now, by this Cross, I svould not yield a rood Of all these regions, purchased with our blood ; vol. π . с
Or give Matilda to a yoke abhorr'd, To reign svide Asia's uncontested Lord. Call forth Sicilia's Queen." In steady tone He made the terms ot' proffer'd treaty knosvn. ŕí Think not," he added then in soften'd voice, " I give the name without the posver of choice. Think not, though all a Monarch's cares I feel, 330 My power more precious than my sister's weal. Adel is generous, has a princely soul, But his fierce passions never felt control ; Splendour svould wait thee on Judea's throne, But thine is not a heart for pomp alone. This hour assembled Princes svait thy voice, And peace or war may hang upon thy choice : But should they all ssith armed hosts demand, I svould not yield him thy reluctant hand ; Circled by those of alien faith alone, 340 Frightful to view,—speech, manners all unknown ; Perchance without a friend thy heart to share, Matilda! think, could'st thou be happy there?"— While thus he spoke, a bright but quivering streak Oft flush'd and faded on Matilda's cheek ; At length it died, yet still her eye was bright, Bright with a loftier and diviner light ;
Her air serene contrasting with the glow Of troubled passions all around her shew, With the deep terrors Raymond's looks express, 350 She bow'd her head, and meekly answer'd— ie Yes !" All eyes had centred on her beauteous face, The slightest signs of labouring thought to trace : While Richard, on whom her's were fix'd alone, To hide conflicting passions, screen'd his own ; Yet now he shares in Raymond's shuddering start, And a deep sob betray'd his tortured heart. (e Matilda ! Princess !" eager Raymond cried, " Oh ! pardon feelings which I cannot hide, Nor let—but can I speak and be forgiven,— 360 Ambition lure thee in the guise of heaven. To be the bond of peace, to free again That Tomb which myriads bled to win, in vain ; Proud is the destiny—so proud, so high, How gladly could I grasp such prize and die ! But years of misery wait thee ; 'tis not now Thy heart shall pay the penance of thy vow : Wounds are but spurs in battle's glorious day, 'Tis the slow cure that wears the soul away. To one—ah, pause!—a lawless Moslem, chain'd, 3/0 Thy faith contemn'd, thy liberty restrain'd, с 2
That sickness of the soul, the exile's curse, Which thine own virtues shall conspire to nurse— Like the cold silent drop that wears the stone, Shall waste thy cheek, till all its bloom be gone ; And as the wretch, becalmed on Indian seas, Decks the loath'd billows with imagin'd trees, Shall pining fancy paint thy natal shore,— E'en Etna's fires may charm, when fear'd no more. Think, though thy brother, as his rank commands, Supprest his grief, and named these hateful bands, Still anxious for thy weal he bids thee clmse— His heart will bless thee, should thy lips refuse." A painful blush her burning visage dyed, And with a voice supprest the Queen replied : " He could not glory in his sister's ¿hame ; His love might pardon, but his reason blame. Oh ! Raymond, more than thou or he ï know Each certain sacrifice, each threaten'd woe : What 'tis to part with all that sweetens life, 390 Yet lack whate'er endears the name of wife. Yet why such thoughts, when Sólyma shall be Freed to each Christian step, and freed by me ! Can I at such exalted lot repine, When pilgrims, crowding to each honour'd shrine,
With every bead a grateful tear shall shed, And call a blessing on Matilda's head ?— When, should my heart confess a moment's gloom, My lifted eye shall viesv a Saviour's Tomb ; And hope spring upsvard to that happier shore, 400 Where all I love shall meet—to part no more. Then rouse thee, Richard, hast thou causefor shame? Oh ! no, thy sister will not taint thy fame. Look on thy own Matilda, look, for here 'Tis I should falter, and 'tis thou should'st cheer." ' f Alas !" he answered, <( all tbe pride I feel In thy pure faith, thy self-devoted zeal, Makes but thy loss more dear ; yet shall not He Who feods the desert bird have charge of thee ? Strong in thy loneliness, perchance design'd 410 A torch of truth to that benighted kind ; But thy mild eye implores me, and I ss r ill— Dosvn, rebel heart ! ye struggling thoughts be still. " Princes ! who know what strife svas wont to stain Our loud debates, aud make our prowess vain ; lf now with me ye deem some mightier power Attunes our souls in this auspicious hour, Be peace our choice ; but let us still retain All by our ssvords redeem'd from Moslem reign ; с 3
Nor knit the bonds of concord, till we know 420 If Tyre's proud Chieftain rest a friend or foe. Fierce though he be, in one communion join'd, No separate truce our selfish hands should bind."— " Yet hear me, King, one moment I implore, By this, the ensign of my pastoral power !" 'Twas Hubert spoke. " I had not paused so long ? ( ' But hoped the sanction of some elder tongue. Richard, not yours the choice of' war or peace, Nor can yourselves your own free vows release : Alone to one on earth such power is given, 430 The one, unerring delegate of Heaven ; It may be He this compact shall allow, His praise confirm Matilda's generous vow : Yet, by your wealth, your blood, so nobly shed, Risk not his censure on your regal head ; Still let the choice be his, his sacred word, Which rousM to war, direct or sheathe the sword ; Wc need not fear our conquests to maintain, Till your swift envoy seek these shores again." e( Such mild reproofs, oh ! Prelate, ever bring The keenest shame," rejoin'd the generous King ; " I blush to think that my rebellious thought Could dream of treaty, his consent unsought.
To Celestine shall Leicester now repair, Our mandate thou to Asia's sovereign bear : Say Heaven's vicegerent only can release Our plighted faith, and sheathe our ssvords in peace ; Till his decree be known, we still must keep Our hostile state, nor let the conflict sleep." The Synod parts, and svith a friendly svind 450 Soon Leicester leaves the Syrian shore behind. And now the changing gales to Richard bear His mother's tablets, fraught svith sveighty care. " Hosv Ely govern'd svith too proud a hand, Till discontent was rife throughout the land ; And John, to rebel courses ever prone, Declared his brother dead, and claim'd the throne." tc Alas ! dear England ! while I speak, perchance These broils are foster'd by perfidious France. (Forgive me, comrade of my youth, that now 460 My heart has bodings which distrust thy vosv ;) Yet hence vain fears—to Heaven my sword was given, And my lone kingdom is the charge of Heas r cn," Arsouf meanss r hile, despoii'd of all her pride, Daroun and Ramla fling their portals svide ; f i
While Jaffa, svhich the Soldan threats in vain, Exulting turns to Christian rule again. From Tyre to Gaza, Palestine implores The conqueror's mercy, and receives his powers. The Moslems, scarce in menaced Sion sure, 470 With stronger svalls her native strength secure ; And Richard leads his gallant comrades on, To win Damascus' rival—Ascalon. Each eager eye explored the naked plain, And scann'd th' horizon's ample bound in s r ain. No marble domes the vacant scene adorn, No gilded turrets glitter in the morn ; From no strong fort the tasvny standard flies ; Nor svalls, nor tosvers, nor minarets arise. (i Oft have I heard," the svondering Pardo cried, " That imps malign in Asian wilds reside ; In arid sands bid seeming lak^s delude, And shade with gorgeous piles the mimic flood : But now, methinks, some envious demon shrouds The actual city in aerial clouds."— ' ( Nay," Albert spoke, ζζ observe upon our right в Those losv-built dsvellings, glittering in the light, Like Moslem tombs ; they speak the city nigh, 'Tis but yon grove that veils it from the eye."
Ssvift to the spot the eager troops advance, 490 Then, fill'd svith assc, exchange th' inquiring glance. " Where is the proud, the mighty city gone ? Were these white stones imperial Ascalon ? " Far as the keen-eyed lynx can measure round The splendid fragments cover all the ground; The column's broken shaft, the painted dome, Soft carpets, glowing from the Persian loom, Mirrors and cloth of gold, defiled and scorn'd, That tell how rich the halls they once adorn'd. But all svas silent, save the breeze that sigh'd 500 O'er those fair ruins, late an empire's pride. Has earth, beneath the sveight of marble prest, Heaved the proud structure from her jealous breast? Or man, unfaithful to his father's trust, The луогк of ages levelľd svith the dust ? Oh ! not when Carthage met her dreadful doom, In rival vengeance seal'd by conquering Rome, When nor rude axe nor hungry flame forbore, And night and silence fled th' affrighted shore : Not then her sons o'er fairer domes besvaiľd, 510 In ruin scatter'd or in fire exhaled. Nosv changed the scene : svith painful steps they trod Where treacherous ashes hide the burniug sod ;
And ever, as some smouldering heap they broke, Oozed from its black recess the heated smoke. The vulture haunts the desert house of prayer, The ruin'd palace is th' hyena's lair ; And wondering thousands unreproved explore Sequester'd beauty's desolated bower— Her pomp, her pride, her busy crowds are gone, 520 And Syria's spouse is fall'n like Babylon. One tower alone, a massy structure, stood, Reared on the confines of the land and flood ; Though scathed with flame, with angry blows assail'd, Dark frown'd its antique walls, and steel and fire had fail'd.* Wondering the warriors view th' unshaken stone,— When from its vaults resounds a sullen moan ! Keen was their search, and soon in piteous plight They drag a wasted wretch to upper light. On his dark brow, though stain'd with dust, were seen Some tatter'd shreds of Mecca's holy green ; His beard was silver'd with the snows of age, Yet glared his eyes with unextinguish'd rage ; While, as from some sepulchral cavern, came A voice ill-suited to so worn a frame,
With quivering lips, but unabated pride, To Richard's words the spectre form replied : " But that the tale may grieve thee, Infidel i Not all thy tortures should one sound compel. Go gaze on Shiraz, on Damascus gaze, 540 Or where through Cassius' vale Orontes strays ; Bid Saba all her spicy wealth exhale, CuU all the sweets of Cashmere's palmy vale ; Then may'st thou guess how fair thy treasure gone, And half the pride of ruin'd Ascalon ! But far her splendour and her wealth above Her zealous offspring prized their Prophet's love,— That never here should Infidel command, Or Egypt's wealth be borne to Christian hand,* They vow'd—they heard of Acre's fall—again 550 The screaming vultures told of Arsouf s plain ; Dark o'er the splendid domes a cloud was hung, And night and day with direful portents rung. The fated city knew her hour was come, And the sad Soldan, shuddering spoke her doom. Yet t'was not when the powerful throng'd the gate, When camels sunk beneath their costly freight ;
When music wail'd, or houri forms were seen Half to undraw the silken palanquin, To see once more the only home they knew, 560 And left but once, yet left for ever too ; Nor when the new, the gorgeous palace fell, That desolation rais'd her fearful yell. The great have wealth to м in another home, And spread a Paradise where'er they roam ; But when the poor, that saw their dwellings fall, In every little hut bewail'd their all,— When houseless infants round their fathers clung, When on their arms their wives imploring hung,— E'en by their very weight to stay the blow, 570 And check an arm already weak with woe ; 'Twas then the Soldan wept, and in despair, Called on his Mufties to relent and spare— Th' averted head, that sought the mantle's fold, The frequent sob, their dreadful sentence told ; * Oh ! I had rather that these walls had stood, Like Acre, purpled with her offspring's blood ; But Islam's weal demands'—he spoke, and then Snatch'd the red torch, and led his weeping train. Himself he fired whate'er was precious, rare, 580 The tombs of ancient "-aints, the mosques of prayer ;
Till the high feeling caught from man to man, Each with his home the svork of fate began ; O'er its slosv wreck his sullen vigil kept, The eye was tearless, 'twas the heart that wept. Each fatal hour some princely pile consumed, Night after night terrific fires illumed ; Till the dark heavens their silent sorrosvs shed O'er the wide havoc svhich their svinds had spread.h " Mourn, then, tbou miscreant ! thou the cause of all! On thee may Islam's gather'd curses fall ! Think of this jesvel lost, the sveight of care, The toils, the battles thou hast yet to dare, With those who thus to death and flames consign All they most love, ere they svill yield it thine." f ' Think thou svhat fervor Christian hearts must fill Who strive svith such, nor doubt of conquest still ! Short is your triumph :" thus the King replies, (t This phœnix from her fuueral flames shall rise. Exult! my friends! proud city! live once more. 600 Thy sons destroy'd thee, but thy foes restore.— Go ! tell thy Lord, in vain his soul exceeds All record shews of great and daring deeds; Undazzled we his radiant course can trace, And hope to match—perchance outstrip his race."
" Even as thou wilt, but here my sorrows close ; This spot that first beheld shall end my woes— Once blest svith all that mortal might desire, A happy husband, an exulting sire, I prized Morayma's svorth all wealth above, 610 Nor gave a rival to her faithful love. The plague broke forth—svith every svretched day My comrades died, my household pined away ; My children sicken'd—less than mother's care Had turn'd appall'd from features late so fair; But fearless, speechless, o'er their couch of death That angel watch'd, nor shunn'd their tainted breath ; Till as her fingers, moisten'd in the wave, To their blue lips a moment's freshness gave, She sunk, Affection's martyr, at my side, 620 Raised to my face her pitying eyes, and died ! What follosved ask not—stupor seized my frame, I saw not, heard not, till svhen reason came I stood on yonder tower ; the Eunuchs gas r e My heart's lost treasure to a svat'iy grave ; Pale, but yet lovely, for not death might dare To change the mansion of a soul so fair. Still with her last, her fondest look, she gazed, And as she fell her snowy arms svere rais'd—
Was it a dream—they pointed to my boy, 630 The latest, dearest pledge of vanish'd joy ! I snatch'd him from the slaves, I watch'd the луауе Till even its ripples died, then sought the cave Where late you found me stretch'd, and, spent and wild, Gazed like a nurse that tends her sleeping child. I could not pray, I had no hope,—I sate As one whose senseless sorrosv mock'd at fate. Methought he moved, and svith the sudden start The blood thrilľd backsvard from my stiffening heart. For hours I felt his languid temples beat, 640 And gently chafed the slosv-returning heat; Till tearb, to ease my bursting bosom, came, Warm'd his cold limbs, relax'd his rigid frame,— Why need I say hosv my young Ali gresv "4 Whate'er my hopes had feign'd, my svishes knesv, > And pleasure's emptied chalice brimm'd anesv ! J Nor careless of the posver that saved his days, On Mecca's sands 1 knelt in prayer and praise. Heard'st thou not, Heaven!—but gaze not thus опте, Christian ! my svoes shall be no jest for thee !" 650 " Where is this boy ?" " Where ! that should I demand— u On Arsouf's plain he perish'd by thy hand!
Where sleeps he now ? perchance that cruel breast— 'Tis said thy hatred loves the impious feast." 1 u Nay, 'tis thy frenzied malice forged the tale— Old man, I know how little words avail, Yet oft I mourn the blood my hand has shed ; What would'st thou now ? can I relieve or aid ?" " No ! nought from thee—not aught from Christian hand ; Not e'en to hide these aged limbs with sand, 6Ţ0 Will Helim ask—not sorrow's last request To share his Ali's grave—that barbarous breast. Recoiling Nature points a fitter tomb ; Yet glory not, while gazing on my doom ; Here in the grave shall ail my griefs repose, But thy rash triumph finds no quiet close. For me the gates of Paradise unfold, For me Al Cawthar chafes its sands of gold.* For me th' eternal groves of Eden flower, For me Morayma decks her pearly bower. 680 Hark ! for the warbling gates invite me in— But thou, aye drain thy painted cup of sin ; Drain to the dregs, for poison harbours there, Then sleep—the trump shall wake thee to despair."
At once his limbs a youthful vigour found, And breaking from th' astonish'd guards around, Onward he springs, with Herculean posver Clasps the rough stones, and climbs the lofty tower. t( That prayer at least th' Eternal heard," he said, " The axes broke, the hungry flames were staid, 690 Now fall, and svhelm yon interdicted traiu ;"— Then svildly gazing on the foaming main, " I come, Morayma, to thy tranquil grave."— He spoke, and plunged and perish'd in the wave. Now through the desert town the Monarch hies, Marks the svide moat, or bids the ramparts rise. " Here form the massy citadel, and here Shrin'd in its breast Messiah's temple rear ; k A princely bower, a spacious arsenal there ; And svhere those orange groves bloom fresh and fair, Let the calm convent from their bosom rise, \ And holy hymns, and penitential sighs, ч Float with their native incense to the skies." y Vast was the labour,—but the means were vast ; An army svrought, and proudest Princes cast Their crested helms and blazon'd vests aside, To mix in works a Monarch deign'd to guide : vol. п. о
While, proud to labour'on a foreign soil, The meaner crowd resum'd their wonted toil ; And many an Arab youth, or Nubian slave, 7Ю Wrought for his hire, yet curs'd the hand that gave. The portly Mede, the supple Greek were near, And frigid Georgia's blue-eyed mountaineer ; The Israelite, scarce suffer'd in the land Where rul'd his father's by divine command, And rich Armenia's active sons unfold Their gem-wrought hangings and their stuffs of gold. They blend with gothic masses, rude, grotesque, The varying charms of playful arabesque, The forms of classic Greece, severely chaste, 720 Or the light polish of Ionian taste. Yet not to Ascalon the mighty mind Of England's Monarch all its force confin'd : Oft with slight train he scour'd the hostile land, Strong forts subdued, and routed many a band ; His rank in vain a crestless casque conceal'd, The puissant arm the " Lion Heart" reveaľd. Once, when the King and two tried svarriors more The white Bernoose of Arab wanderers svore,
They reach'd a lofty hill, whence glancing down 730 With raptur'd eyes they view'd the Sacred Town. Bright in the glowing autumn's sunset beam Thy vale, Geheuna, and the winding stream Of torrent Kedron, while a ruddier glow Tinged the Green Mount, and Sion's adverse brow. Beneath, half cloth' d in light, half lost in gloom, That fane whose walls enclose a Saviour's tomb ; And that proud mosque, whose gilded turrets shine Where erst Jehovah fix'd his chosen shrine ; There beams the crescent, tliere iu triumph glow 740 The yellow banners of Messiah's foe. It was a sight to fire a warrior's brain : With armed hosts he crowds the vacant plain ; Godfrey, Rinaldo, Bœmond, Tancred, rise, From huge machines the stony tempest flies, And martial clamours thicken on his ear, Triumphant notes, himself may hope to hear ! With outstretch'd arms he views the beauteous town, tr Shalt thou," he cries, " shalt thou be yet my own ?" And tears, yet such as valour's cheeks may grace, Unbidden, wondering, dew'd his manly face. Fast wanes the day ; they spur their camp to gain, Till in a glen they mark'd a Moslem train. n 2
Bold in disguise, the hostile ranks they scan,— 'Twas sultry Mecca's annual caravan : Bound from that shrine where countless pilgrims hold The double rites of Islam and of gold.* The Zem zem 's sacred wave, and odorous spicef From India brought, and silks of rare device, Brooms with the Caaba's precious cobwebs graced,î And Korans that the holiest hands had traced ; A thousand treasures dear to Moslem eyes, Oman's rich pearls, and gems that all can prize, The loaded camels to Damascus bear, Safe in the guard of Mosul's dauntless heir. But Richard with a leader's rapid sight View'd as he past th' encampment of the night ; Then home he hastens, and selects with care A knightly band, the bold emprize to dare. While yet their course the doubtful twilight veiľd, Each in a Bedouin's ample cloak conceal'd,
Urged his fleet Destrier ; morning mists were still Drawn like a curtain round each swelling bill, When the glad Monarch from a lofty brow Points to the pilgrims in the glen below. Some stretched beneath their steeds repose supine,* Some on buge bales of costly stuffs recline ; Some, where light tents exclude the dews of night, Or the dim watchfire fades in purer light ; While some, more wakeful, roused the lingering guard/ 780 The camels loaded, and the steeds prepared. Now all was life, and 'mid the busy train The camels knelt, and burthen'd, rose again. The prancing steeds the breath of morning feel, The fearless pilgrims snatch their simple meal ; When hark ! the tambour every breast alarms ! The coward flies, the warriors spring to arms : Yet half in scorn survey the scanty band Of Bedouin wanderers, refuse of the land ;,ρ 3
Hardy and brave, yet all unskill'd to cope .790 With Mosul's veterans, and her princely hope. But soon their pride was quell'd, when doom'd to feel The weight of England's mace, and England's steel. From rank to rank a panic terror spread, And from the little troop the thousands fled. Join'd by the few that fought, with lance in rest, To Richard's front Seiffeddin's offspring prest. " Shekh, of what tribe and whosoe'er thou art, Not this methinks a true believer's part— When foreign wolves, rude, merciless, and bold, ч Molest our faithful flocks, for lust of gold V The shepherd should not rob his neighbour's fold." y No answer Richard deign'd, but cast aside The dosvny cloth that veil'd his helmet's pride. The Prince look'd round—are all his warriors gone ! Gone at that dreaded glance?—he stands alone ! Yet unabash'd, resolved his fate to brave, Nor stain a life that flight might fail to save. When Richard : " Thou whom e'en thy foes admire, 2 For happier fields restrain thy martial fire ; 810r Go to thy Sultan, to thy warlike Sire, / And say that England's King rejoiced to see How truly fame had spoke in praising thee.
Say more, we bid them not too idly trust, For Ascalon is rising from her dust ; Ourselves have seen where Sion's towers ascend— When next we see, we warn them to defend." With graceful mien th' intrepid Prince obeys, Pleased and yet blushing at a Christian's praise. T'was strange, the syren that his fancy sway'd, 820 In darkest hues the once-loved King pourtray'd, He vow'd revenge—yet whensoe'er they met, He gazed admiring, and forgot to hate. O'er fraud so much prevail'd his generous mind, Nor strife could jaundice, nor affection blind. Now whispering Pardo near, he gaily smiled, e( Hast thou no greetings for Almanzor's child?"— t£ What should I send? why speak of smouldering fires, Of memory lingering on, when Hope expires?"— " Send love and joy," his laughing friend replies : a If thou hast seen where Sion's ramparts rise, Thou know'st by Silöe's brook her Golden Gate ;* If there some moonless night thou dare to wait Till the mid-watch be set, I know a spell May ope the Haram's jealous doors—farewell.—,d 4
Better to rush on death than thus to pine, And if betray'd, my life is risqued with thine." But Richard's eye o'er countless spoils has run, And marvelľd at the wealth his valour won. Nor were his numerous vassals less elate, 840 When camels throng'd the city's spacious gate ;* And e'en the miser wearied to behold Silks, carpets, camphor, frankincense and gold. Largely he gave to each confederate band, And friends and aliens blest his bounteous hand, In terms that sicken'd Otho's envious ear, And Gaul's proud Barons burn'd with shame to hear. But as the sun through cloudless æther glides, Regardless of the meaner orbs he hides, In plenitude of splendour beaming round 850 His light of life to earth's remotest bound ; Thus through his radiant course the Monarch goes, Blest in each blessing that his hand bestows.,END OF BOOK IX,

CŒUR DE LION.,BOOK X.,THE QUARREL OF RICHARD AND LEOPOLD. So swift, while myriads lent their willing aid, The city rose, so wide her circuit spread, That Islam ponder'd on her tales of old, When Solyman the sons of fire control'd, And piled stupendous many a fabric fair, Colossal works ! man's envy and despair. 'Twas night—with unaccustom'd toil opprest, Now Peers and Princes seek the couch of rest ; When hark ! a thousand clamorous tongues require The wearied king—the lords return from Tyre. 10
Impatient throngs explore each clouded look, That told of evil ere a word was spoke. And soon with tears was many a cheek bedew'd, For sad the tale—a tale of guilt and blood. From Acre's plain the noble envoys crost Scandalion's ridge, and gain'd the Tyrian coast. By Asia's fervid suns unnerved no more, Now Philip linger'd on Phoenicia's shore ; While Saladine, with policy refined, In princely gifts display'd his courteous mind. 20 With these, to heal the Monarch's languid frame, Abdollatiph, the pride of Asia, came, a With all the lore of Ind or Persia fraught, That Avicene, or sage Averrhoes taught ; b That Grecian erst, or wise Chaldæan told, And all Damascus' royal schools unfold. Unwearied yet he hastens to explore, What lingering knowledge lives on Nilus' shore ; That shore where first she lit her mystic fire, So soon to flourish, and so soon expire. 30 And now, though grief for Arsouf s ravish'd fight Secludes the Soldan from his servant's sight, His bounty graced the sage—he bids him shesv His wonted svisdom, and restore his foe.
But vain was all his healing skill to find The King's disease, the canker of the mind ; As vain the zealous Prelate's earnest prayer, \ Or envious Austria's, filľd with timely fear, V Lest hated Richard rule without a Peer. } " Canst thou," the Duke began, (e so deeply taste Of glory's cup, yet quit the rich repast ? Or see those laurels by thy vassal won, Which, near his lord, he durst not call his own ?" ťf Degenerate offspring of a sainted sire," The priest exclaim'd, with all a zealot's fire, " Flow far unlike to him whose active youth Bled in the cause of Sion and of truth ;* Whose honour'd age a pontiff's wants supplied, And gave that home his rebel states denied, 0 Thou, but that bounteous Heaven delay'd thy reign, Hadst join'd the kings of England and Almayne. How may'st thou now, oh, sceptred recreant ! bear That outraged palm, that Cross abandon'd wear ? Or yield at Dionysius' honour'd shrine, With festal hymns, his Oriflamme divine ?f,Philip
Thy injur'd God beholds ; he speaks his claim In that gaunt malady which wastes thy frame. His curse shall linger on thy tainted life, Treason, and conflict, and domestic strife." They plead, they threat,—but prayers and threats are vain, 60 He climbs his ship, and launches on the main ; To Paris' walls the Soldan's gifts he bore, A nation's wonder on that distant shore. Far other Conrad's mien,—austere and high, He checked reproof, and made a proud reply : " Prelate, forbear thy threats, and thou, my friend, These vain entreaties,—Conrad cannot bend. I once defied your church, and know that man May live and prosper though he bear its ban.* Me nor false hopes nor bigot zeal inspire, 70 My quest dominion, glory my desire. Would Richard win my love, its price is known, I treat with none that brings not Sion's crown : Though well is all his former scorn repaid, When that proud tyrant seeks Montferraťs aid.
Yet Leopold, even for thy triple claim Of kindred blood, of danger, and of fame, Thus far I yield :—On my behalf to treat, Now Sidon's Prince and Asia's Soldan meet ; Wait then th' event,—should Ayoub's son decline 8!) The peace, then Richard's foes again are mine. But mark ! no more in common fight to blend- Foe of his foe, but never Richard's friend." Impatiently they waited many a day, Λ Till Conrad kindled at the long delay, > His greatness outraged in his herald's stay ; J He scorned to veil his thoughts, and at a feast, Whose princely splendour dazzled either guest, i( Let Saladine beware," he sternly said, " Dire be my warfare if he scorn my aid !" 90 The Prelate, anxious still th' accord to bind, And fix the changing current of his mind, Cried, as he pledged him in Ionian wine, " As I your guest, be you to-morrow miue." Day past, and bright the evening banquet shone, And Conrad graced the feast, but not alone ; Rinaldo swell'd his train % and, ere he spoke,* The envoys knew th' expected concord broke.
Their blighted hopes alike the Tyrians feel, And all in silence sped their tasteless meal j 100 When Conrad rising, from his purple vest Drew forth a scroll, and thus the Peers addrest : ' ť The Soldan, yielding to our terms of peace, Is well content to bid the contest cease ; Unransom'd he restores our captive sire,* He owns us sovereign potentates of Tyre :— Envoys of England, learn your errand vain, And tell your Lord, that when we meet again The ground he holds his falchion must maintain." The Austrian stood aghast, in mute amaze,— 110 " All-seeing power !" cried Philip of Beauvais, Sl Was ever yet so foul an union sped ? Heaven linked with Hell, the living with the dead !" " Peace, Prelate, peace! and practise what you teach :-— Go ! to your own neglected Normans preach j But learn I govern here ', and Tyrian lords Are wont to guard their honour with their swords. What, thine is sharp ! but let its hilt be still, This froward humour suits thy mitre ill ;
Though well I deem, of' Asia's Pagan throng 120 Thy steel has more converted than thy tongue. Nor on my head the holy thunders cast, My breast is adamant, it scorns the blast ; And policy forbids to hurl them forth Save on the fools whose terrors raise their worth. Yet more,—that Uichard, whom your zealots sing The Church's prop, the model for a King, He too is leagued with Saladine !—'tis said He yields his sister's charms to Adcl's bed. Nay \vhy that unbelieving scorn ? Behold 130 The wondrous legend, character'd in gold ! May I not now the proud example own ? Or are his faults in Richard prais'd alone?" iC Not so, blaspheming wretch ! Alike on all Who stain our faith, th' impartial censures fall ; The more I lately prized his worth, the more I blame his fall—I wonder and deplore. But thou, that Heaven's great delegate defied, Thou worse than faithless to a blameless bride, Link'd with another's wife, in bonds that shame 140 Revolted Europe, and the Christian name ! No wonder can another crime impart ; The interdict I spare is in thy heart. vol. и. к
Heaven suffers long, but svill not always bear ; Its s'engeance may be near thee—Prince, besvare !" The Prelate cetsed ; but where was Conrad gone ? Threat'ning he left the crowded hall alone, But back he came not. Hark ! that piercing shriek, Which drives the blood from every fading cheek ! Each seized a torch, and rushing forth in fear, 150 Ran to a grove that rose in darkness near. They start, they scream, 'twas Conrad's bleetling form, So lately rich with life, with fury warm, Thus murder'd, unconfessing, unforgiven. And meditating outrages on Heaven. Beside him sate a female, ghastly, fair, As though to shame the torches' ruddy glare, Struggling through stormy clouds, tbe moonlight threw On her pale form a cold unearthly hue. Hosv sunk her rayless eye î her cheek hosv spare ! Yet beauty, rapture, love, had once been there ; And passion's April changes lent their glosv To features fix'd in deadliest anguish now. Forgetful of herself, of all around, Her soul seem'd lost in Conrad's gory wound. Sf Too svell avenged," in smother'd tones she cried, And tore her robes to stop the welling tide.
Scarce was their midnight deed of horror sped, When at her phrenzied shriek th' assassins fled. With desperate impulse to his side she flew, I7O At once her pitying glance he caught and knew ; O'er his stern brow a strong convulsion past, The pang she gave his keenest and his last. The Leach approach'd ; with accents of command And frantic look she check'd th' officious hand ; " Hold ! hold ! not Isabelle should now divide My Conrad from his first, his lawful bride. She has not rights so holy, so divine, Hers was his living couch, his grave be mine. Methinks (yet ah! these sunken eyes are dim, 180 And all around unreal shadows swim,) Yet if some bold Crusaders hear me now, That heard in Sophia's fane our bridal vow, Defend, I charge ye, by your fathers' fame, To that last home sad Theodora's claim. Oh ! from that hour when fame too truly shew'd His broken faith, and o'er the angry flood I came, rash pilgrim, fated to behold,— But hush ! and be the guilty rites untold,— I fled, I lived,—but ask not where or how ; 190 Somewhat of cold, of drenching damps I know, к 2
Of mountain caves, of chambers of the dead, Of hinds that from my moonlight spectre fled, Of happy chance, behind a leafy screen That shesv'd my Conrad's form, my own unseen : One hope sustain'd me—Oh, mysterious Heaven, Wh) is it cross'd ? ss'by died he unforgiven ? I lived to tread tbe earth that Conrad trod, To reconcile the offending wretch to God j I lived —J saw him fall a murderer's prey, 200 I sasv his spirit pass unblest away.— Earth i« a desert now, and oh, despair! Heas en too svere joyless, for hc is not there ! {i But see that drop—those noble limbs are chill ! But round lib heart svarm life may linger itili ; Mine too are cold—the fever of my brain Has buck'd the blood from every waited vein. Yet could I to his bleeding frame resign The last faint heat that feebly beats in mine, 'Twere svorth whole lives for meaner purpose given, The »take eternity, the purchase Heaven." She stretched her limbs upon his lifeless breast, To hte cold cheek her paler lips she prest, And clung svith such a fond, devoted grace, She seem'd to slumber in the dear embrace.
At length they raised her, but her languid head Hung powerless back, and either soul had fled. How fares the Queen ?—the heart that shed no tear For her lost sister, mourns not o'er their bier. Yet for herself she feels, her power is gone, 220 Her dreams of glory fled—she stands alone. Where may she fly, to what protector turn ' The good must hate her, and the proud would spurn. Thoron once loved her, and if she descend To kneel for pardon—no ! she could not bend. In sooth the dame, of rarest beauty vain, Had mark'd its power on Henry of Champagne ; She knew him young, ambitious, fond of rule, Yet one a meaner mind than hers might school, And more, his blood to England's King allied, 230 Might win respect for claims he late denied,— She called her maidens, deign'd such weeds to wear As made each beauteous feature seem more fair ; Left Tyre and all its weeping train behind, Coil'd like a serpent round her lover's mind ; And ere the day when funeral anthems gave Her lord and victim to their silent grave, Again was Acre stain'd with guilty joy, At rites that outraged every holy tye. c E 3
" Oh !" cried the Prelate, ťí dim the day arose, 240 And sad and silent linger'd to its close, When through the Tyrian streets the funeral train With solemn pomp moved on to Mary's fane. The night array'd in sorrow's dismal hue, Round each red torch her gloomy circle drew, And faintly shew'd, on one dark bier disclosed, Where, pale in death, th' illustrious pair reposed. No sound was heard, nor sob, nor labouring sigh, Though the big tear stood round in every eye, Till with the dirge the solemn chorus rose, 250 The single utterance of a nation's woes. For Conrad, though on Heaven's behests he trod Reckless, and chose ambition for his god, To regal cares his powerful mind addrest, And made his city great, his people blest. The priests in stoles of unpolluted white, The mournful household clad in robes of night ; Warriors whose hearts a warrior's loss deplored, Youth, manhood, age, all sorrowing for their lord, Exiles to whom his power a home had given, 260 And monks and virgins dedicate to heaven : All wan and ghastly as th' unconscious dead, Breath'd a low prayer with every tear they shed.
But most that aged priest, svhose just alarms For menaced Sion rous'd her sons to arms ; To Europe's Kings his Tyrian crozier bore, And preached the new Crusade from shore to shore. He from his cell, where sinking to the tomb, He writes in tears his chronicle of gloom, Look'd on the world once more ; with feeble breath The aged patriarch rais'd the chaunt of death, Yet oh ! if ever prayer from heart sincere Avail to speed the parted soul, or e'er Might earthly mould angelic soul enshrine, Or human sorrow touch the ear Divine, William of Tyre, thy tears for Conrad shed, Thy hymns, not idly o'er the marble said, Shall aid the latest wish, the latest sigh Of her he wrong'd to win his peace on high." d Such was the tale that spread through all the host Dismay and gloom, but Richard sorrosv'd most ; And from the hall in mournful silence stole, To vent alone the sadness of his soul. The Princes linger'd there, and still aghast In every varying light review'd the past ; к 4
Till Otho, svho with Hauteforťs Baron bold, And Raymond talk'd apart, and Leopold, Exclaim'd, " Methinks the sveightier sense sve lose Of Conrad's death, in Theodora's woes. No stripling's arm could stretch him on the sand, 290 Whose then the guiding will—the acting hand ?" " Whose !" Bertrand spoke, by hatred self-deceiv'd, To utter words that hatred scarce believ'd ; u Whose, but the man that profits in his fall, He, now the proudest, mightiest of us all ; Who talk'd of peace (a peace hc means to break), Yet brook'd not Conrad separate terras should seek ; 'Tis plain—his nephew weds the widosv'd dame, To rise on Lusignan's abandon'd claim." " Prais'd be St. Ursula !" cried Leopold, 300 " A stranger's tongue my secret thought has told. Princes ! for Conrad's blood, so basely shed, His kinsman claims revenge on Richard's head. Yet who would dare a frowning front to shesv, Who breathe suspicion on so proud a foe ?" il Who?" Raymond answer'd in indignant tone, л " All that believe the tale ! not England's throne, \ But Richard's virtue makes our swords his own. 1
Vengeance on him, if he that blood have spilt, Vengeance on both the partners of his guilt ! 310 On Philip of Beauvais, on Leopold— Nay, let its sheath thine angry weapon hold ; But if by Richard's will the Prince were slain, The murderous hand was in his envoy's train." " Nay ! who," said Otho, " heeds th' ignoble hand, If his the profit, his the will that plann'd. Be silent, flatterer ! for the glorious sun Oft shews a blot, and Richard may have one." " Methinks I ill have earn' d a flatterer'« name. Who singly dared the peace he urged to blame ; 320 Nay, deem'd me wrong'd, because he ne'er descried, And outraged feelings I had sought to hide. Yet, prais'd be heaven ! his merit shines too high To dread the mists that dim our nether sky. Pause, ere you dare so base a thought impart, Or meet the scorn of every honest heart." Speaking he turn'd—fierce Bertrand through the gloom, Gazed on his stately step and tossing plume : " Go thou, for nought thy trusting soul could move, So fix'd in Richard's— or his sister'» love ; 330
Thy generous zeal has something wildly great, I honour thee for loving him I hate." " Will then that hatred," Otho urged, ťí combine, In quest of just revenge, thy force with mine ?" " Aye, where ye list—slight cause unsheathes my brand, But hate like this might nerve a dead man's hand." The wily Austrian murmur'd : " Count, beware ! Let Raymond's anger teach a timely fear ; He shines too high for force to reach his throne, Our vengeance lies in secret means alone." 340 But Bertrand starts,—his eyes that flash with fire, And wrinkled brow, bespeak ungovern'd ire. " By secret means î could I to such descend, He had not lived to trust thee as a friend. I hate him, and to feed that hate have given More than my earthly bliss, my hopes of Heaven. Those black suspicions, crafty Leopold, That first I dared to breathe, I dare uphold. 'Twere joy to find them stablish'd, but beware ! For should your meanness meditate a snare, 350 A timely warning in his ear to speak, Where the best vengeanceBertrand'shatecouklseek?"
He too is gone ; with eyes upon the ground Stood either chief, then cautious glanced around ; Then rais'd, then dropp'd, as each had fear'd to trace Indignant virtue in his fellow s Tace; Till half assured the wary Austrian bends, Half breathes in smother'd accents, "Are we friends ?" " Yea, to the death !" stout Otho's answer came From lips that moved not, and a rigid frame. 360 t( What then the means ?" the fraudful Duke exprest, " All means are sacred, and the safest best ; But to my tent for further speech remove, Lest Bertrand's honour watch, or Raymond's love." Short was the rest the active Monarch knew, And the cool dawning's first empurpled hue Amid his rising works beheld him stand, To aid his noble labourers and command. ťc Yet why, my Lord of Austria," Richard said, i( Do now your knights withhold their wonted aid ? Such high-born chiefs have mingled in the task, 'Twere scarce too much your princely hand to ask." " No, proud Plantagenet, I am not skill'd The block to fashion, or the trowel wield.*
Such arts may suit thy kestrel kind, for fame Hath been familiar with thy mother's name— Thou should'st not bid expecting heirs inquire If England's Sovereign had a regal sire ; My high-bred eagle soars a nobler flight, Nay, scorns to slay a foe except in fight." 380 Oh ! who ean speak the Monarch's wrath—his hand Unconscious grasp'd, half drew, then sheath'd the brand. " Now by yon orb that rising gilds the sphere, A coward only would insult me here ! Thou know'st the holy νοΛν$ that bind me fast ; In Europe breath'd, those words had been thy last. Yes is it here, beneath Duke Robert's hand, Where fell the leader of the Parthian band, Whose trophies yet the dauntless deed proclaim ; Thou därest to trample on my parents' fame ! 390 But give thy slander words, injurious Lord ! What secret blood has tarnish'd Richard's sword ?" Now had he fail'd, but Otho's piercing eye Forced from his livid lips the firm reply. " And think'st thou, tyrant, did no bonds confine My lips from challenge, I would wait for thine ? That Conrad's blood had cried to Heaven so long, Had less than Heaven cornpell'd to bear the wrong ?
But here I brave not one beyond the laws, Nor trust to doubtful steel a kinsman's cause ; 400 For Rome I sail, and even thou may'st dread The only belts that strike a regal head." ic Proud Duke, thy aid is free—or sail or stay ; Thou need'st not storm, I shall not bar thy way. Thy falsehoods to repel, to shew thy guile I svill not stoop, they but deserve a smile. And, Lords, ye know that for the general sveal, Not for my own, I urged your svilling zeal, To raise these tosvers ; yet if by conscience moved To shun a treaty ye so late approved, 410 On to Jerusalem, but vow with me Never to leave her till you leave her free, While our tough lances boast one barb of steel, Or our best steeds can yield a single meal." e His truncheon high exulting Bertrand shook, i( Spake I not sooth, these hateful bonds are broke ! Oh, how I love the very name of svar, And like a vulture snuff the scent afar ! Yet think not, King, that Leopold alone With Conrad's murder stains the English throne, 420 For all svho knosv svhat shameless rites combine Champagne and Isabelle, the rest divine."
" Nor think," said Otho, " we will bleed and toil, That thou may'st wear the glory and the spoil ; I sail with Leopold, and svith me bear The force Augustus trusted to my care. Thou too wert best to quit this purple field, To guard thine honour, and thy realms to shield." " Sail then !" cried Richard—" may the favouring gales Be ever prompt to swell your recreant sails, 430 That your own lips may first your flight reveal— Oh ! never truly touch'd with holy zeal, To yield a prey that almost courts your hand ! Sail then—but here I fix my proudest stand ; My glory living or my death betray'd, Shall stamp your infamy, and mock your aid. And oh ! for England—solemnly 'twas given To noble Eleanor, to guardian Heaven, To Heaven's vicegerent here ; and Celestine Will brook no hand should strike one fort of mine ; While still she boasts her ships, her hearts of oak, Let those be strong that meditate the stroke : Her steel to death such sheep-clad wolves shall doom, The Pontiffs curses to the death to come."
They saiľd, but still the lofty works went on, And rose in finish'd beauty, Ascalon ; While all the faithful höst with one accord Confirm their vows, and rally round their Lord. Yet small the space their narrowing camp conceal'd, And thin their columns on the darken'd field j 450 No longer theirs the overwhelming weight, To rush on Sion, and command her fate. Their leader, watchful precious blood to spare, Now bids them frame those vast machines of war, The Catapult, the Ram with brazen head, The giant slings that blazing arrows shed, The light fascines in hollow moats to fall, The rolling towers that match the hostile wall ; With all those " Torments" Roman art employed, And all that Milan's massive works destroy'd.* 460 Yet, for the mind its generous force may spend, And skilful archers oft their bows unbend, Not seldom was the tilt ; the new built halls Were gay with sumptuous feasts and courtly balls,
And oft in Sharon's woods tbe tardy morn Rous'd at the chiding of the hunter's horn ; And oft, a polish'd boar-spear in her hand, Behind some copse svould Berengaria stand, Robed like the Virgin-Huntress of the svood, To svatch the beast and shed his sable blood. 470 Or on her palfrey, whose resplendent white Display'd his jesvelľd seat and housings bright, With hooded falcon on her wrist she came, To svound in air the many-tinctured game. One morn more loud th' inspiring bugles blesv. To higher pitch the keen-eyed falcons flesv, The full voic'd hounds the guiding leash disdain, The snorting steeds impatient tug the rein. Fired at the sight, " Do thou, my gentle bride, Λ War with the plumy race, while on sve ride 480V For nobler game," tbe royal hunter cried. y Already had his eager chace subdued Th' inferior tenants of the mazy wood, And to the camp his train in triumph bear The cunning fox, swift deer, and timid hare ; When high in cloudless noon the orb of day Pierc'd the thick branches with a sultry ray,
And Richard sought, to shun the burning beat, In thicker shades a cool and calm retreat. Albert and Pardo by their sovereign rode 490 \ In converse on the chase, svhen near tbem stood V A mighty boar, the monarch of the ss r ood. J Him nor their weapons nor their shoutb dismay— He views, he circles, and affronts his prey. Furious, immense, the dreadful beast appears, With horrent bristles and erected ears ; With hideous roar th' affrighted grove he fills, And o'er his gnashing tusks the foam distills ; But Richard, watchful to prevent his foe, Aim'd at his mighty chest th' unerring blow ; 500 Deep sunk the spear, but high the monster stood, Seized svith Ыч paws, and tugg'd and snapp'd the svood. Maddening svith pain and rage now twice he tried To wound the King, svho leaped his steed aside, Then sternly svaits him as he springs again, And drives his bitiug falchion to the brain. The knights his tusks and mighty bulk admire, And eyes, yet red with half extinguish'd fire. Delighted now they viesv th' inviting scene ; Close girt svith jealous shades a fairy green, 510 SOL. U. F
A shadowy lawn, which tender hearts might chuse For amorous speech, or bards that court the Muse ; For ne'er by confluent streams, or lake, or grot, Did fabled Naiad hallow lovelier spot. A fountain, bursting from the earth, became A lucid pool, and fed a murmuring stream ; Its emerald verge a thousand blossoms dyed, And azure lilies gem'd the crystal tide. A sycamore, tbe patriarch of the glade, O'er the clear spring his ample foliage spread ; 520 Behind, amid the olive's darker green, Gleam'd the blue fig, the ruddy grape was seen. Soon o'er the Monarch's eyes soft torpor creeps, And by the ţvaters lull'd young Albert sleeps ; But lovelorn Pardo mark'd the moon on high, A thread of silver in the midday sky. (i Fair planet, never lover watch'd in vain Thy ssvelling orb, as I thy lingering луапе ! Ssvift through thy sphere of νίβΛνΙβδε crystal roll, Auspicious Cynthia ! to thy western goal, 530 And veil the stars in darkness, Λνηεη I svait The midnight hour by Sion's Golden Gate." Then in bright wreath his nimble fingers svove The jasmine, sacred to Amina's love.
" Sweetflower/'hesigh'd, " thy freshness shallnot fade Ere these glad eyes behold the blushing maid '," And as more thick a lover's day-dreams throng, His buoyant fancy prompts the minstrel song. " Oh sing not of love with his bended bow, And the silver fillet that binds his brow, 540 And his fluttering plumes behind j For the love thai wounds is a smiling pest, The love that has wings is a treacherous guest, And worthless the love that is blind. " No ! love is a frank and a brave cavalier, His saddle is jasper, of gold is his spear, And his armour the diamond bright : Mirth dips his gay mantle in rainbow dyes, His cheeks are the bud of the rose, and his eyes Are the stars ou a moonless night. 550 ťí Sweet Modesty comes, as his blooming bride, The bride-maiden, Mercy, attends at her side, And Loyalty rides as his squire ; The roses spring up at his palfrey's tread, And the woodbine blossoms around his head, To the songs of the feathery quire."— к 2
He ceased— do sportive fairies haunt the glade ?— Or does he clasp his osvn Arabian maid ? Trembling and breathless, both with haste and fear, Drawn by the sound, yet dreading danger near, 560 She came,—then screaming in her wild delight, Darts like a sunbeam to th' enraptured knight. Now melts in tears of extasy, and now An angry father sees in every bough ; Scarce can she trust her dream of bliss, or tell The chance that guided to that leafy dell. Oh ! from that hour, that wretched, rapturous night Of Acre's capture, and her hasty flight, Her thoughts still linger'd on one sacred spot, And him once seen, but never more forgot ; 570 Her only solace, svhen Almanzor blest The cares, the silver voice that lull'd to rest, Or Philomel in sympathetic strain To Eve's pale star deplored a love as vain. With grief her sire beheld his drooping flower, And bade Moheddin speed the nuptial hour. Each drop that o'er her faded beauty stole But fix'd the fatal purpose of his soul, " No more," he cried, <( this childish coldness shew, Nor feign disgust for one thou cans't not know ; 580
Soon shall his fondness dry these tears, and move E'en thy young heart to feel the power of love." Alas ! too well the power Amina knew That robb'd her cheek of youth's celestial hue, And made those lips that mock'd the aloe's bloom, Or breath'd the blushing Amra's mild perfume Pale as the lily, " ah !" she thought, u how vain The tardy blessing, should we meet again ! My heart would but a deeper grief deplore When these changed features should be loved no more. But hark !"—4was mellow evening's stillest hour When the soft Vina ounded near her bower, (That bower which eastward from the Town of God Look'd out where Kedron's winter torrent flow'd, Where silver Silöe bubbles into light, And dusky olives clothe the farther height ;) And soou a plaintive song attention moved, For sweet the strain, though not the voice beloved :— (i The Bulbul sings in the distant bower, Far, far from his Rose's anxious ear ; 600 But the Zephyr may waft to the drooping flower The sigh of the heart that she holds most dear. ν 3
" And hid in this garland of mystic bloom, She may feel the breath of that sacred sigh ; In the scentless amaranth's rich perfume, In the pale acacia's deepening dye. " Let it fan the blush on her faded cheek, Till it glow as though her lover svere near ; For even this silent wreath may speak The wish of bis soul io a faithful ear." 610 A svakeful eunuch heard the closing strain, And sought the venturous youth, but sought in vain ; While the sweet maid, no longer languid, pale, Snatch'd the blest wreath that told so sweet a tale. But Aladin to Asia's lord declares Fierce Richard's menace ; Sólyma prepares For instant siege, and deep in Sharon's shade Almanzor's care secludes the timorous maid, Where murmuring streams, and birds, and fragrant flowers, Erst join'd svith youth to chase her careless hours.— But ah ! that loved retreat is svrapp'd in gloom, The birds have lost their voice, the flosvers their bloom ;
And she whose lips responsive music breathed, Or in gay knots their fleeting glories wreathed, Sits pale beneath her favourite tree, and flings Her hands, scarce conscious, o'er the gilded strings Of her soft lute ; now wakes a plaintive strain, Nosv drops it from her hand, and weeps again. The past is like a vision of delight, For ever lost, the future veil'd in night. 630 But Saladine, who held Moheddin dear, With myrtle svreaths svould bind the brosvs of svar ; To Lidda's camp he nosv the maid invites, And speeds svith courtly pomp the bridal rites. In mirth and pomp Almanzor's household vied, And all were joyful, save the wretched bride. Passive, amid her maiden slaves she stands. While the red hinna stains her snowy hands, While svith rich gems they deck her ankles fair, And braid svith orient pearl her glossy hair ; 640 Then in a gay and gilded palanquin, \ Whose gaudy splendour mocks the grief svithin, ч They place their victim, and the march begin. J But as, to svile the sultry noon, they staid Their sveary steeds in Sharon's deepest shade, f 4
While all around her careless guardians slept, From her soft couch the timid virgin crept ; The roughest path, the wildest brake she chose, Anxious alone, when death should end her woes, To perish faithful—or perchance to move 650 Some wandering knight to guide her to her love. Such was her story,—but till poet's art Can paint the joy that shone in either heart ; Her silver tone, the inexpressive grace That lit her dark blue eyes, and glowing face ; 111 may he teach what made that hour ьо dear, Or that slight tale so sweet to Pardo's ear. But never on affection's stream, in sooth, Long smiles the sun, or is itb channel smooth.* The sable Lyard, Richard's favourite steed, 660 With one bold effort from his bridle freed, Bounds through the glade, while Pardo strives in vain To rush before and catch the broken rein : Still as he came the wayward horse was gone, Yet such slight space as lured the warrior on ; Nor marked he, till again he soothed its pride, How far it led him from Amina's side.
Bewilder'd now, and by his haste betray'd, He wanders farther from the anxious maid. " Thou sable beast," th' impatient lover cried, 670 Λ " Scarce are thy pranks by Moslem fears belied, > Which swear some demon fills thy dusky hide ! j Yc£ poor the sport, all vicious as thou art, To syring with grief a true and tender heart." The daylight sunk—in vain he look'd on high, And curs'd, what late be svish'd, the moonless sky -, Bewilder'd, wearied, till the morning shone On the new walls of distant Ascalon. Revived by hope, he spurs his steed, but there All was confusion, terror and despair ; 680 Pale every cheek ; one single thought opprest And still'd the svarring crosvd of every breast ; And soon he hears a dreadful tale, that drove Even from a lover's heart the dream of love ; In one sad tone, one mournful phrase they spoke, (( Their Mouarch captive to the Soldan's yoke." Th' assembled Peers in dismal conclave sate, How best to bear, and how reverse his fate $ Their minds benumb'd, partake the general gloom, A thousand plans propose, reject, resume; 690
Even heroes scarce were men ; when needed most, Courage, and hope, and sense itself seem'd lost.— But hark ! a shout—they see a knightly train, As captives long deplored, or wept as slain ,* The matted locks, the pale and wrinkled brow Spoke suffering past, but all was rapture now ; And happy Albert from the grateful ring Bounds in his transport, and demands the King. " Hast thou not heard,"the mournful Raymond said,”How in his slumber to the foe betray'd—" 700 " Nay ! my loved friend, no Moslem chains confine The Lion Heart, the captive lot was mine ! With sylvan sport and noontide heat opprest, A gurgling fountain lull'd the King to rest ; I slumber'd near, when from a happy dream I started, waken'd by a woman's scream, And saw a maid, who wept with anguish wild As stern Almanzor claim'd his truant child. Large was the hostile band, too large for strife, The pressing danger threaten'd Richard's life, 7Ю (For well I knew, by honour unreprest, What deadly hatred fired the Arab's breast ;) And boldly rushing 'mid the armed ring, ( Preserve my life !' I cried, ' preserve the King!' 2
Nor fail'd the fraud,—though all in battle field Had known his broomy crest and lion shield, The peaceful garb deceived ; the valleys rung With shouts of rapture as we pac'd along, And oft my secret fancy wander'd here To paint your fears, and joy that vanquish'd fear. 720 Yon woods may still the wandering King detain, But England's glory wears no Moslem chain." te Alas !" said Raymond, “'twere a happier doom ; Some beast may tear him now, or gulf entomb."— " Peace, Raven S croak not yet," young Pardo cried " Hope is a fairer and a safer guide. 'Tis madness thus th' inflicted grief to swell ;—■ But speak, dear Albert, how thy fetters fell ?" " Nor were the tale of pleasing interest void In happier hour," the gentle youth replied. /30 " They led me to the Soldan : nor his eye Flash'd with the meteors of intemperate joy, Nor glared with rage, when, as the truth I shew'd, His baffled satraps clamour' d for my blood. ( That King must ill a Sovereign's duty know Who harms the loyal, though he serve a foe,' He answer'd mild ; ' such zeal in half my train Had made thy Monarch's bold invasion vain,
Yet not too lightly must such knight be freec — Twice fifty thousand bysants bc the meed.' 740 " With grief I heard, beyond a subject's power, My ransom rated at a princely dower. When now the Soldan smiling led me forth, ' Nor mourn,' he said, { this tribute to thy worth ; The Christian warriors, when they hear thy plight, Shall vie with gifts to ransom such a Knight : And trust me, though a different faith be mine, I hold the name of chivalry divine ; Too well, in sooth, its foes are taught to prize What такеь frail man so glorious and so wise. 750 Fain would my soul th' ennobling precepts hear, And fain my limbs the sacred tokens wear.' " Amazed I ponder'd—could the holy flame Descend to warm a misbelieving frame ? " c Believe,' he cried, l with no impure desires To join your Order Saladine aspires, Nor were its glory tarnish'd, should a part' 1 Of its pure doctrines reach an Arab's heart.' i£ So modest ! thought I—could I stiil forbear ? I waived the vigil, waived the rites of prayer : 760 But in the bath his hardy limbs I laved,' Symbol of man by vows baptismal saved ;
Then at my will a simple couch he prest In sleep, the emblem of our mortal rest, And rose regenerate—o'er him next I threw The linen robe of truth's unspotted hue, That asks as pure a frame ; the scarlet vest That claims devotion from the constant breast, Danger and death for knighthood's sake to brave, And loath dishonour far beyond the grave. 770 Then passings by his rank imperial sway'd, Th' accustom'd blow, the friendly accolade, I bade him guard a soul from falsehood clear, And more than wealth or power the truth revere ; With liberal heart enjoy what heaven should send, Observe the holy rites the church ordain'd, And still be prompt, by selfish views uusway'd, His life or limbs to risk in beauty's aid ; For ill that wretch the name of Knight may bear Whose callous heart is closed to woman's prayer. 780 ce ' No more I muse/ th' attentive Soldun cries, f For from such source can less than heroes rise ? And let me prove I bear no heedless mind— Go ! seek the gold from all of Christian kind ; But if two summers past thou suest in vain, My power unwilling claims its thrall again.'
" I knelt my thanks :—yet ere I journey hence, I here my suit at knighthood's feet commence ; Largesse ! Largesse !—from thee so wise and bold, I ask a portion of the Soldan's gold ! 790 " 4 Who trusts in Saladine shall never find That trust betray'd,' the new-made Knight rejoin'd ; e I like thy suit—deem half thy ramsom told, And ten brave warriors that my dungeons hold, There lingering since Tabaria's fatal fight, By thee restored to liberty and light.' ' f He spoke, and leading past the ample gate, In solemn council where his Emirs sate, From all around, to loose my captive chain, He craved their bounty, nor he craved in vain. 800 Seiffeddin and his son with prompt accord, And Egypt's King, and Sindjar's valiant Lord ; Young Afdhal, worthy shoot of Ayoub's race, And bold Zeineddin, fair Arbelia's grace, Vied in their gifts ; alone Almanzor frown'd— When thus the Chief for ^sanguine arms renown'd :* ' Warrior, this gem is thine, but know that He Thy fraud preservad had found no grace from me ;
Say that the Soldan's camp is rich svith one, Whose wrongs, whose hatred seek his life alone ; 810 Nor care I, though the haughty boast display The Western lineage that my lips betray.' íť Wondering I heard, for strange it seem'd to find Such rooted hatred in a stripling's mind ; Whose form and beardless cheek seem'd fitter far For lady's service than the toils of svar. " Nosv all had given, but of the mighty debt Tsvelve thousand bysants svere uncounted yet ; When from his stores the Soldan these demands, And gis r es the treasure to my wondering hands. 820 i Receive this pledge of just esteem,' he cried, May still the lasss you teach your actions guide ; And still your garners every blessing hold. As you, svhen I reclaim, shall pay the Soldan's gold.' " Thrice happy gold ! too long in bonds opprest, The Monarch's gift svhat captive pilgrims blest ! I claim'd my steed, and hasten'd to depart, With lighten'd hands, but svith a lighter heart ; My fate, my safety, eager to declare To those, I knesv, svho held that safety dear, 830 Nor thought, alas ! svhat hopeless grief svas here."
iC Not so ! till we have trodden every glade, In yon ill-omen'd forest," Pardo said. " We might have known, from Arsouf t> dreadful eve, What demons there the bpells of horror weave. Yet bless me, Prelate ! and лл ith heaven my guide, Through all its glens undaunted will I ride ; Bring back my living Liege, or find my rest On the cold sod hi princely limbs have preist." Her sorrows shrouded in her ample veil, 840 The anxious Queen had heard tbe w arrior's tale ; But yesterday, to treacherous: ease betray'd, By the cool breezes and the fragrant shade, She linger'd, while her maidens sporting round, Spread tbe light banquet on the mo«sy ground. Her gay guitar th' Iberian virgin strung, And to her uprightly songs tbe forest rung ;— There Lusignan beneath the conscious shade Told his soft story to the captive maid : {( How blest луеге h^, would Cyprus Princes^ deign To share her ju^t, hereditary reign." Her glowing cheeks moist eyes, and heaving breast Emotions strong as love awakes confest ; Th' enamour'd King in breathless rapture gazed, But soon she crush'd the hopes her silence rais'd :
" Ah no !" she sigh'd, ci the fates have fix'd my doom, A lonely heart, a convent's pious gloom."— She spoke, and wandering sought the thickest shade, Till sober twilight sadden'd every glade. iC Alas !" she thought, " while yet a reckless child, 860 How oft have I at Cypriot maidens smil'd, When gathering flowers, that, bathed in mystic dew, Should kindle love, or bind their lovers true. Officious memory marks their bloom too well, But honour, duty, bid me shun the spell ; Yet there arc plants ivhieh, cull'd in twilight hour, O'er love unblest assert a holy power."— Alas ! how weak against Maimoune's guile All the soft magic of her amorous isle ! Not her's imagination's love-sick dream, 8Г0 Which fancy wakes and fancied balm can tame. Yet might she bless the idle search that now "4 Had spared her wounded breast a heavier blow, > And led her distant from the scene of woe ; y When on the breezes borne, the billows roll'd, The Moslem shouts their fancied capture told. As maid*., that dancing in the blossom'd mead, Hear the deep thunder pealing o'er their head,— voi.. II. (,
As mariners, when svinds with sullen moan Portend the storm, that find their rudder gone,— 880 So fared the Christian host ; even bearded men, That oft had fronted death, were children then. In tears the mild Matilda melts asvay, And lost in stupor Berengaria lay j Not soon her flowing sorrosvs gave relief, Or her firm spirit rose to strive with grief. The hope that long on Albert's words reposed, Died in her bosom, ere his story closed ; f n silence nosv she turn'd her to depart, New cause of anguish smothering at her heart, 890 When Bertrand loud in scoffing accents spoke (For Richard's loss his gloomy rapture woke :) " Ye, who beguil'd the hours in yonder shade, May tell perchance where pale Evanthe stray'd, And what soft scenes conceal the pensive maidj Or they ssdio mark'd how oft her faded cheeks Glow like the morn, when royal England speaks, May bid our hearts from idle fears be freed, And guess the riddle she alone can read ?" Impetuous anger blazed in Raymond's eye, 900 And Lusignan prepared the warm reply j
But Berengaria's glance reproachful stole To the dark depths of Bertrand's sullen soul. " And were it thus," the Queen indignant cried, (t What fiend is he that tells it to his bride ! Alas ! sweet maid, too much my wretched lot Usurp'd my soul; her absence was forgot. It wakens hope—with joy her loss I learn May she svith Richard stray, with him return; For know, base slanderer, wheresoe'er they ride, 910 Heaven is their guard, and honour is their guide." With hasty steps the noble dame withdrew, And baffled Bertrand shrunk abash'd from view.,END OF BOOK X.,g 2

ARGUMENT.,THE PRINCE OF THE ASSASSINS. Pardo determines to explore the wood, and takes leave of Albert—The forest fountain — The deserted man¬ sion — His journey through the desert — The snowy mountains — The cavern in the rock — Appearance and story of Hassan — His early friendship and quarrel with Nizam — His mysterious power — The temptation of Pardo—The paradise of Hassan— Pardo and Maimoune.
CŒUR DE LION.,BOOK XI.,THE PRINCE OF THE ASSASSINS. Pardo meanssrhile, in lighter mail array'd, Prepares од foot to tempt the dangerous shade. But first he calls his gallant friend apart, And thus relieves his agonizing heart : " I would not, Albert, that our comrades fear I too am lost ; ye know not hosv or svhere, But do not ask my venturous quest to share. I brought the sorross r , let me brave the pain ;— Nay start not, conscience shall not speak in vain. g 4
Fool that I was ! absorb'd in selfish joy ; 10 For Lyard heard, and warn'd of danger nigh. But thou wilt laugh, my friend, and while I speak Shame well may redden on my burning cheek, That I, who scorn'd tlie wanton archer's power, Lost my proud freedom in one luckless hour ; That many a night, for fair Amina's sake, My heavy eyes have learn'd like thine to wake ; Well mayst thou taunt me, none so well as thou— But check those smiles, I cannot bear them now ; In happier hours, should happier hours befall, 20 Pour forth thy gibes, and I will bless them all. " Farewell ! if now my eager search be vain, And I am lost, in heaven we meet again j But should my King, my more than sire return, To hear my wandering doom, perchance to mourn, Say, if his erring favourite still be dear, 'Twas my last hope that pious hands might rear A simple pillar by yon forest side, To mark for Richard's love that Pardo died.— Oh ! had I bled to guard his precious days, 30 Or shared thy danger, Albert ! and thy praise ! ci Still with one anxious wish my heart is fraught— My steed—-yet *twas not of my steed I thought ;
í know that thou the faithful beast wilt take, And prize my noble roan for Pardo' s sake. But she, Almanzor's child—Oh ! while I vow My days to Richard, peril waits her now ! I dare not think—but if impell'd by fear She seek this camp, and one no longer here, On thee, my generous Albert, I depend ; 40 Receive, protect her,—be indeed my friend. Once more farewell—nay give one smile to bless My venturous way, bright omen of success."— And is he gone ? Hc sprung upon his quest, As though his haste might give his feelings rest, And thought, with all her torturing train, depart, Lik e the pale phantoms at the dreamer's start. But though the sun in morning splendour glow'd, To him dark horror wraps the hateful wood ; Ah, that those hills, those conscious shades would tell At least the fate of him he lov'd so well. His anxious eye in vain he glanc'd around, Or on his horn the well-known summons wound ; Tis but the fawn that from his presence flies, 'Tis but the echo to his call replies.
At length (for oft through devious paths he stray'd) With sveary steps he reach'd the fatal glade ; As sweet a fragrance fills the balmy air, As cool the fountain seems, the fruits as fair ; And the soft spirit of departed joys 60 Breathes from each flosver, and ssvims before his eyes. What froze his glance ?—a scarf distain'd with gore ! A scarf! just Heaven ! that late Evanthe wore. (< Oh ! then were Bertrand's base suspicions true ! And луЬа1 dread tale is in that sanguine hue ? Yet ever be the hateful lie abhorr'd, Think, Pardo, think more nobly of thy Lord ; And emulate his Consort's trust, to prove Thy heart, like hers, deserves a hero's love. And for that stain, behold svhere all around 70 The slaughter'd boar has died th' enamelľd ground ; I will not fear—no not till proof be found. Be hope my guide, and lo ! those flosvers betray The tread of steeds—sweet seraph, lead the way !"■ Scarcely he stays to lave his burning brow, Or pluck the purple clusters from tbe bough ; And fresh as at the earliest hour of morn Onward he hastes, and winds his mellow horn.
But daylight fades,—he ill may brook delay, Yet fears again in tangled wilds to stray ; 80 Nor dares he slumber on the mossy green, Lest wolves assail, or scorpions wound unseen. " I love," hc thought, " a soldier's death to brave, But would not wish a lion's paunch my grave, Or court an aspic's bite—perchance 'twere best To make yon sycamore my eagle's nest, Though snake perchance, or vulture harbour there, Fearless I trust our common parent's care." Up the broad trunk svith agile grace he wound, To the tough boughs his ample mantle bound, 90 And slept ;—unnoticed sung the bird of night, Nor e'en Amina charms his dreaming sight. What odours from a thousand glosving flois'ers, Fair as the bloom of Irem's fabled boss-ers! 8 What strains from birds all glorious to behold, With svings of purple, emerald and gold, All strange to Europe's niggard summers, borne Round the young sleeper, speak th' awakening morn- Again the wood his hasty meal supplied, Again his steps the frequent footprints guide ; 100 Here stately trees obstruct the cheerful day, Here time-bosv'd veterans bar the sveary svay ;
Here rocks arise or narrow lasvns are spread, Here tangled brushwood closes all tbe shade. And now he reached a stream ; through narrow space Tbc sunbeams break upon its crystal face ; Th' acacia svith it* tufts of golden hair, h And taller trees, and flowers more fresh and fair Hang o'er its svaves, to view their image there; Save ss'here the lotos, as in wanton pride, 110 Spreads her broad leaves, and veils the lucid tide. Scarce mark'd the svanderer that the forest gresv Thin and more thin, and nosv retired from viesv ; For still, to screen him from the noontide beam, A belt of verdure clothed the svinding stream. Till now a moss-grown arch contracts the wave, In darkness chafing through the echoing cave ; And by a wall svhere clustering ivy twined, Still veiled in wood, the devious path declined. It reach'd a narrow gate ; the iron pin 120 Yields to the warrior's hand,—he ventures in. It svas a garden, such as Arabs love, Half art, half nature, wilderness and grove. Myrtle and orange here, and cassia grows, The dusky olive, and the glosving rose ,
Here the lost stream, iu mazy channels led, Cools the hot breeze, and visits every shade ; The thick-svove foliage of the laurel bower, And the pale star of sad Amina's flosver. But all was lonely, not a living sound— 130 And nosv he ventures on forbidden ground ; The Haram svalls, as infant, maid, or wife, Where Moslem beauty svastes her captive life. 'Tss as not the thought that death might wait him there, That svith a strange oppression loads the air ; That stole its freshness from each fount that falls In diamond shosvers svi thin the glittering halls, Where eastern luxury all her pride displays, In many a lamp of gold and sculptured vase, Or made the gay kitarr and amorous lute, 140 E'en to a lover's active fancy, mute. The bath, svhose svasses a costly scent diffuse, And shine o'er marble of a thousand hues ; Where roseate curtains shed voluptuous light, And silken seats the sveary limbs iuvite ; Charm'd not the svarrior's free-born sense, nor stole One softer feeling through his kindling -oul. tc No !" he exclaim'd, " a purer stream T quaffd, This Circe's cup has poison in the draught ;
The bird within its gilded cage may sing, 150 That never knew through azure fields to spring ; Ana oeauty may be idly happy here Nor dream that heaven had wilľd a higher sphere ; That she has sweeter duties, nobler powers, Or soul more lasting than those birds and flowers. And yet I love an Arab maid !—but why? Because her spirit sparkles in her eye, And inborn greatness lifts her far above These idle triflings that her sisters love." Swift through the gloomy passages he ran, 160 That join the Haram to the halls of man. d But could a despot's lone abode impart A sense more grateful to a Christian's heart, Without one spell the hateful truth to hide, They spoke of rapine, cruelty and pride. The cells where many a wretched, hopeless slave Toils, bleeds, and sinks unpitied to the grave ; The long divan in Persian silks array'd, The curtain'd galleries round the chamber spread, Or those beneath, where day shall never come, 170 "\ Where martial spoils are shrouded in the gloom, ч Or murder hides the victim and the tomb ;« \
Shuddering he saw ; but all was lonely there, And forth he rush'd to breathe a freer air. He reached the court, where still in Arab state, Chain'd by the foot, two harness'd coursers wait.* One dark as stormy clouds or wintry night, One as the lily's spotless blossom, white. " Wide is the plain, and hot the noontide ray, No branches now will check a horseman's way ; 180 Fortune, 1 take thy proffer'd gift—Oh ! speed My anxious wandering, as thou send'st the steed ;— For thee, thou raven beast, my cause is slight To love thy dusky hue,—I choose the white." But Httle use he found of spur or rein, For like an arrow glancing o'er the plain, As with his freedom pleas'd, th' unfetter'd steed Holds on his course with more than mortal speed. Soon has he left each cultured scene behind, He skims the sand, he snuffs the desert wind ; 190 Bounds where th* enduring camel moves with pain, And the red waves are like the stormy main. The warrior faints beneath the noontide heat, 'Gainst the hot casque his painful temples beat,
Yet o'er tbe waste, with unabating force, The wondrous courser holds hîs arrowy course. At last, 'twas at the sunset hour, he staid Where fruitful palms a desert fountain shade ; And cooler gales its belt of herbage fann'd, A verdant island in that sea of sand. 200 With joy the wanderer quits his wilful guide, Culls the ripe dates, and drinks the cooling tide, And slept—till with the morn beside him stood The wond'rous horse, and seem'd to court his load. ťí Methinks, if once from this waste region freed, The sluggish ass shall be my battle steed ; I well deserve to lunar wilds to soar, If, black or white, I trust in palfrey more í Who knows the treason should the traitor fly,— But sands surround me I must mount or die." 210 Thus still the Knight o'er desert realms was borne, While swelling Cynthia fill'd her silver horn ; Nor man he saw, nor aught of living kind, Save the vast ostrich, running with the wind ; Or the swift pelican, that flies to bring Her nestlings water from the distant spring, While still the courser stopp'd, as evening fell, Where clustering palm trees shade the lonely well,
And welcome sleep the wanderer's strength renew'd, The spring his beverage, and the date his food. 220 At length more wild the barren region grows, Near the hot desert snow-crown'd mountains rose ; The dews fell thick, the evening gale blew chill, As rush'd the steed up many a rugged hill. Each glen seem'd ruder, keener every blast, And each steep ridge was loftier than the last. And now he reach'd a height—one well might deem The moon shed coldness in her piercing beam, On naked peaks and brows for ever white, And azure glaciers, glittering in the light. 230 But still by many a torrent's dangerous edge, By many a precipice, whose slippery ledge The mule might fear, with unabated speed, And surer footing bounds th' unwearied steed. From a broad arch of undissolving snow A rushing torrent sought the dell below ; Undazzled by the foam, or glittering light Of pendant ice that fringed that vault of white, The steed plunged in, where not a straggling beam Shew'd the dark cradle of the roaring stream. 240 Onward he holds, nor heeds the dashing spray, Nor fails his footing on that darfgerous way ; vol. и. и
Tbc dread abyss might seem the path of hell, Till opening on a rock-encircled dell, Whose smooth ¡steep ^klesshako olì the feathtrv якт And shut the moonbeams from the depth below ; Save where one fallen peak svith ruin stresv'd The rocky bottom, fragments vast and rude ; And, through the chasm, one silver ray svat> fluiur, Whei e on the adverse wall a bugle hung. 250 Its ample round the youth w ith music filte, And svakes the echoes of a thousand hills ; When lo ! the flinty barrier rolls away, And unseen doors a lamp-lit cave display. t4 Almighty Power ! what nosv thy will 5 " he cried, But be thou yet my guardian and my guide," He quits bis steed, which started off agen, Drasvs his bright sword, and plunges in the den. Again the valves have closed, the walls repeat Nought save the echoes of his rapid feet ; 260 Shesv nought but rocks with tasvny moss o'ergrosvn, Or where the snoss r > damps filter through the stone ; The half-froze drop that caught the flickering light, White clustering spar, and pendant stalactite. " Oft have I heard, in Arab story told, Hosv scaly dragons guard the cavern'd gold,

Its lustre fell upon a plain divan, 280 Where ¡sate m robes of svinte an aged man. Nor joy nor fear his changeless check exprcit, To daunt or welcome hb astonibh'd guest, While pointing to the coarse ι epast that spread Th' untap'stried floor, in tianquil tone he said: ' ť Hail, Christian t thou art late—advance and eat, Hunger like thine should make the banquet ssveet ; — Nay , pause not—svairiois are not nicely fed, Nor need voluptuous, and 'tis wholesome bread ' h S
ťí Nay, father ! who art thou, by seeming spell That waiťst me here, and know'bt that need so svell?" " Hassan, the Mountain Prince !" " Ah ! then toj late," The youth exclaim'd, <c I know my dreadful fate, For thou hast murder's deadliest arts, to strike The distant victim and tlie near, alike ; Once mark'd by thee, the tyger knows his prey, Or svasted wretches pine their lives asvay. One only boon, Assassin Chief ! accord, Thy poisons spare, and kill me with the sss'ord." No feeling o'er his furrow'd visage past, 300 And cold and rayless was the glance he cast. " Trust me, young Knight ! thou hast no cause of fear, For murder svherefore should I bring thee here ? It had been easier far to bid thee fall While lingering in Almanzor's lonely hall, Or by the forest fountain—foolish boy ! My svish is now to save thee, not destroy." " Then in the name of heaven I eat," he said, " For He who walked the printless svaves, and fed Thousands with less than this ; whose posver divine Lives in the sacred wafer (mystic sign !)
Shall sanctify the meal."—Yet oft he gazed On that old man, and still the more amazed. The winters of that desert realm had shed Their whitest snows upon his aged head ; The rose his pallid cheek might once have known, The modulation of his youthful tone, The lustre of his changeless eye were flown. Fix'd as th' uncofSn'd dead, or those that, lost In Alpine regions, feel the grasp of frost ; 320 Yet not the kindly calm of pious sage, Nor wrinkles those of meek and reverend age : Though anger sate not on his brow, nor trace Of evil passions darken'd on his face, It was an apathy that told of sin, And seem'd to speak the silent heart within Cold as the glaciers, that but melt to shew The dark abyss or flinty rock below; Nor spoke it false, who knew his youth might know. Health shed her beam on Hassan's vernal hours, And pleasure woo'd him to her tempting bowers ; Glanced in each mountain damsel's laughing eye, As like the fleet gazelle she bounded by, And breathed voluptuous in each scented gale That swept the flowers of Casbin's fairest vale. u 3
So cool the fc mtaius, and the banks so green, Such tranquil beauty clothed the smiling scene, The parted soul might wish its Eden there, Or Peries for their odorous feast repair: Behind, Elburza's rugged chain arose, 340 High o'er tlie cloud?, a *vilderness of snows. But smiling beauty Λνοη not Hassan's love, The stream soft murmuring, nor the shadowy grove. Nor yet to see those glittering peaks arise, Fair as fond fancy pictures distant joys ; Oft луопк! he break the charm that distance shed, And plant on horrid heights his venturous tread; Nature he loved, but in her wildest form,— The raging sea, the earthquake, and the storm. He fled from Shiraz' palace-groves, afar 350 'Mid the lone halls of column'd Istakar, To tread her ruin'd terraces, and gaze On the cold moon, or Naptha's fitful blaze ; And think upon those wretches that below Move in one whirl of burning, endless woe. As yet young Hassan's heart was free from crime ; But trust him not, the tempter knows h' time— The sting of pain, or sorrow's wasting rage May cloud %vith froAvns the wrinkled brow of age ;
But trust not him svho, yet iu sunny youth, 360 Wants the frank smile, the open glow of truth ; Whose cold perverted fancy never roves To dream of faithful friends and happy loves, But rashly wanders in ambition's maze, That winds, and knots, and darkens as he strays. Not that ambition svhich for glory stakes Peace, health, and life, and gilds the wreck it makes ; But that svhich, mindful of the present hour, Stops not for crime, and grasps alone at posver. Yet Hassan had a friend, and one svhose mind 370 No bonds, save virtue'% eser yet confin'd ; His thought through nature's various realms svould range, Explore her wonders, ponder every change, And own in all that Being, svhose control Created, keeps, and renovates the whole ; Bids the same lasvs the small and great confine, Bids for one end discordant means combine ; One posver renew svhat other powers destroy, And clothes the whole in beauty and in joy. Oh ! hosv could darkness love the cheerful light, Or Nizam's smiles svith Hassan's gloom unite ? и 1
Perchance, that though of different race, they drew Milk from one breast, or through the morning dew Chaeed the fierce panther, or the rapid deer, Each, save his equal friend, without a peer. Perchance, that both insatiate in the draught, They from one fount the streams of science quaft'd/ Nizam would snatch the blossom from the shoot, And in its embryo trace the future fruit ; His friend would poison from the leaves distill, 390 And try on puny beasts its power to kill ; Honey from each the mind of Nizam stole, From each its venom flow'd to Hassan's soul. The Persian Sultan heard of Nizam's worth ; From Casbin's peaceful shades he calľd him forth, O'er all his realms his sole vicegerent made, Loved as himself, and like himself obey'd. But the young sage, though pomp and powerwerenew, To seek his friend from courtly scenes withdrew. He found him on a rock, intent to throw 400 His baits upon the stream that foam'd below, And while his panting victims round him lie, To wanton in their dying agony. " Up, Hassan—throw these childish sports aside, Seek nobler game, an empire's cares divide ;
Our bounteous Prophet," thus the youth began, " Showers on thy friend the smiles of Arselan. Come then to Shiraz—trust thy Nizam's care— My wealth, my power, my Sovereign's favour share." His moody friend scarce rais'd his sullen eyes, 410 And thus with proud and curling lip replies : " What should I share ?—think'st thou the gaudy gold That decks thy caftan and thy turban's fold Has charms for me?—that Hassan would resign His own free mountains for a fame like thine ? My simple robes exclude the heat as well, Thy pomp but makes them heavier.—Canst thou tell For thee if richer fruits adorn the tree, Or shines the sun with brighter light—for thee ?" " Dear Hassan, is it thus ? Hast thou forgot 420 Our youth, our vow to share one common lot ?* Art thou content ! has thine aspiring mind All its ambitious views at once resigned ?"— " No, fool ! Ambition still is Hassan's joy, I scorn thy proffer, for I look more high ;
He that is foremost when the race begins, May cheat the betting crowd, but seldom wins. 'Tis thou that never yet her fire hast nurs'd— The second in the realm, and not the first ! Thou lovest to hear the throngs that trumpet forth Thy mercy, justice, piety, and worth, (A thousand gifts that none discovered here, But heap them all upon their new Vizier j) Nor think'st those talents, now so lustrous grown, Would blaze with tenfold light beneath a crown. Thy master to thy grateful heart is dear ; Be kind, and send him to a happier sphere. Thou start'st—then, Nizam, we are friends no more : Thou would'st not dare to look where I will soar. Without one bright tomaun, one robe of state, 440 I'll fix my power beyond the reach of fate ; , High as the Simurgh's nest shall be my home, Where thou or Arselan can never come ; I'll stand erect upon a lofty wall, When he shall totter—thou perchance may'st fall." Vex'd at the drops that gather'd in his eyes, With hands uprais'd sad Nizam thus replies : " Eternal God ! is then the vision o'er ? Can Hassan speak it, we arc friends no more !
Ah, then farewell, clear streams and shadowy groves, And each dear witness of our early loves ; Like the sad flowers that waste their virgin bloom, The lamp that glimmers in the silent tomb, Ye speak of broken ties, of pleasure past, Bright as the rainbow, and to fade as fast." Years roll'd away, and Nizam still approved His wondrous worth, by king and people loved, Bokhara's farthest bounds their rule obey, And flowery Cashmere courts so mild a sway. But to the west, amid Elburza's snows, 460 A mountain chief to strange dominion rose. He had not wealth the sordid soul to move, Nor those free manners that the generous love, Nor could his dwelling youth or age invite, The strongest fortress of a desert height. Yet he had followers, eager to fulfil What they believed their God's dictated will j Nay, some declared that wondrous man had given To them a foretaste of his promised heaven ; And he who dared to doubt what they should tell, Or on his mind a strange conviction fell, Or murder struck him in his inmost cell. 3
Slaves trembled for their lives, and kings were prone By his alliance to secure their own. h Yes ! Hassan knew to луогк upon the soul, Till e'en instinctive conscience lost control. He knew each power that cuts the thread of life, What taint will enter with the venom'd knife ; What unobserv'd will present death procure, What saps the hardy frame, unmark'd, but sure. 480 The toad, the basilisk of dangerous glance, The snake, whose noise betrays his swift advance, The shining fly with wings of emerald light, The dog that maddens with its phrenzied bite ; Each weed that curses Afríc's sands, or grow T s By fens contagious, or on desert brows ; The sullen yew, the fatal manchineal, Or those blue flowers that sense and feeling steal )* And all those mineral poisons, deadlier still, That earth secretes, were subject to his will. 490 Nor these alone—at midnight he would dwell On those dark books that things forbidden tell,— The spells of numbers, and in baleful hour, How holiest names may have unholy power.
By Kaf, in the Domdaniel's caves accurst, At Istakar, beside the fires they nurst, He talk'd with those 'twere impious but to name ; At night on highest hills unhallow'd flame Blazed for his orgies, and the cloudless moon Withdrew her beam, though in her fullest noon. 500 But Arselan was gather'd to his sires, And his brave son, whom frequent conquest fires, From Omar's gulf to Oxus' frozen wave Convenes his force to crush the rebel slave. In vain—that Prince whom half the east obey'd, Was posverless here ; his army fear'd and fled. 1 His star grew dim, nor ever brighten'd more, For Nizam, bulwark of his giant posver, Fell from his favour in that fatal hour. Too late recalľd, while yet he rued the smart 510 Of courtly wrong, a dagger reach'd his heart. Lamented Sage ! svas this thy mournful end ? Did Hassan thus requite his early friend ? Sanjar, the Sultan, with a bolder train, Assaults Alhamout's rock-built fort in vain. Amid his guards, and in his tent of pride, The Ataghan svas planted by his side :
" Did not the Mountain Prince thy worth revere, Thy heart ss-erc softer than this marble here.'" 1 Such svas the Chief that sought the Christian yoke ; That Eudon and that Conrad dared provoke, And Saladine disdain'd, till Hassan sent Three midnight murderers to his inmost tent. Startled he svoke, and darkling baffled all, Till the rous'd menials hasten'd at his call. One wretch his arm had slain, a second fled, And headlong leap'd the lofty balustrade ; The last with poison'd weapon picrce'd his side, And gloried that in Hassan's cause he died. 1 Such man was he, if he indeed were man, 530 Whose wondrous life surpass'd our mortal span, Till he like Egypt's cavern'd dead became, Nor time had posver upon his wither'd frame- He sate in silence, and svith serpent gaze Watch'd the young Knight, whose cheek no dread betrays, ť< Chief, I have proved my trust ; requite it nosv. Why am I here ?"—In accents calm and slow- Grave Hassan spoke : " that all thy race may bc Won through thy teaching to my faith and mc."
íť Nay, Hassan í I am better skiiľd to bleed 540 In Hcaveu's pure cause, than reason on its creed ; And if its mysteries pass the mind of man, 111 may I read what prelates cannot scan. Prepare thy tortures,—Prince, I dare to die ! But never shall my recreant tongue deny My vows baptismal, or this sacred sign 4 Given but to Christians, knighthood's badge divine." > " If but to Christians, how to Saladine ?" * The Chief rejoin'd ; (i but be thou mute and hear : OT Like thee the One pure Being I revere ; 550 And He whose humble steps Judea trod, Inspired of Heaven, though misbelieved a God. Nay, start not—is this truth unheard before ? Do half your Christian sects confess him more?—- But not to Him alone my faith is given, For Islam's Prophet is the priest of Heaven. But nor Mahommed's creed, nor Christ's can svin Eternal joy, without that light svitimi, That faith—yea Christian thou account'st them blest, Who quit the svorld, upon some mountain crest 560 To tame their rebel flesh by fasts severe, Vigil, and prayer, and penitence austere."
4Í Aye, Mountain Chief, the anchorite sve prize, Yet holiest they," the ardent youth replies, " Who pure as hermits in their rock-hesvn cell, Have yet a sword to strike the infidel." ťť Forbear, rash Christian—curb thy venturous thought, Nor give me vantage farther than I sought, For such am I—for many a lonely year, Such svere my hours of abstinence and prayer ; 570 Till the cold moonbeams blanch'd my naked head, And from my brow the trace of passion fled ; Then dasvn'd upon my soul a heavenly light. By glimpses first, then purely, calmly bright. Thou deem'st me curst, that human victims bleed At my behest ; and doubly curst indeed Where I, if human passion bade their death : But Heaven's own oracles inspire my breath. I know the holy transport,—calm and still My humbled soul receives th' Eternal Will ; 580 Its chosen Avenger—yet my eyes grow dim, And nature shudders, till I think of Him Whose realm was ravaged by th' offended Lord, When human mercy check'd his conquering sword ; What praise was His, that with unmoisten'd eyes Led forth his Son, the destin'd sacrifice ;
How Judith's hand th' Assyrian's life-blood shed, How last, for man a Holier Victim bled."— " Pervert not thus," burst forth th' indignant youth, (i To ends accurst th' eternal Word of Truth.— 590 Vengeance is his ! or when to mortal given, Has stamp'd in blood the characters of Heaven. Its Will confined not to one narrow breast, The sun has paus'd to view, the world confest. But for a Holier Name—this den of death Would sink in ruin, if I gave it breath. Think of His life, thou fiend ! and think of thine ! If thou hast power, miscall it not divine." {i Misjudging youth ! nor at thy warmth I muse, Nor chafe to hear—I pity and excuse 600 The zeal I soon shall prize ; and give indeed, To win thy faith, what should have been its meed. My power, like that to zealous Peter given, To those I love unfolds the gates of heaven ; Living they enter, living to return, But ever, thirsting for that blest sojourn, They work my bidding, nor can pain annoy, Nor death appal—a death that leads to joy. Say ! if my spirits waft thee hence aloof, Wilt thou believe ? wilt thou abide the proof?" 610 VOL. ιι. ι
ci Chief! I am in thy posver," the Knight replied, "And well I guess that, were the proof denied, Unarm'd as now thou secm'st, thy lightest words Could fill these cups with death, this cave with swords. Yet, wizard ! practis'd as thou art, beware ; Clear be thy fountains and thine houris fair, And green thy shades—they has'e not to deceive One half-convinced in wishing to believe, But one who trusts in Heaven's sustaining power To pierce the spells of thy Circean bosver." 620 " Nay ! think not of deceit, or death, or fear, But share my cup, and know my love sincere." Th' Ismailian spoke, " and more, if doubt oppress, " Or weariness intrude, (though svell I guess Thy stay will seem too short, that bower too dear), One wish sincerely breath'd will waft thee here. I knosv thee, Pardo ! though not here display'd Thy leopard shield ; I know the hand that laid Thee, helpless babe, where monarchs past, nor guest That royal currents mingled in thy breast ; — 630 Nay, let not eager hope thy cheek inflame, \ The hour, rash youth, that tells thy princely name,p> Shall be an hour of torture and of shame. y
To prove my friendship, hear one wonder more,— Thy Monarch lives, but on a western shore." He spoke, and deep the grateful liquor quafTd, The knight in silence took, and pledged the draught, And sank, with deep and sudden trance opprest," Ere he could ask one blessing on his rest. Sure there are hours when gentle spirits keep 640 Their hallow'd vigils o'er our reckless sleep ; And e'en though dreams be hush'd, the conscious mind Awakes lo pleasure, nameless, undefined. Yet now less pure the subtle spell that stole A soft voluptuous thrill through Pardo's soul ; Or that sweet voice, whose mellow cadence seems To echo those that charm'd his rapturous dreams. ťť The dews of morning gem the flower, The morning gales refresh the bower, And grateful birds to Heaven prolong 650 The incense of their matin song ; Yet still their watch the Peries keep, To bless one earthly pilgrim's sleep. ι 2
ťí Awake thee, youth ! the moments fly, Too short will be thy dream of joy ; Earth claims thee back to woe again, Till Azraei burst thy mortal chain. Then wake, thy store of rapture reap, Nor лvaste one hour of Heaven in sleep." The knight in thought had vanquished all the joys Voluptuous Moslems hope in Paradise, But lo ! his sylphlike guard his breast alarms With no exuberance of obtruded charms ; Her braided hair, her starry circlet bright, Her zone, her vesture of embodied light, That changed through every hue—Oh ! could a form That aw'd assembled demons, fail to warm Such youth as his ? through his delighted soul, With every glance insidious passion stole, So calm, so pure, that nor his virtuous pride, 670 Nor e'en Amina's image, rose to chide ; Such love it seem'd as pious vestals feel For Saint or Angel watching o'er their weal. The pensive languor of Maimoune's eye, The breathing perfume of her gentle sigh,
Charm'd more than smiles by earthly beauty given, They look'd, they whisper'd of her native heaven. She led him forth, while still the duteous grove Bow'd o'er her head in reverence and in love.* She shakes ætherial odours from her hair, 680 Disdains the envious turf, and glides in air. (C And is this Heaven ? was ever, since the birth Of Sin and Death, such Paradise on earth ? Can all be true that bards reveaľd of yore, Armida'? garden, and Acrasia's bower ? Or of those starry halls where Peries wonn, Throned in the splendours of the evening sun ? Shadukiam's golden towers, for ever bright, And Amberabad, sublime in purple light ?"f A thousand fountains glitter'd in the beams, 690 A thousand flowers were imaged in the streams ; And trees unknown extended wide and high Their long arcades, a leafy panoply.,i'3
Th' unfading amaranth, with its gorgeous hue, The lotos, robed in empyrean blue, The rose, whose hundred leaves of beauty spread, Th' agave, rearing high its stately head ; Less fair by Pharphar's banks the flowers appear, Or Yemen's glens, or valleys of Cashmere, Not brighter green the groves of Shiraz clad, 7OO Less pure Choaspes' fount, or vaunted Roenabad. It were a joy to list the waters flow, Or watch them rippling o'er the stones below ; While fearless of the hook the fishes glide, Like living gems, and wanton in the tide ; And birds like those (as Moslem tales presume) * In which just spirits wait their day of doom, Wave their green plumage o'er each lucid rill, Soft music murmuring from the rosy bill. And for the fragrance, 'twas that sense refined, / M That breathes a sweet delirium through the mind ; That says a kindred spirit lingers nigh, And wakes the memory of forgotten joy.
And oh ! Maimoune's converse—ye who prove How trifles charm us from the lips Ave love, May guess what grace her look, her dulcet tone Lent to her speech, and made each theme her own ; How doubly sweet to him, who left but now Elburza's cliffs, and Hassan's awful brow. Nor lack'd there aught that fabling Suras tell 7^0 Of that blest garden where Believers dwell ; The crystal dew that falls in odorous showers, Cool streams of milk and wine, and pearly bowers ; And here were palaces, that shine and seem As they had caught the morning's violet beam, While seats of flowers unfading, undeprest, Surround the glittering halls and tempt to rest ; And banquets, such as kings in vain desire, Come with the wish, and at a wfch retire. ' f How fair," the youth exclaim'd, " how glorious this ! 730 Yet why fbr us alone such la\ ish bliss ?" (S Is yet thy sight so dim?" Mainionne said, And on his brow her rosy fingers laid ; (k See where on mossy banks my sisteis lie. And lap the Faithful in eternal joy." ι 1
He look'd again, aud radiant forms were seen In each cool grot, each shadowy walk of green, Beneath each trumpet-flower's gigantic bell, On each sweet tuft of golden asphodel; Their syiphic weight the docile peacocks bear, 740 They wanVon in the waves, they glide in air, With the light clouds they wheel in mazy dance, And rapture beams in each ætherial glance. Night comes not here; those dark and silent hours, When the warm sun no gladdening influence showers, Are gay with lamps, whose silver radiance falls In tenfold splendour from the crystal walls ; The founts that breathing coolness through the glade Beneath his beams in rainbow beauty play'd; Blush as he sets, with innate lustre bright /50 Send through the gloom their thousand jets of light. New glory gilds th' acacia's polish'd stems·', Its flowers are spangled with the dancing genib ; And as she sits beneath its feathery shade, A halo dances round Maimoune's head. E'en thus, beneath Magellan's southern skies, The ocean brightens as the daylight dies ; Ami half alarm'd the mariners admire Their oars, their vessel, bathed in liquid fire.
Here pleasure leads her joyous train along, 760 In one gay round of frolic, feast and song ; Fatigue and pain the happy region fly, And slumber sits not on th' unwearied eye. The youth, forgetful how he braved the spell, Whose soft oblivion proved its power too well, Nor doubting if those bowers of bliss had given All pious Christians hope and dream of heaven, If sad reflection once asserts her power, Looks in Maimoune's eye, and thinks no more.,END OF BOOK XI.

CŒUR DE LION.,BOOK XII.,THE PILGRIMAGE OF BERENGARIA. Three days are past—in vain is every glade Explored for Richard and the captive maid ; To all the saints are solemn vows addrest, Each soul is bow'd ; in many a haughty breast Wakes slumbering conscience ; crimes forgotten long Speak from their graves, andforceth' accusing tongue. Dire penance follows, vigil, fast, and prayer, A thousand pious frauds to cheat despair ; So may offended Heaven avert the stroke, And spare the judgment which those crimes provoke.
At length Evanthe came, but weak and pale, As flitting spectres in the twilight vale. She sought the council-hall, and fearful roll'd Her hollow eye, " Where, svhere b Leopold ?" " Ha!" thought her lover, " did he share her heart? " Know'st thou not, Princess, since sve sasv him part, The moon has svax'd and wan'd ? But dost thou bring No svords of hope, no tidings of the King?" cť The King !" she cried—' v Oh Heaven ! what dreadful light Breaks on the doubtful visions of the night ! 20 But, save for ill, could Austria linger here ?— Nay do not smile, I am not crazed by fear, Last night I saw the traitor—must I call The Lion Heart his victim or his thrall?" Chill horror reign'd, while each revolves too late His mutter'd threats and ill-dissembled hate. Yet how contrived ? such treason might demand A bolder genius and a firmer hand. The Queen approach'd, but soon Evanthe's tears, Chase her young smiles and waken darker fears ; 30 Silent she clasps her friend, her sorrosvs flosv In mournful prescience of th' unutter'd woe.
But she who seem'd as though her breaking heart Had ceas'd to beat, arises with a start : " I must not linger, or my strength will fail, Ere I can utter half the dreadful tale. ť Thatnight," (but here a blush her cheek o'erspread) " When from your side in yonder grove I stray'd, Heedless I wander'd, seeking many a flower In childhood cherish'd on my natal shore, 40 Till darkness gather'd round—I sought again My distant friends ;—I ran, I cail'd in vain ; And fear, that rous'd my cries, at length subdued, Fear of the savage beasts that haunt the svood. Nosv midnight came, but then í reach'd a dell, Where a cool fount in pleasing murmurs fell ; I drank the clear fresh wave, and almost blest The chance that gave so ssveet a place of rest. Day dasvn'd at last, the turf svas stain'd with gore, Nor svas the victim far, a mighty boar ; 50 The King perchance to this green spot had chased The lordly prey, abandon'd in his haste. Yet slosvly I the track of steeds pursued, "4 My steps were feeble, and the луау svas rude, > And daylight faded ere I left the svood. J
Blue misty hills the northern prospect crown'd, But where tbe ocean form'd a nearer bound White buildings rose; with all the little force I yet could summon, I renew'd my course. Alas ! too soon I found my hope betray'd ; 60 O'er turban'd domes the mournful cypress spread, A place of grief, a City of the Dead ; Vast as Larneca, svhere in endless line, On Cyprus' shore the marble fabrics shine.* My heart gresy sick—was this my destined home, E'en while I breathed, a tenant of the tomb ? Living to waste beside the wasting dead, No eye to mourn me, and no prayer to aid. Yet Fancy slept with all her idle gear Of gouies and goblins, childhood's favourite fear ; 70 Nor was my heart unnerv'd by conscious sin, I cail'd on Mary's name, and ventur'd in. Soft gleaming from a new-built tomb, a light Shone, like a friend amid the dismal night. The senseless clay луа8 sepulchred beneath, But o'er the bier, in all the pomp of death, The snow-svhite pall was spread ; soft odours came From virgin flowers, and lamps of silver frame From Saba's oils dispens'd a fragrant flame.
For here with every Jama's sacred morn, 80 To weep their friend the Moslem maids re'turn ; Renew the lamp, the votive svreath bestow, And feed with tears their unavailing woe, b " Alas ! like them, my tale prolongs the grief, Its lingering cannot change, I svill be brief.— 4i I know not if to lengthened toil a prey, Or that those odours stole my sense asvay, Entranced I sunk :—I saw, but all might seem Illusive shades, and past as in a dream. " Before the gate ray hand forgot to close, 90 O'ergrown with moss, a humbler fabric rose ; Two men approach'd :—the first in seeming dread Started and paus'd, but took me for the dead. How had I pray'd, svhile yet the prayer seem'd vain, To hear the sound of human voice again ! Christian or Moslem seem'd not then my care, So my last sighs were breath'd in human ear ; But svith the sight of armed men, a chill Crept o'er my heart, and terror held me still. Their hands unbarr'd the antique tomb, and led 100 A fctter'd captive from its asvfiil shade ; No ray reveaľd his face,—though dimly seen, His form svas noble and august his mien. vol. и. к
But as his jailor parting turn'd, I knew Tbe crest, the mail, the Cross of Austrian blue : I do not fable, as my soul would hold Its hope of heaven, that man was Leopold !— With haste that seem'd beyond my wasted frame I rose, pursued, implored him by his name : They heard me, Princes ! yet they did not heed, 110 Or, deaf to pity's claims, increas'd their speed ; Nor had I reach'd them, but the prisoner broke His chain, and levelľd with a vengeful stroke His other foe ; but soon a lawless throng Pour'd from the ship, and forced their prey along. " The last was springing through th' empurpled wave, ŕ Oh, aid a dying wanderer ! aid and save !' I cried :—he answer'd with a mournful sign, ' Hush thee, poor maid, or instant death is thine !' The galley saiľd, I sunk upon the sand ; 120 A glittering baldric lured my feeble hand,— Say, has my fancy coin'd one horror more, Or is this belt the belt that Richard wore ?" c Alas ! the Queen's convulsive start has shewn How well to her each fatal gem was known ;
While pale as hers each hardy cheek became, And only Bertrand's brow was flush'd with shame. " Was then that captive Richard ?" Albert cried ; " Such were not then my thoughts," the maid replied. fi I could not dream such guilt—but deem'd him come To seek some Moslem, prison'd in the tomb. Yet never, sure, had Richard heard the cry Of feeble wretch, and left her there to die !" " Alas !" said Lusignan, " thus faint and worn, What guardian saint has sped thy safe return ? " Strength fled with hope—this belt depress'd my mind With fearful bodings, dark but undefined. Hours past unheeded—for the sun was high Ere I again unclosed a conscious eye, Propt in a stranger's arms :—but alien tongue, HO Nor turban'd brow could wake my terrors long— T'was Aladin, who with the tenderest cares Revived my wasted strength, and sooth'd my fears. He gave me nectar from the wounded palm,* That bleeds by day in wine, by night in balm ;,it 2
Before him placed me on his Arab steed,— ' Bound to yon northern hills, the Soldan's need 111 brooks delay,' he cried, c yet would he fain That need should wait, ere woman sued in vain.' Each dingle of the tangled wood he knesv, 150 And, heedless of the weight, his courser flesv ; He bore me to the gate of Ascalon, Staid not my thanks, but like a dart was gone." cc Heroic youth !" cried Philip of Beauvais, (( Alas ! that Moslem should extort my praise." " Alas !" said Raymond, " that a prelate's mind Should harbour thought so earthly, so confined ! But mark that scowling Baron—while I speak, Mark each quick change on Bertrand's felon cheek ! And lurks not treachery there ?—in him who first 160 With Conrad's blood the godlike Prince aspers'd ? Nor deem'd it shame secluded speech to hold With Philip's bosom snake, and Leopold ! Chain'd though he be (and may an evil end Befall the traitors !) Richard has a friend." 4 He spoke, and Bertrand rose ;—his eye of fire Flash'd for a moment svith ungovern'd ire,— But soon a starting tear supprest the glow, And deepest sadness gather'd on his brosv.
" Raymond 1 proud Raymond! I thy taunts forgive : Yet none but thou should make such speech, and live. I hate the Monarch, nor my hate disguise, And he who fears not him, the world defies. ln youth, on whom could fairer fortunes shine ? What hopes so gay, what heart so light as mine ? Dear to Prince Henry, to his sister dear— Yes ! royal Helen smil'd on Bertrand's prayer. How firm my friendship, and how fond my love, To distant years my ardent lays shall prove. I hate not Richard for our early strife,— 180 A passing storm-cloud in the morn of life ; Nor that I bow'd beneath his matchless sword — e He, generous then, my life and lands restored ; But deepest vengeance, deadliest hate attends On smiling enemies, and faithless friends. Young Henry died,—my grief, that mock'd control, Drew love and pity from his father's soul ; f That fatal blow was dealt by heaven alone— The death-wound of my peace was Richard's own ! 'Twas he who fix'd on Helen's charms mine eyes, 190 And, pleased to see my fond emotions rise, Bade me so high my daring wishes raise, And taught my willing lyre to sound her praise ; к 3
Yet while svith treacherous hopes my flame he fann'd, The Saxon Duke svas graced with Helen's hand ! s What would I give, brave youth, to feel agen The boiling agony that tore me then ! With brow erect I met the shaft of fate, And made all Europe subject to my hate. Witness the ceaseless svars, the floods of gore, 200 From Ebro's stream to Brabant's eastern shore ; The strife whh Philip, oft svith pain subdued By Pope or Legate, and as oft renew'd. h The blood of thousands scarcely quench'd mine ire, Ob ! that their curses could relume the fire ! " Fame had no charms, and vengeance died at last, A deadlier calm succeeded to the blast ; My frozen heart nor love nor hate could warm, Grief had no sting, and pleasure lost its charm. The youthful wonder'd that my check was svan, 210 And shunn'd the silent, melancholy man ; Nor could the aged rest on me their cares, My woes could never sympathize with theirs. I fled svherever tumult held her reigu, For there alone I seem'd to breathe again ; And but where battle's fiercest fury glosv'd, My torpid blood svith healthful vigour flosv'd.
c£ Tsvelve tedious years my grief have soften'd nosv, And toil and pain have blanch'd a youthful brow, Yet from my heart one pang can never move— 220 The conscious memory of its outraged love ! E'en when my lips a smile fallacious wear, Λ One mournful feeling broods for ever there,— > A silent, secret pang that none can share. j That love in heaven could make my hours unblest, That hate for Richard s r ex a martyr's rest î Then, Chiefs, suspect not Bertrand's soul of guile, He dares to frown, but treachery svears a smile." " Yet," cried the Emerald Knight, who ne'er till then In council spoke, aud never spoke agen, 230 Why vents a Knight his rage in idle svords ? Warriors should trust their quarrels to their swords!" " I svould, but Richard ever shunn'd the strife, He said, his sister bade him spare my life ; His sister !"—here a scornful laugh he tried, But the feign'd mirth in sobs convulsive died. ic Indeed," ('twas Raymond spoke) " I did thee wrong, My zeal traosgress'dy—forgive th' intemperate tongue ; May heaven like mine thy cause of wrath remove, And bind again the broken links of love. 240 к 4
Hate should not live in souls where honour grows, For demons triumph when the good are foes." Another week, a week of anxious care, Brought to their council Mosul's generous heir. In peace he came, and those that wont to shun His arm in war, his mild demeanor won. ŕí From Joseph's royal seed, from Asia's King, Her Shield and Sword; health, greeting, love I bring: Such love as heroes mingle with their war, And pity, such as noble foes may bear. 250 His soul is panting to renew the strife, Where sword with sword contends, and life with life ; But like a viper darkling to destroy, Becomes not him; —the eagle perch'd on high, Respects the helpless dove that roosts below ; The hungry lion spares the slumbering foe. And from yon regions where the prince of day Bursts through the hills, to where his parting ray Gilds with ætherial hues the dancing brine, His scouts have scour'd the plains of Palestine. 260 Whate'er his lot, the dungeon or the tomb, Our hands are guiltless of your Monarch's doom.
Yet more—the godlike Soldan scorns to press, Ev'n on his foes, in weakness and distress ; Till him you mourn, returning like a star, Dispel your darkness and restore the war, Or till the moons bring round the various year, Rest ! Christians, rest ! unharnťd and harmless here. Bid yon ripe fields their nodding gold resign, Press the fat olive, ease the burthen'd vine ; 2/Ό But Λνΐιβη the days of proffer'd truce expire, As warriors wait him, or as friends retire." But Raymond now, who mark'd that every eye To his was lifted, gave the prompt reply : iC Bear back our greetings—bid the Soldan own Our souls are worthy, since we take his boon ; Peace, for our Monarch's sake, we stablish here, Till Richard come, or till the closing year." The Prince but staid to share with cheerful soul The pledge of truce, the feast, the brimming bowl, Then, vaulting on his faithful steed, once more To Syria's lord the pledge of concord bore. Yet still with spicy sweets the goblets flow, And chace the clouds from each relaxing brow ; When 'mid the Chiefs, with mien uncouth and rude, A dark brown man in garb monastic stood.
" Whence and what art thou ?" fiery Bertrand cried; " What thou wilt blush to hear," the monk replied. " Slave to the Mountain Prince, and Conrad's foe— He wilľd the murder, and I gave the blow ; 290 I and Alkamor, who already lies Blest in our master's promis'd Paradise. Thou deem'st a Christian King the poniard sped, But he who smiles when heaven enjoins to shed The blood of Misbelievers, bids ye know He hated Conrad, and he laid him low." 1 " Unhappy wretch!" ('twas Hubert's holy voice) te Deluded, canst thou murder and rejoice ? Nor conscience checks thee, nor the timely fear, That death and tortures wait th' Assassin here." 300 ' c Death !" he exclaim'd, " oh, ne'er for idle breath Did coward sue, as Hassan's slaves for death. Who once has tasted heaven, finds earth a void ; Yet sheathe your swords ; not thus to be destroyed, To me his hands the happy poison gave— Your tortures cannot reach, your malice save." O'er his pale brow the painful flushes came, And stroug convulsions shook his sinewy frame ; Yet with each pang his phrenzied raptures rise,— "\ tC Now rend my flesh, insulting Giaours," he crics,> My soul is blest-—it soars to Paradise." j
And backward as he fell, his clenching hand And angry Ьголу defied the алуевП'иск band. k But fix'd as though th' infectious venom spread Through his cold veins, and pallid as the dead, Fierce Bertrand stood,—and when at length he broke His silent trance, he felt not that he spoke. e< How little deem'd I, in iny years of youth, When all my thoughts were love, my accents truth, That one black drop could poison all my mind !— 320 Must I, who held that passion луав not blind, Nor bate unjust—e'en while my slanderous tongue Spoke what my heart denied—confess the wrong ? Perfidious Richard !—oh, the time has been, Who injured thee had found my falchion keen ; When I, methinks, had wonder'd less to see The sun all darkness, than a spot in thee. Had'st thou been faithful, I could bend me yet— But to bc humble, луЬеге Ι νοΛνΜ to hate ; To thee, yet tarnish'd лу1Й1 so deep a stain— 330 Oh ! could that blot be cleans'd ! could'st thou again Seem to my soul what I believed thee first, That, that were rapture, though my heart might burst !" That very eve, array'd in palmer's луееа, With staff* and palm-branch, shell, and scrip and bead,
Alone he left the camp : and none might tell, If foes enthrali'd him, if he lived or fell ; His squires in vain the Baron's fate explore. And Perigueux receives her lord no more. 'Twas at tbe midnight hour when all was still, 340 Save the soft zephyr and the murmuring rill, The convent chaunts that glided on the air, Or tbe low murmur of secluded prayer ; That Richard's bride the Virgin's name adored, And called a blessing on her absent lord. Small was the chapel, but no vulgar hand Had framed the holy fabric, simply grand. Light rose the cluster'd shafts, till far aloof They branched and knotted on the gilded roof; Or broke in pointed arches, where between, 350 The foliaged tracery form'd an open screen. There never prying eye or noon-day glare Burst on the tranquil sanctity of prayer, But through the windows' rich and complex frame, Solemn and soft, the various radiance came ; On the rich pavement deeper hues were thrown, And sculptured Saints in holier grandeur shone.
But most the Virgin's form—oh ! surely wrought By hands inspired, the marble breathed and thought ! Her look so radiant with maternal grace, 360 Such opening glory in the infant's face ! She stood behind a gem'd and gilded shrine, That made her simple beauty more divine ; While mimic stars and skies of purple hue, O'er the bright vision purer lustre threw. One lamp alone diffused a steady light On Berengaria's robes of spotless white ; For though, while dubious of her consort's fate, She quench'd each taper that in festal state Had deck'd the shrine, and meekly laid aside 370 Her splendid robes and ornaments of pride, She shunn'd the mourning vest Matilda wore, And aught might whisper, Richard lived no more ! She forced her cheek the hue of hope to wear, Nor flow'd her tears, save at her secret prayer. In meek devotion ЬолуМ her pious soul, Her eyes were raised to heaven ; her sorrows stole, Silent, unconscious------But what light divine Beams from the sculptured form, the gorgeous shrine ? The gilded glory grew to lambent flame, 380 O'er the cold cheek a living lustre came ;
'Mid gales from opening Eden breathed around One heavenly light, one pure seraphic sound : Yet sweeter far than angel harpings, broke Th' entrancing accents, when the Virgin spoke. " Rise, Berengaria s Heaven approves thy prayer, Thy dauntless Richard claims celestial care ; Let prudence now thy daring purpose veil, But Europe waits thee,—spread the willing sail ; Nor tremble thou when whirlwinds chafe the tide, 390 The power that bids thee go, shall guard aud guide." She ceas'd,—th' aerial music sunk away, The form grew cold, the glory ceas'd to play ; But one pure beam, thence never more to part, Of faith, of comfort, fill'd the mourner's heart. Now to her sight the brave Toulouse she bade, Albert, Matilda, and the captive maid. With joy they heard the words of hope, and prest \ To share her toils, and heaven-directed quest ; s. But smiling she her mild reproof addrest, 400 y te When thus supernal wisdom points the way, It fits not us to question, but obey. While to your prudence only I confide My venturous errand, be it yours to hide.
Alone I mount the bark,—or if indeed, Whom angels guard a mortal champion need, Let Richard's choice be mine ; a noble knight, Beloved by all, alike in bower or fight, Whose open truth with strictest honour blends, Whose frankness charms, whose freedom ne' er offends. Say, gallant Albert ! know'st thou whom I seek ? Or has thy modest worth a sight too weak ? A monarch traced the portrait, when he gave The charge, erewhile, to guard me o'er the wave." " Nay, generous lady, whose th' ungrateful ear, That would not glosv at praise thus doubly dear ? To Richard, who the knightly badge bestosv'd, And Richard's Queen, my faithful sword is vow'd ; But thus preferr'd, while hopes I dared not speak Strove in my heart, and burn'd upon my cheek, 420 What words may now my secret transports tell!"— \ « Aye," said the Queen, "I read thy riddle well, > Thou long'st to cheer thy svidow'd Rosabelle, — y But sigh not now—I hear the matin lark ! His next blithe strain shall call us to our bark. 'Tis meet that we to Richard's mother shesv The dire occasion of our public woe.
To fix what means may loose the Monarch's chain, What war must force, or embassy may gain, Albert, the care be thine—thy mission known, 430 Shall blind suspicious eyes, and hide my own. My sex and rank a pilgrim's weeds shall veil, Nor blazon'd arms betray the royal sail."* Mild breath'd the southern breeze, the vessel flew, Now Ascalon, now Jaffa sinks from view ; Dark Arsouf's wooded heights, and Napolose, And Cesarea fade ; then Carmel rose, And conscious Acre ;—still in sanguine hue St. George's Cross from every rampart flew. Alas ! how different was ttľ extatic hour 440 When first she haiľd that long-expected shore ! When countless galleys gem'd the ocean round, And lights were glimmering on the blue profound ; When streamers waved, when every joyful tongue In holy transport rais'd the sacred song ; And rapture woke, till every heart became, Like earth and ocean, bathed in floods of flame. How many, then so full of hope and joy, Live but in fame, yet fame that cannot die î
And he the loftiest—but she might not dare 450 To feed such thoughts, they bordered on despair. Scandalion now, and Blanco's jutting coast, And the dim peaks of Lebanon are lost ; Desponding Tyre, and Sidon, great no more, Or honour'd only for her fame of yore ; And that capricious stream, now pure and clear, That erst, when spring revived the flowery year, Ran purple, mindful of Adonis' wound, With annual rites bewail'd, with annual garlands crown'd.* Berytus now, and Tripoli they past, 460 And now, rejoicing in the changing blast, For Cyparissa's favourite isle they steer ;— First Famagousta's marble domes appear, And known Limisso ; next Colosso rose, Soft shadowy Paphos, and th' Olympian snows ;,Paradise Lost, VOL. If. I.
Till leaving far those conquer'd shores, again The vessel bounded o'er th' Ionian main ; From Rhodes, where soon/mid famine,fire, and death, Thy Knights, St. John, shall earn th' unfading wreath, To white-cliff d Crete, Jove's once selected shore; 470 Corinth and Argos, mighty now no more. But soon dark clouds the azure heaven o'ercast, From southern regions came the angry blast ; In vain the pilot seeks Sicilia's coast, For with the hidden stars his hopes are lost. 1 He drives by Cephalonia's fruitful isle, Zanté, where cloudless suns for ever smile,™ And old Corcyra ; now Rygusa's towers Are near, and now Ancona's rival shores. Now through the falling torrents dimly seen, 480 Shone like a star the Adriatic Queen. In vain with strenuous oar and shifting sail They seek the harbour, for the furious gale Drives on the bark, while, oh ! portentous sight, Burns on the helm dire Helen's fatal light !" The shore, so long desired, is now too nigh, Where countless shoals in fatal ambush lie ! Alone, unmoved, serene amid despair, With folded arms, and lost in silent prayer,
On the tall prosv the seeming pilgrim stood, 190 And gazed un fearing on the boiling flood, The billosv broke, the crashing beams give svay, The lordly castle is the ocean's prey ! She sinks beneath the wave—then Albert sprung, Her name, her secret trembles on his tongue ! But ero wds w ithheld the youth, " Beh old," they cried, " Heaven chose its victim ! mark the sinking tide, Mark on the helm th' auspicious fires divide ! Let yon feign'd saint his secret guilt atone (Pure as he seem'd), nor all be risk'd for one." 500 He heard them not, nor had the loyal knight Been thus restrained, but nosv the flashing light Beams o'er the calmer deep, and bids him mark Hosv on that svrcck, as on a gallant bark, She stems the sea ; and every surge that to«t Their heaving galley, svafts her to the coast. And nosv she quits her hold 5 she springs to land, Treads firm in hope, and svaves them from the strand. Nor vainly svaves,—before the changing gale, Down the deep gulf the merry seamen sail ; 510 Messina's dangerous straits are past, more near Sardinia's ite and Atlas' snows appear ; L 2
Steep Calpé's brow and Lusitania's shore Rí 'e,·— they hail their native cliffs once more. Soon Albert spurr'd bis steed, nor paus'd to viesv Hosv different from the prosperous realm he knesv, The peaceful happy home, was England now ! Where fear and sorrosv darken'd every brosv ! He hastes svhcre Windsor, from her height of pride, Asves svoods and vales, and Thames' meandering tide; Nor lingers, saddening o'er the alter'd scene, Λ When ruin mark'd where recent svar had been, > Till nosv~he bends before the Regent Queen. ) Years, more than oft the temperate peasants know, Had traced deep furrows on her polish'd brosv ; To silver hue had changed her raven hair, And thinn'd her cheek,—but still its rose was there; Not yet one sparkle from her eye svas fled. Unbent her form, and firm her stately tread. Once that keen eye and flushing brosv confest 530 Passions too strong to fit a female breast :— But wrongs arous'd them,—she had heard her name In Antioch blacken'd with unworthy shame ; Divorced, despised, had fled the Gallic strand, With sows of vengeance on her native land ;
Again a Queen, in captive gloom had borne, Her faithless Henry's private, public scorn. Her rage broke forth, she sought in desperate hour Her lovely foe's involved and wondrous bower ; 'Twas said the venom'd bowl and murderous brand, In dreadful choice she tender'd to her hand : But this was slander, Rosamond the while, Atoned her guilt in Woodstock's convent pile ; Now o'er her dust the sculptured marble rose, And daily masses sought her soul's repose. 0 But Eleanor the pilgrim Knight embraced, Then, while her heart its swelling grief represt, Ask'd of her favourite son,— that son whose reign Freed her from bonds, and gave to power again. p " Fear not to speak—his fatal loss we know— 550 111 news fly fast, 'tis good that travels slow."* " Lady, he lives ! and heavenly lips betray, Or soon his foes shall yield their royal prey." Then to her ear alone the Knight confest The wondrous vision, and his Sovereign's quest ; Till she, who never bent in adverse hour, Pour'd from her aged eyes a joyful shower ;,L 3
And oft and oft, with growing interest, sought To hear the deeds her Cœim de Lion wrought. " Speak of that battle, Albert ! speak again— 560 'Tis my sole solace now—Oh ! that Mor taigne Had been like him we mourn, or never been. Look out, on all this once delightful scene, Look through the land, its curses breathe in vain On him, alike unfit to serve or reign ; False to his King, and, worse, Augustus' tool ; A traitor to the state he seeks to rule ! Leagued with its foes—but he may find too late Their specious friendship deadlier than their hate." Sad was the tale.-—Though faithful, Longchamp's ч hand f Had proved too feeble for a realm's command ;— í With power inebriate, he opprest the land, J Afiected more than courtly state, defied His mitred colleague, and inflamed his pride : Till Durham, conscious of his wealth and power, Call'd his new Primate from the Norman shore. 4 He, son of Clifford's fair and erring child, Led for his reverend robes a life too wild j Loved more the midnight bowl and wanton lyre, Than Ebor's matchless fane and solemn quire. 580
And royal Richard, ere he left the west, Gave with a brother's kiss a King's behest ; (The same to John with oaths confirm'd before), For three full years to shun the English shore/ But John was early false, and Geoffrey now Deem'd that his priestly rank absolved the vow. With Pembroke join'd, the princely pair demand The delegated seals from Longchamp's hand ; While Eleanor, by frequent insults moved, Too rashly sanciion'd what her lords approved.* 590 But the torn kingdom, drown'd in blood and tears, Soon proved the justice of her Monarch's fears. How little, when with lavish hand he shed Princedoms and honours on his brother's head. Had Richard seen from whence the storm should lour, Or thought his gifts but gave rebellion power ! In scorn of Arthur's infant rights, Mortaigne Now spoke of heirship to his brother's reign. Homage at Philip's feet he hastes to pay ;* Philip, who false to heaven and Vezelay, 600 Now claims the Norman rule; —with virtuous pride, Her hoary Seneschal the King defied ;,L 4
Enraged he prest to arms,—but vainly prest, For honour, banish'd from the Sovereign's breast, Lived in his nobles,-—" they had truly sworn l To guard his rights, till Richard should return." 1 Sick at the light that makes his glory pale. (For Richard's triumphs breath'd on every gale,)" He heard of Conrad's fall—his slanderous tongue With darker scandal swells the Austrian's wrong ; 610 And swears the Monarch, now by practice grown Expert in murder, next intends his own.* Indignant England smiled, but soon deplored, Captive or slain, her dear heroic Lord ; As when o'er Egypt heavenly vengeance moved, Seem'd each sad heart to mourn its best beloved. Revered, yet not for regal pomp alone, His martial fame and far-descended crown, But for that hand, whose gifts prevent distress, That soul, which revelľd in its power to bless ; 620 Whose first command absolved the prisoner's chain, Lest one lorn wretch should hear and curse his reign.*
He loved the dance, the feast, the minstrel song Himself could raise so well, the glittering throng Of princely jousts :—<oh ! could his realm forbear To worship one to whom its sports were dear ! Guilt drops her mask,—the rebel, bolder grown, Now fables Richard's death, and mounts the throne. Through Gloucester's fruitful vale, (her ample dower) xAvisa spreads revolt*—from Thikehill's tower, 630 From Durham's hill, from Derby's massy keep, To where th' Atlantic laves St. Michael's steep, The battle raged ; but soon from Neustria's coast Th' intrepid Queen leads on her little host ; With York, who, faithful to his Monarch, now Laments his rash revenge and slighted vow. Against the rebel force her powers combine, The martial Durham, Cestria's Palatine, Leicester, in Syrian fields with glory crown'd, Bardolf and Stutevillej Strigulph, long renown'd 640 In Erin's wars, and for his matchless bow/ All sheathed in arms, with loyal ardour glow. Windsor they save, they guard the menaced shores/ And draw their lines round Thikehill's reverend towers.
The Norman confines Philip threats in vain, The Queen upholds her Son's invaded reign. " Yet," she resumed, " not yet is Thikehill ours, Nor Nottingham, nor steep St. Michael's towers j III may the cause one faithful Baron spare. This weighty mission must be Albert's care. 650 Before th* imperial synod boldly stand, And from the Austrian Duke the King demand ; When to his Peers his treason yoii proclaim, If not to justice, he must yield to shame.— Seek then with happiest speed thine own domain, And from thy vassals chuse the fitting train ; But think, a nation's curse will brand delay, Not e'en thy lovely bride must win thy stay." Six times the dawn beheld him on his course, Six welcome nights reposed his weary horse ; 660 But with the seventh, at sunset's purple hour, Peer'd o'er the dusky woods his well-known tower. " See, see, my squire, the light that glimmers there, In that lone cell thy Lady chose for prayer ! To Syria's holy war her fancy roams— Yes ! heaven has heard thy Λνί^ίι, thy Albert comes.
Swift, swift, and she shall soothe thy pride, and feed And bless thee for my weal, my faithful steed ; Swift í thou hast yet some weary leagues to pass, And deep and dangerous is the green morass." 670 Not idle was the fear,—while yet he spoke. The ground beneath their floundering palfreys broke. With much of time and labour freed at last, Their way was dangerous and the daylight past ; The dancing wildfire gleams on every side, Bewildering only whom it seems to guide ; Oft in deep bogs the faithless path is lost, Oft by tall reeds and tangling brushwood crost ; And ere again they reach'd the open wold. The night was black, the midnight bell had toU'd. 080 Slow rose the clouded moon, long shadows fall, And dark and massive frown'd the castle-wall. " The bridge is down !" cried Albert ; " why so late ? No bolts secured, no warder at the gate ? The light is vanish'd from my Lady's tower, Sweet dove î thou sleep'st iu an unguarded bovver, This horn must chase thy dreams." Alas! how well That deep full strain was known to Rosabelle ! How oft, when seated in her father's hall, Her blush betray'd she kne tv the distant call ! 690
How oft would she from dreams of pleasure wake, When echo bore it o'er the moonlight lake ! Why wakes not now ? has she forgot the strain ! And all his vassals ?—hark ! he breathes again. Yet no reply—the silence chilis his breast, With naked weapon o'er the bridge he prest ; He reach'd the hall—the embers still were red, There still the fragments of the feast were spread, But all was lonely ; to his lady's bower He flew ; his cries re-echoed through the tower ! 700 In vain—her snowy veil is on the chair, Her favourite dove securely roosted there ; And where her maidens wrought th' embroidered vest, Still in th' unfinish'd work their needles rest ; And in that cell, where every morn and even She poured her fervent orisons to heaven, Her opened missal on the cushion spread, Her cross and rosary by its side were laid ; And from the wreath луЫсЬ bound her auburn hair, A vagrant rose stili bloom'd unwithcr'd there ; f\0 There was the book she laid aside for prayer, The plaintive lay some troubadour had wove, A mournful legend of forsaken love.
Still her mild spirit seem'd to breathe around, And fancy, starting at the slightest sound, Hears in the wailing breeze her silver tone, Or light approaching step,—but fancy hears alone. Oh ! height of grief ! but Bernard ventures near, Half roused to mirth and half deprest by fear : " Sure some magician rules these lonely halls ! 720 The steeds yet feed securely in their stalls, But not a wight is nigh—yet come, for you, My master, have I spread the feast anew ; The crackling blaze shall cheer the wakeful hour, At morn, perchance, the spell may lose its power.— But why that vacant gaze ? and from thy hand Why drops, unconsciously, the blazing brand ? No signs of war, nor blood nor arms are here, Nor wert thou wont the wizard's art to fear— Trust me, my lord, to cheat her lonely hours, 730 Thy lady seeks Iltz Ranulph's Cestrian towers ; Her lovely cousins there with her prolong The lively dance, the feast, the choral song." " Peace!" Albert cried, "oh! think not to deceive (S With hopes you cannot, while you speak, believe; If mirth like theirs could cheer her widow'd heart, Would Edric, would my warlike train depart ?
What spirit dropp'd the veil, the rosebud there, Or through this lattice shed the treacherous glare ? Curse on the bog, the dark and tangled shade— With that lost hour my earthly bliss is fled ! Yet bring my steed,--if Ronald struck the blow, Yet Ronald ever was a generous foe,— Nor here one trace of war ; this murky night Again may wilder, we must wait for light. In such an hour to lose thee, Rosabelle, — Ah ! no—the morning will not break the spell." A cheerful blaze was in the lonely hall, That shesv'd the banners on each trophied wall ; 750 Therounded arch, through which the night wind sigh'd, And shook the mouldering wrecks of martial pride ; The mighty chesnut beams, that, in disdain Of time and mining worms, the roof sustain ; Where shapes grotesque barbaric sculpture traced, Or the fine forms of classic Rome debased. The oaken board—whose merry guests were gone,— The chair of state and bench of massy stone ; On all by turns the flickering radiance play'd, Here broad in light, there sunk in sable shade. 760 With vizor down, that Bernard might not trace His varying thoughts reflected on his face,
book The warrior sate remote, and watch'd his squire Drain the red bowl or slumber by the fire j One might have deem'd that grief had conquered rest, But the long toil his weary frame opprest, And nature claimM her hour,—as long he mused On his dear loss, still more and more confused, His aching head perplex'd the painful theme, And wild conjecture glides into a dream. 77® Through the long windows now the morning light Streams various on the hall—up starts the knight : {S Wake ! Bernard, trim the fading fire once more,— But lo ! what mean these blood drops on the floor? Perchance these dancing rays confuse my sight, No ! it is blood, nor was it here at night !" Full in their view and vivid was the stain, No man was near them, and conjecture vain. Why should a friend have fled ? and if a foe, What from his slumbering prey withheld the blow ? And whence the blood ? what hand could give the wound ? They rise and search, above, below, around ; Each winding corridor, each trophied room, The turrets' airy height, the dungeon's gloom.
The bridge their haste at night forgot to raise, Is lifted nosv, and sanguine stains betrays ; Hence, if for good or ill, the walls contain The mystic guest, svhom yet they seek in vain. His blood flow'd freely in the dauntless chief, 790 Hope waked again, and wonder master'd grief ; But every noise the trembling squire appalls, Rejoiced when Albert sent him from the svalls. " Go to Lord Ronald's border tosver, and svell Observe his bearing, and conjure him tell, If aught he know of Lady Rosabelle ? Mark, at my greeting if his cheek be pale, Or his frank nature kindle at the tale, Then speed thou here ; some mystery hovers round, Nor svill I hence until its clue be found." 800 Forth rides the gladden'd Squire—the knight alone, His grief and wonder wore a softer tone, And pausing as he paced the echoing hall, Or gazed on trophied arms that graced the svall, His memory svaked again the hopes and fears, The woes, the pleasures of his early years. Oft on that seat reclined the aged pair, Who train'd the friendless orphan as their heir.
One stormy night, when all was drear and dark, Sunk on Northumbria's rocks a founder'd bark ; 810 One plank alone through tossing surges bore An helpless female and her child to shore. Vain were the Baron's cares, his lady's vain, For scarce her languid eyes unclosed again ; She gazed upon her sobbing child, she sigh'd, Drew from her hand an emerald ring,—and died ! Above his years appear'd the orphan's pain, But kindness won his rosy smiles again ; Nurs'd by the childless pair, who saw with joy His grateful heart, and blest his laughing eye. 820 Oft, breathless, had he listen'd when they told Of ancient worthies, courteous, wise, and bold ; That shield, which now the rust of ages wore, Great Arthur's Peer, white-handed I vain bore, And that, whose orb the spotless steed reveaľd, The Conqueror braved on Hastings' fatal field. The Baron gloried in his graudsire's might, Who bled for freedom and his country's right, Then, 'mid the wreck of all her native band, By arms maintain'd his honours and his land ; 830 While Albert's heart his alien race denied, And felt in each bold chief a filial pride. VOL. II. ΛΙ
Here, too, as years increas'd, his fancy wove The fairy day-dreams of awakening love.· - Oh ! how was every happy vision crost ! His reverend guardians gone, his lady lost ! Cail'd by bis Sovereign in his bridal hour, To bear the Holy Cross on Syria's shore ; Yea, on the day that should have crown'd his bliss, Yet e'en a lover's fears had spared him this.— 840 He sought her chamber, and with throbbing breast Kiss'd her white veil, her silent dove carest ; He rais'd her book, oh ! sacred song has power To calm the wildest, soothe the saddest hour ! And well this tale might charm, whose lofty tone Now rais'd the hero's soul, now bade him moan O'er kindred griefs—but as the interest grows, He hears behind the chamber door unclose ; He starts, he lifts the falchion at his side,— From the rais'd latch a hand appears to glide ; 850 Forward he springs, he speaks, but nought is there ;— In vain he rushes down the winding stair : He hears a closing door, and following fast, He reach'd a room, whose narrow windows cast A doubtful light, and columns, thick and plain, The low-brow'd arches of the roof sustain.
The svalls are darken'd with his moving shade, The floor re-echoes to his iron tread ; But there he stands alone—nor foe svas nigh, Nor way appear'd through which such foe might fly ! Wearied and sad, he yet his search renesv'd, Till Bernard spoke, re-entering from the wood. " Courteous svas Ronald's mien, nor blanch'd his cheek With conscious treachery, as he bade me speak : c I greet Lord Albert on his safe return,— His Sovereign's fate, his lady's loss I mourn. When Europe sees Messiah's foes subdued, Our hands again may wake our Border feud ; But doubt not me, тпу fury never falls On helpless women and unguarded svalls : 870 True to the peace for Sion's holy cause, And true to honour's yet severer laws, Had I but known this treachery, aim'd too лл т е11, My ssvord, my life, had guarded Rosabelle.' As home I sped, not careless of my quest, My cautious speech each labouring hind addrest ; But war has spared thy halls—nor has Mortaigne, With lawless plunderers ravaged thy domain ; And yesternight, as for her honour'd lord, Thy lady's svill had spread the bounteous board," 880 m 2
Alas ! the hope that buoyed is fading полу, And blank despondence sits on Albert's brow. The evening shadows loug and darker fall, The rusty armour rattles on the wall ; Chill breathes the wind—forth fares th'officious squire, To seek fresh fuel for the fading fire. What means that shriek ? lo ! gasping, pale, aghast, Comes Bernard back, and speaks with pain at last, ci I saw him ! there the hooded spectre past—" " Peace! Peace! thou dream'st—But soft ! what form is there?"— 890 Up springs the knight, and down the winding stair, Regardless that the figure seem'd to tread A different path, to that dark chamber sped. Screen'd by a pillar's shade, Λνίίΐι aching brain And breath suppress'd, he watch'd, nor watch'din vain : With shrouded torch, that scarce his features shew'd, And tatter'd garments, black with clotted blood, Silent and slow, as though his tottering frame Scarce bore his weight, the hideous phantom came. It bent to earth, and from the hollow floor 900 Strove, feebly strove, to raise a secret door ; But from his lair the watchful Albert springs, Prone on the ground th' astonish'd wretch he flings :
" Speak or thou diest,"— et Yes ! rather will I die, Than shew thee where my master's treasures lie." " Edric !—just Heaven !—then all may yet be well, 'Tis Albert speaks—but where is Rosabelle ?" a My master ! thou art safe !—then prais'd be Heaven ! Yet svas it but for this my life was given ? To tell thee this—but fear may worse foresee, 910 She lives, I trust, and yet may live for thee." Soon Bernard drest the couch and spread the board, When Edric spoke, to transient strength restored. " Alas ! 'tis vain—my svound can never heal, Yet let me, луЫ1е I may, its source reveal. But yestermorn so fair, so blythe of cheer, Here was my lady, all thy vassals here ; Long had she loved to muse and weep alone, But then warm hope inspired her cheerful tone : * Long hast thou seen, good Seneschal !' she said, 920 ' How ill my cares this niggard myrtle paid ; Behold it nosv, hosv gay since yesternight, In fragrant blossoms drest of bridal svhite ! Say, Edric ! svilt thou mock my lively cheer, Or trust my omen that my lord is near ? m 3
Nay, smile not·—if a dream, 'twill fade too fast^— But let this day in martial games be past ; Too long røy sadness has your mirth represt, But now I bid you spread the joyful feast.' " Ill-omen'd feast 1 perchance less strongly barr'd Our gates were left, less watchful was our guard. The sun was set, the goblet circled round, AH lesser noise our jovial chorus drown'd; When lo ! an armed band, unmark'd before, From the full board three struggling yeomen bore. 'Twas dusk—helm, sword, and shield were laid aside, But with such arms as haste and chance supplied We rose—across the bridge and through the wood, The stranger villains fled, and we pursued ; Unconscious of the lurking ambuscade, 940 To death or slavery were our band betray'd. Confused, unarmed, the flower of all our train With thee in Syria, our defence was vain ; To each unguarded heart the falchion sped— Yon bog engulph'd the dying and the dead. " And now a troop, svho shamed the spurs they wore, Thy weeping lady from tlie castle bore, And all her train !—Oh ! had I then been free,— Yet what svere one?—I bent the suppliant knee,
I proffer'd half thy wealth.—With scornful smile, 950 Their Chief replied, < For many a weary mile, O'er land and flood, from distant realms we came For this fair prize, and shall I yield the dame ? Forego the hope !—yet be thy treasures shewn ; Her freedom heed not, but secure thiue own : So thou, if here thy wandering lord return, May'st tell thy tale, aud teach him how to mourn.'— (t Ney er" —I said. i( Die then, rash fool !" he cried, And pierc'd, unknightly, my unguarded side. Senseless I fell :—when thought return'd, I found 960 The villains fle л , and all in silence round. Feebly I totter'd here, a knight and squire Were all I saw, safe slumbering by the fire. Oh ! had I guest it thee, my gallant Chief, What joy had given my bleeding heart relief!" " And know'st thou not fromsvhence the trai tor came, His rank, his arms, to give my vengeance aim ?" " His speech was Austrian, and his antique shield, A Griffin dreadful on a crimson field." Soon Edric's spirit wing'd its peaceful flight, 9/0 And weeping England claim'd her lingering knight. " Too long have private svoes delay'd," he cried, t( Alas ! those fatal words, c not e'en thy bride.' Λί 4
Yet said he not au Austrian ? Heavenly Power ! Thy ways are wondrous ! teach us to adore. For there at least shall Schorndorfs noble heir My sorrows lighten and my dangers share. Friend of my youth, oh ! should'st thou, Theodore, At once my Sovereign and my bride restore !"— He left his desert halls and lone domain ; 980 "ч Two reverend Abbots form'd his peaceful train, \ And favouring breezes bore him o'er the main. 1,END OF BOOK XII,

CŒUR DE LION.,BOOK хш.,THE CASTLE OF TRIVALLIS. Mkanwhile the Queen, in safety borne to land, Knelt, meekly thankful, on the desert strand. Nor town nor tosver svere near ;—she sought repose, Where on the beach a fisher's hut arose : There, lone in age, a hospitable pair The wanderer welcomed to their homely fare. A minstrel youth, his losvly state above, Who saw his lady's charms, and dared to love, Erewhile, as from his jealous lord he fled, To this lone shore malicious fortune led. 10
To ocean's winds he pour'd his plaintive song, Or sigh'd that river's shadowy banks along, Which, bursting from Goritia's heights, retains Its mountain cold in Aquileian plains.* One sultry noon he sought the frigid wave, Too rashly dared, and found a wat'ry grave. Now for her dripping weeds the gentle Queen His harp assumes, and vesture, white and green ;f With liberal hand a due reward bestow'd, And took at early dawn, her lonely road. 20 Oft as she stray'd, while passing fancies fire, She wakes soft music from the trembling lyre.— 'Twas autumn : yet, by fervid noon opprest, Now on a shelter'd bank she paus'd to rest -, A knight who homeward leads with gentle pace His train, victorious in the morning chace, Glanced on the bard,— who, heaven-directed, strung The ready harp, and thus spontaneous sung :
" Turn, knight ! a weary minstrel sings ; The dews relax his trembling strings, 30 And hunger chills his tongue ; Yet blest shall be the hand that brings, A cup to cheer the Child of Song. ťí From fair Provence, my native land, I've roam'd to many a foreign strand, Nor found my svandering» long ; While still my strains repaid the hand, Which cheer'd the vagrant Child of Song. f< Thou goest—then take the minstrel's curse,— Be bold, be great, but never verse 40 Thy memory shall prolong ; Forgot, ere lifted from thy hearse, For thou hast scorn'd a Child of Song." íť A svinning strain!" the haughty Maynard cried, Thy saucy boldness I svere best to chide : Yet come with me, I reck not of thy curse, But my sick dame may love thy southern s r erse ; And (or thy art svill poorly pay thy pain) For lady's ear thou timest a softer strain."
Dark was Coufit Maynard, and his scowling look 3 Had yet less promise than his accents spoke. The towers of Gortz, upon the forest side, Less shew'd his liberal spirit than his pride. There all svas grand, and numerous vassals found His ample board with daily plenty crown'd; But 'mid the guests still lurk'd distrust and fear, Nor habit chaeed restraint, nor svine could cheer. His dame was one whose early fancy wove, And young experience broke, her dreams of love ; She found her lord still first in tilt or fight, 60 Still drest in smiles for high-born beauty's sight, But the smooth brow, the courtier grace, that shone In other mansions, never cheer'd his own. Though still due honours to her rank he gave, And gilt his victim's cage—a splendid slave— Her heart was chiiľd, her hour of rapture o'er, Her roses wither'd, ah í to bloom no more. Her disappointed spirit oft was shewn In look of discontent, or peevish tone ; And her harsh chiding, 'mid her virgin train, 70 Oft sprung the tear her kindness dried again. And now, though anxious for his promis'd heir, Count Maynard's pride could ape affection's care ;
His tardy smile was answered by a tear, And wrung the heart it beam'd too late to cheer. As for a friend, she languish'd for the grave, And wish'd to perish in the life she gave. A gorgeous coueh her faded beauty bore, As Berengaria near the chamber door Leant on her harp ;—a blush was on her cheek, 80 And her soft eyes her pitying soul bespeak. " Advance, young bard !" began the pensive dame, " I love the heart that beats alone for fame ; Yet thou, who livest 'mid visions of thine own, Of bliss and virtue to the world unknown, Has thine ideal realm one charmed strain, To svake departed hope, or lull the stings of paia?" í( Oft, lady, boasts the muse such magic power, But such, perchance, is scarce your minstrel's dower; Yet svhere her spirit in Provençal vales, 90 Plays in each stream, and breathes in all her gales, My youthful ear her noble minstrels heard, And caught a strain from each sublimer bard. Vidal, who roams in fancy's wildest maze, Soft Marie's tales, b Alphonso's princely lays f His Sister, who beloved by Phœbus' quire, "4 Wakes in Provence her Arragonian lyre ; > Bertrand de Born, svhose youthful songs ss'ere fire ;^
Arnaud, svhose strains the female heart allure/ And England's pride, her Royal Troubadour. 100 Erewhile, in famed Avignon's shadowy grove When the gay Monarch held his íť Courts of Love," Oft have I heard, while raptured crosvds were mute, Ssveet Philomel, Love's Advocate, dispute On points of tender faith, with all the train Of gaudy Finches, fickle, light, and vain. For fancy svanton'd thus in frolic guise, When Princes bought, and Queens adjudged the prize." 1 " And who art thou, whose vaunting phrases tell," Observ'd the Count, íŕ of greatness known so svell ?" " Blondel my name ; and, but I prize the lyre \ Above the glory gallant deeds acquire, \ My birth might well to knightly rank aspire." j Thus spoke the Queen, by love impell'd to svear The name of one in youth to Richard dear. i( And svell such title fits a form so fair," The dame replied, ς ' those eyes, that golden hair. Nosv tune thy harp,—-I fain svould learn to live In thai brijht clime poetic fancies give ; But hing not love, for love is wild and mad, 120 Wrings the lorn heart, and makes the happy sad ;
It dreams of joy that mortals never gain, And faith, that lives but in the Minstrel's brain ; Sing not of love—I could not bear the strain." " Nay, Lady, would'st thou break my sweetest string ?— Yet can your bard in phrase romantic sing Those bolder notes that swell the northern lyre, And knightly youth to deathless deeds inspire/ Of awful magic, erst to Merlin known. Or lighter pranks by moonlight fairies shewn, 130 Of glorious war, of wounds with sword and lance, Great Arthur's peers, the Paladins of France."— " Strange songs for lady's ear ! Thy wayward muse," The dame rejoin'd, iC some gentler theme may chuse. Let warriors court the laurel glory weaves, I shudder at the blood that stains its leaves." " Would then some biting satire please thy mind, That paints the crimes and follies of mankind ? Such Pierre 3 has framed—" " Nay, nay, thy themes are strange, Capricious bard, hast thou no fitter change?" 140 " Nay, by my knighthood, the caprice is thine," The Count burst in, " or hear him or decline. VOL. II. N
Sing what thou wilt, keen satire, arms, or love, Or blend them all, and all shall then approve." Blondel obey'd—a pleasing air he rung, As Huon's wild and wondrous quest he sung. The merry squire, but most that beauteous fay, Whose tiny limbs celestial grace display ; His lily crown, his never-fading youth, His dance-inspiring horn, the test of truth ; 150 His bowl, whose ever-brimming sweets allure The guiltless touch, but shrink from lips impure : Of Huon's love, of Rezia's charms and woes, л Their mutual crime, and how the tempest rose, ч Till in a desert isle they found repose ; у And by their matchless truth at length restored The fond Titania to her elfin Lord.*· At first the dame with taste fastidious heard, Scann'd every thought, and carp'd at every word ; Then sigh'd if fabled woes recalľd her own, 160 Then thought and felt in Huon's fate alone ; Till on her cheek the long-lost colour rose, And her rous'd spirit mourn'd to hear the close.
"'Take this," she cried,and loos'd her golden chain *. " Take this, young bard, 'twill better pay thy strain," The Count began. With grateful glance he took And kist the chain, but turn'd with careless look From the full purse : " I am no venal bard, Your praise, your favour, are my best resvard." ťí Ha ! 'tis not полу, as when in years ot' old, 170 Castalia's fountain quench'd the thirst of gold, Too long, too well, our northern bards 1тл г е known To scorn the muse that pays with smiles alone ;" Thought the stern Count, and dark suspicion spoke In his black brow, and keen inquiring look ; Till as the seeming youth in haste withdresv, All her soft sex was in her glowing hue. In fear, yet forced her terrors to restrain, Silent she sate amid the menial train; Resolved to quit the fort with rising morn, ISO Nor thought how oft she pass'd th' untasted horn ; Till nosv she ask'd what princely halls were near, Whose bounteous lords the wandering minstrel cheer. ' c Few," said an aged page, <ť since Leopold Grasp'd this fair duchy in his iron hold, Their svealth betray, or dare their gates untold; N 2
And since his minions, from a foreign shore, That unknown captive to Trivallis bore."— " Nay wherefore pause ? oh ! svhy should fear inspire ? Lurks fraud in youth, or treachery in the lyre ? 190 Oh speak ! the Muse on tales of sorrow feeds. Reveal the path that to Trivallis leads." " Deep in a mountain wild, sublimely grand, And black with age, the triple turrets stand : 'Tis whisper'd those forbidden chambers hold Unnumber'd victims, and uncounted gold; This much is sure, whoe'er the Prince offends, In speech or action, foes, suspected friends, Those walls receive. They enter—ask no more ! For never yet did that relentless door 200 Disgorge its prey, th' irremeable bourne, Whence, like the gates of hell, is no return. Nay, there are tales (and bold sve deem the wight Who views that castle but by noonday light) Of dreadful screams, and sounds of mortal pain, And sheeted forms that drag the clanking chain ; And one who there, amid the moonlight stood, Deem'd that each guilty turret blush'd svith blood. These halls erewhile a transient shelter gave To one departing for that living grave : 210
To speak svas death, none knew his name or face, Yet sure such care betray'd a princely race ; And once, from yonder loophole dimly seen, I gazed at distance on his martial mien : I longed to give him arms, and bid him stand, Or fall as fits a svarrior, sword in hand ; And mourn'd to think that famine's slosv decay, And grief and chains, should wear those limbs away— But thou art pale, poor youth—thy svish forbear, The bard, believe me, wins no fas T our there." 220 While yet he bends to hear, a damsel came And calľd hím forth, to cheer her pensive dame. But pensive, languid she appear'd no more, A healthful glosv her lingering beauty svore. ťŕ Fair youth," she spoke, ťí or, by that blush betray'd, If right I guess thy secret, lovely maid ! My Lord has said,^— { be is not svhat he seems/ And chains are near svhen thus Count Maynard deems. Nay, do not speak, nor to my ear confide What wedded duty should not hear and hide ; 230 But I am grateful for the only jo) That years have brought, and ssould repay it, boy. Go to thy couch, but eve the dasvning day My damsel guides thee bs a secret svay, N 3
Beyond our walls ; if then a thought I claim, Breathe one brief prayer for Gortz' unhappy dame ; Thy youth has many a rainbosv dream to come, But mine are past, I sigh but for the tomb." i( Nay, gentle lady, rouse thee from despair, Not les 1 ? than thou I know the sveight of care ; 240 Perchance had all for svhich thy nature sighs, Perchance have lost svhat most thy heart would prize. But for the grave ! oh ! if thy fearless soul, Recoiling, start not from the dismal goal, Think that its rest is but for those who tread This darksome vale unfaltering, undismayed. 'Tis that beyond, for svhich we bravely beai The ills of life—oh î fix thy svishes there. It cannot chase thy woes, but they svill seem Like passing clouds that melt beneath the beam , 250 While every flower that decks the glistening spra), Each bird whose carol hails the orient day, Shall lift thy grateful thought to Him on high, Who in that radiance gives them life and joy." " I svould—1 svili— oh ' could'st thou safely stay— Thou heed'fet not gold, but, can I aid thy ss ay >" ťť Lady, these paths are rude ; my weary feet Bleed at th' unwonted toil." " My steed is fleet,
And shall bc thine—faresvell, be heaven thy guide ; Λ But mark me, svhere thou see'st the svay divide,260 V Turn to the right,—'tis to our Austrian pride, j Vienna ! but besvare the left hand path, It leads to dread Trivallis, chains and death. Faresvell, and pray that I may sleep in peace."— (i Dame, I will pray that soon thy griefs may cease ; But, rous'd to hope, new joys and softer fears, And proud of all a mother's pleasing cares, Till thou, like Huon and his bride, shall find Heaven yet is gracious, svhen it seems unkind." Freed from the castle ere the dawn of day, 270 The minstrel Queen pursued her anxious svay ; Scarce on the right hand path one glance bestosv'd, But took, impetuous, the forbidden road. Scarce could she still the beatings of ber breast, Or pause herself, or give her palfrey rest, When the hot sun in cloudless skies svas bright, Or glimmering stars diffused a doubtful light. She trod the burning crags, svhose ruins spread The dizzy ledge, and beetled o'er ber head ; Plunged in rude dells, unconscious of tbe beam, '260 Or to ib cradle traced tho brasvling stream ; л 4
Nor sought the goatherd's shed, —her scrip supplied The scanty meal, she drank the limpid tide. Till when at last those awful walls appear'd, Which cowards fled, and e'en the valiant fear'd, They seem 41 like forms in waking visions wrought, When hope obsequious paints the secret thought. Feli'd was the nearer wood—beyond, it rose To screen the fort, but not to hide its foes : High on a hill, the triple towers were seen, 290 On three huge crags, with horrid depths between ;'' A triple fosse the vast enclosure bound, And massy walls the triple vallum crown'd. The stones were black with age, the struggling day Scarce through the loopholes sent a scanty ray. From those dark halls no sounds of welcome breathe, No hamlet shelters in its shade beneath ; One awful beam th' autumnal evening threw, That tinged the western front with sanguine hue ; While from behind, the moon arising bright, 300 Clothed the pale landscape in contrasted light. She left her steed beneath the beechen shade, (( And art thou there, my best beloved 1" she said,
ťC Upbraiding all that to thy help should fly, Nor think'st ΛνΙίαΙ fond, what anxious heart is nigh." Eve's last soft flushes fade, and all is still, While veil'd in gloom, she climbs the arduous hill. Rude was the path, nor oft by pilgrim worn, O'ergrown with briars, long, ţvildering and forlorn : Scarce might the horseman trace that dangerous way, Through brakes, impervious to the summer day, Now wrapt in night ; while onward as she hies, Scared at her step the birds of carnage rise. At last, yet shrouded in the castle's shade, Cautious she crost its spacious esplanade ; Marked each strong wall with towers begirt around, The massy keep ΛνΙ^ lofty turrets c^vn'dj The boy who never dreamt of war might know Those алупл1 ramparts would but mock the foe -, While not one light the abode of man confest, 320 Or gave the weary pilgrim hope of rest. Those grated loopholes o'er the gate—ah there Perchance her Richard wastes ΛνΗΙι secret care ! Whose gifts were kingdoms, now by famine dies— His only prospect those relentless skies, His only visitants the bats, that pnnvl Round the grim tower, or nightly hooting owl !
Mournful she stood ; but soon the breeze that sighs Through her lone harp, bids other thoughts arise : " Yet, yet," she said, " some dear familiar strain 330 May reach his cell, and bolts and bars be vain ; While, should some jealous warder mark the lay, 'Tis but a minstrel sings to cheer his way. Ah, me ! that air to early love so dear, Even in the tomb might rouse my Richard's ear ; Oh ! could ï pour his deep clear tones along, And steal his accents as I steal his song.' " Frown, frown, Clorinda —I would prize Thy smile o'er all that arms might gain ; O'er wealth and fame ; yet mock my sighs, 340 My faded cheek, my tears despise, Nor I my fate arraign ; While every rival's grief I see. And know that all are scorn'd like mc." She ceased, for from on high a fuller tone, Though faint in distance, blended with her own ; That voice, those words could come from one alone.
Ct Oh smile not, if thou e'er bestosv On others, grace I think sincere ; Such smiles are like the beams that glow 350 On the dark torrent's bridge of snow, And wreck the wretch they cheer. Thine icy heart I svell can bear, But not the love that others share." Bright hour of rapture ! who may dare to tell In her fond breast what blended feelings swell ! With parted lips, closed eyes, and hands compren, To still th' impetuous beatings of her breast, Listening she stood ; svhile conscious memory strays, To that blest hour svhen first she heard the lays. 360 Extatic dream—at length her faltering tongue Its grief exprest in emblematic song : " The svidosv'd dove can never rest, The felon kite has robb'd her nest ; With wing unfcired she seeks her mate, To share or change his dreadful fate." Again she paused, and listening, from on high Caught from the friendly gale the faint reply.
" But kites a higher power obey, Th' Imperial Eagle claims the prey, — k 370 Hence ! to his spacious eyrie go, The Eagle is a nobler foe." She strikes the harp—" Farewell ? farewell !" Her thrilling notes o f transport swell : " The monarch bird may build his nest On oak, or tower, or mountain crest,— But love can match his daring flight, Can fell the tree, or scale the height." " Ho ! who art thou," a surly warder calls, Ci That därest to sing beneath Trivallis' walls >" 380 " A wandering bard, good friend, who fain would win, These awful gates to let the weary in," " Nay, hence—nor dare to touch thy harp again, And thank thy saints 'twas I that heard the strain ; Tired as thou art, fly swiftly o'er the heath, And shun these walls as thou would4t shun thy death." But was that pilgrim weary 5 oh í less fleet The mountain chamois plies itb fearless feet :
" Faresvell ! my ears are blest though not my eyes, Thy chains shall fall," she svarbles as she flies ; 390 i{ Thou gentle guardian of my steps, my svill, Take my soul's blessing and direct me still. At Haguenau soon the empire's magnates meet, Oh! touch the Eagle's heart—oh! guidemy wandering feet." For many a day through Austria's svide domains, By woods of tapering pine, or mountain plains, By hills the venturous goat alone had track'd, By placid lake or rushing cataract, She wander'd on ; and still at evening fall, The svoodman's hut, the convent or the hall Had given her rest, till nosv at day's decline NearEglisau she reach'd the rapid Rhine ; Where from the lake its azure current pours, And antique forests crosvn the lofty shores. Along the verge the lingering sunbeam shosv'd Before her far a rough and shadowy road. She glanced around, but sasv no cottage nigh. A cross was on the crag ; lier shuddering eye, Turn'd, asve-struck, from the monument of blood, л But stray'd not far, for, bosom'd in tbe луоо(1, 410 > Rear'd o'er a spring, a humble chapel stood. *
No glittering shrine, svith paltry gems disgraced, Or gaudy hues, deform'd its simple taste ; The fount svithin its marble basin play'd, And, gushing downward in a full cascade, CuiTd o'er its pebbly channel, calm and bright, Then leap'd tumultuous from the woodland height ; Huge stones disturb its course, and thickets hide Its humble confluence svith the mightier tide. Above the spring, in spotless stone pourtray'd, 420 Near her grave husband stood the Mother-Maid, While He whose s'oice inspired his Lord foreshesv'd, Pour'd on his head divine the sacred flood ; The opening heaven reveaľd the Dove divine, Beneath, this legend graced the modest shrine : ' e Whoe'er thou art, lone pilgrim, pause and pray, For one like thee, who trod this woodland svay ; But in the fane his holy zeal had plann'd, Fell by a midnight villain's impious hand. This stream, now deeply purpled svith his blood, 430 Ere thou can'st see, shall roll a stainless flood ; And He Immortal, who in mercy gave A holier power of cleansing to the wave, Bids prayers for his salvation breath'd alone, In heaven's bright book be treasur'd for thine own."
" Nor shalt thou lack them, whosoe'er thou art !" Cried the fair wanderer, " 'twere an ingrate's part, To rest me by thy fount, nor ask thy weal ; Hear me for him—yet oh ! with warmer zeal, Hear me, Great Source whence all our blessings spring ! 440 For my loved lord, for England's captive king."— ic Her captive king !" a voice behind began.— Starting she saw a venerable man, In convent cowl ; she fear'd her trust betray' d — " May I not pray," in faltering tones she said, " Albeit in realms where ne'er his virtues shone, For him whose gentle sway has blest my own ?" ic Nay, fear not me, poor youth î but thou hast said The captive monarch—I had mourn'd him dead." t( Dead', reverend father—can'st thou think the foe, Who work'd his death would hide so bold a blow ? Christian or Moslem were too proud to tell, By them the first of English heroes fell."-— " Oh ! Iliad hoped thouhad'st some cause of trust— Nay, I will buy thy frankness if I must. A faithful subject never will betray His Monarch's friend—this cowl of humble gray
Hides the proud Longchamp—thou hast heard my fall, My flight, my dangers—I deserv'd them all. My soul, too high by power unwonted svrought, 460 Forgot the meek humility it taught ; Durham forgot it too, but that is past— His rage is sated—and forgiven—at last— Yet 'mid my countless crimes my faithful zeal Was ever, only, for my Monarch's sveal ; Tell me he lives, that 1 to bim may fly, May ask for pardon at his feet, and die." She rais'd her minstrel cap—her locks of gold O'er her green cloak in bright luxuriance roll'd; a Talk not of death, but live to set him free, 4/0 And know his first, most anxious friend in me," Of all her joys, of all her griefs she spoke, And on their speech the early morning broke. ei Now let us forth ; to Haguenau's towers I go, Where meets th' Imperial Court." " But dost thou knosv," The Prelate said, " in whom thou wouldst confide ! Imperial Henry, with his father's pride, Though green in years, combines the Austrian's guile : Think, should he кполу thee, should some daring wile
Send thee to share that lot thou seek'st to change; 480 Where not a tongue could tell, or hand avenge. Or go, with thine acknowledge rank thy shield, Or safer, in some envoy's train conceal'd :— We, thus disguis'd, through every Gallic ward, May reach thy Norman Peers, and chuse thy guard ; Then as to Henry's court sve boldly come, Rouse to our aid the thundering wrath of Rome." The Queen consents, and svith her reverend guide Track'd, many a sveary mile, the vviading tide. Albert, meanwhile, to shun suspicious eyes, 490 Leaves far the Flemish coast, and courts disguise : France he avoids, and quits his priestly train, By routes distinct th' Imperial States to gain, And meet at Schorndorfs friendly fort again. Fears for his bride, affection for his King, Lent him the ssviftness of the falcon's wing. While near the Rhine he now his course pursued, Through those vast forests of primeval wood ; Hercynian shades, that, like an asvťul cloud, Whole regions darken ssith their sable shroud j 500 Where from their rocky springs the rivers run Their long dark course, and never see the sun ; vol. и. о
Where vales in vain their ample bosoms spread, And lordly mountains lift th' aspiring head, Nor know the dazzling realm their peaks invade. The noontide twilight fades, and long and loud, Ferocious beasts yell dreadful through the wood ; Scarce Albert's heart was firm, and Bernard's breast Is chill'd svith fears, increasing, ill supprest : When full before their way a globe of light, 510 Of crimson flame majestically bright, Sends forth its magic glare î Some hidden cause Their hastening steeds with strong attraction drasvs : Nor svould the Knight resist, he feels the glow, The mystic ardour souls superior know, Tsvinborn of hope and dread, and svildly sweet, That bids them rush uncertain ills to meet ; And long, albeit with natural terrors pale, From airy shapes to draw their midnight veil. " Oh, turn, my master," cried the trembling squire, " Infernal spirits fight that sanguine fire ! Thou know'st me brave,—I never shrunk with fear, From aught that man could threat, or thou could'st dare; But I was warn'd by her лупо gave me breath To shun this forest more than pain or death.
These wilds, where bears and fiercer ruffians prosvl, And stronger, nameless horrors thrill the soul ; Where Druid orgies mock the Name Divine, And human victims heap Irmensul's shrine : Where guilt and fear the avenging kindred shun, 530 And wizards meet for rites that blot the sun ; Lure hapless sv anderers to the fatal svood, Or roam as wolves, to feast on human blood. 1 She told of murder'd forms that ride the gale, Weep in the rain, and in the tempest svail ; Of shrieks and b^vlings—Ha ! dost thou not jee, Where tortured spirits writhe on es T ery tree ? Oh ! 'tis in scenes like these, in such an hour, That sleepless demons knosv their baleful posver ! Turn, turn, while yet our steeds may fly the spell, 540 No eye cau see thy shame, no tongue can tell."— " And think'st thou, Bernard, Honour has no posver In noble breasts, though at the midnight hour ? That I could wear these spurs a monarch gave, And know me base, yet mingle with the brave ? Trust me, if hellish sprites have influence here, 'Tis not on those svho dare, but those svho fear. My head by Heaven's anointed servant blest, The sacred symbol glittering on my breast, о 2
1 mock them all, and would not turn ше now, 550 But for my faith to that ill-omen'd vou. My mission done, if yon red beam invite (And I will court it,) fear to whimper flight." He spoke—his steed obey'd the rein once more, The flame was gone, tbe spell had lost its power. The night was starless and the hour was late, When Albert blew the horn at Schorndorfs gate : In vain the warrior told so great a name, And urged a knight's, a stranger's, pilgrim's claim ; Or hints at mission from the Holy Land :— 560 No gate was loosen'd from its iron band. At length he spoke, " If Theodore be near, fC Tell him that Albert, that his friend is here ; Not thus your youthful Chief would bid me wait, Or bar so long th' inhospitable gate." His Λνο rds at length a surly yeoman bore, And from the revel came young Theodore. Flush'd was his cheek, his eye shone wildly bright, But he with rapture hail'd the ivandering Knight : While compliments and fair excuse he showers, 570 Of dangerous times, and late, unwonted hours, Through many a hall he leads the wondering guest, To where the Baron urged the midnight feast.
With courtesy that pride well knows to wear, lie «eat* bi« tviemi, and calls for choicer fare. Vast was tbe hail, and bright ti. о taper's glow, And large the knightly troop that sate below ; But in each swelling Up and fiery eje Shew'd mere of pride than ruth or courtesy : Loud was their converse, unre^train'd and bold» 580 Of love, of arms, in coarser phrase they told ; And Albert fears their next reply may claim The burning blush of anger, or of shame. Grave was Lord Ulric,—yet no frown represi, Nor angry word rebuked the boisterous jest ; While as the goblet circled 'mid the crowd, The eye grew brighter, and the laugh more loud. Even Albert's brow a gayer aspect wore, At the blythe wit of ardent Theodore ; When thus a youth his fellow squire addrest : 590 u Hugo, to-night, as from the hunt I prest, I pass'd our lovely prisoner's woodland bower,— Beneath the porch she stood, its fairest flower ; Lonely and sad, her tears in silence stole,— Fool that I was ! her sorrow pierced my soul. Think'st thou that if to distant lands I rode, And my bright Maude contending nobles woo'd, о 3
She thus» would lock m\ image in her breast, .\or deem the present lo\er was the best '" ts Soon w lit thou prove her, when on Ь}П<*'ь coa--t, \\ ith our лоишг loid we bia\e the Pa\mm host."— ťí But will he sid ">—no more he longa to rove; He U no ws» his sire suspects his rival-love. The more the Baron's ha^ie, the moie hi^ fuir To leave her in his power, defenceless heie , And, what will both theii ghost-rid fancier fright, The mvstic Beacon re-appear'd to night'"— " Hush ! these are themes we may not speak so neai ; Om hves may answer, should the Baron heat." As Albert hbtening turn*, his glances fall 610 Where, brown with age, a trophy graced the wall The mail was canker'd, but the massy shield Bore a fierce griffin on a crimson field ; And of conflicting thoughts a torturing tram Ruhh'd, like a whirlwind, through his diz/y biam. He rais'd his hand his altcr'd brow to hide, When, while m vain a careless tone he tried, Loid Uhic spoke : ** If to admite," said he, " Be wrong, your pardon for discourtesy, But ne'er beheld I emerald l'ng so bright,— 620 Perchance some token of tiiumphant fight >"
The Knight presents it :— i( If by fortune mine, Baron, thou likest it, and 'tsvere freely thine, But 'tss'as a Mother's gift,—the only trace She left in death to find my name or race." The Chief return'd the ring, nor more inquir'd, Broke up the revel, and in haste retir'd. A thousand fears torment his guilty mind, Nor svas his guest to calmer thought inclin'd. Why on his ring should Schorndorfs Baron dsvell ? And could th' imprUou'd dame be Rosabelle ! The Shield, the Beacon, seem to form a train, All link'd to him by some mysterious chain ! He longs for morn, that Theodore may hear Each strange event, each wild conjecture clear. Grey Bernard now, attendant on the Knight, Told dreadful stories of the forest light. Beloved by all the vassals of his land Was Schorndorfs former lord, brave Hildebrand. Some twenty winters past, he sought alone 640 The morning chace, sithence his fate unknosvn ; But from that eve, svith bright and sanguine beam, Deep in the wood a light was seen to gleam : All gazed in wonder, but the vulgar said, That svhere it shone a murder'd corse svas laid ! o4
Perchance their lord's· !—that flame a warning gave, To guide th' Avenger to the Victim's grave :— To reach the spot bis bravest warriors swore,— The wood they enter'd, but return'd no more. A wife he had,—a dear, an only *on, 650 But soon by prowling ruffians both were gone ; And from the hour Imperial Frederic's hand To Ulric's claim resign'd his brother's land, The light had vanish'd ; and bis vassals fear To name the theme ; they know their lord severe :— He said that Memory could not bear to dwell On the sad fate of those he loved so well. The Squire scarce gone, young Theodore appears ; With oft-reverted glance, like one that fears, Slow step, and finger on his lip imprest— 660 \ While, springing from his couch, his joyful guest > Meets his loved friend, and strains him to his breast,* The youth began, while stroug emotions trace Their quick succession on his changing face. " Albert, for life reciprocally given, Our faith was plighted in the sight of heaven ; By vows on Sylvia's conquer'd ramparts made,'" I come at once to claim and promise aid.
" My Síre, in youth, by lust of glory fired, The future fortunes of his life enquir'd ; 670 The foiest trembled, and these words divine, In flames were murmur'd from Irmensul's shrine : ť Thod shalt bk Schohndorf's Lord, but mark,' it said, ť тнк hour that sees turk ch1ldlkss, sees thkb dead !' A numerous race he own'd ; but all are past, Like summer blossoms,—I remain the last ; And hence, more careful of the double life, He long withheld my eager soul from strife : Now, strange reverse î for Sion's holy land He bids me sail j and, Albert, I withstand ! 680 " I could not stoop to fear a stepdame's reign, And heard with joy his will to wed again ; I hoped that female smiles again might shower, Serener beams on Schorndorfs gloomy tower. He brought his bride ; she scem'd of foreign race, But grief and hate were pictur'd in her face ; What human heart could see her tears unmoved ? Mine paid its tribute,—I beheld and lo\ r ed. I promis'd help, but my returning sire Check'd my imfimsh'd speech, and storm41 in ire. 690
Deep in the wood, sequester'd from my aid, Oh ! can 1 sail and leave the wretched maid ? Nought but his death his purpose can withstand, I am his son—that thought restrains my hand ; But thine is free !"— With horror Albert hears The knell of friendship sounding in his ears ; i( Accursed wretch ! no farther taint the air With words so impious, that I blush to hear ; My heart enshrined thee once,—but Theodore, Spare thy lost friend, and let us meet no more." 700 Upsprung the youth, with sad but eager look He seized the Knight's reluctant hand, and spoke : " Nay, Albert, cast me not in scorn away-*- Think of our mutual deeds in battle fray ; How sve one board, one couch, one danger shared, Hosv oft this hand hath been thy guide, thy guard ; Or hosv thy svords, when resting from our toil, Fell, still I hope, on no ungrateful soil. Yet Fcarcely wean'd from dark Irmensul's shrine, We bow, but coldly, at the Name Divine ; 7Ю And deeds that startle in your happier clime, 'Mid these rude shades were scarcely deem'd a crime. Inur'd from earliest youth to blood and war. To push the spear, or whirl the scythed car,
Scarce stronger bonds unite the sire and child Than bind the tenants of yon sable wild ; And why should mine be dear ? His stern control Check'd each kind feeling of my opening soul ; In his harsh sway my mother droop'd and died,— His pride, not love, my infant wants supplied ; 7^0 My hasvk was kinder ; I was forced to roam, And seek from beasts the kwe denied at home. Thou can'st not tell how hearts, long doom'd to find All they should prize, repulsive and unkind, Cling to a friend—how dear thou svert to mine ! I listen'd, and my soul seem'd svrapt in thine. Behold thy ssvay, the thought that stain'd my heart, Once blamed by thee, for ever shall depart ; I vow to guard his life—but this fair flower, And thou, dear youth ! thou too art in his power. 730 Despise, distrust, detest me if thou svilt, Yet 'tsvas for thee I plunged so deep in guilt ; And, but my father knosvs our fates entwined, I had not lived to thwart his jealous mind. But late I left his side—with smother'd breath He said he fear'd thee, bade me svork thy death. ť Father,' I said, ť if thou my friend destroy, The hour that Albert falls, thy son shall die.'—
ŕ Then perish first, rash fool ľ he madly said, But o*er his brow a livid paleness spread : 740 * The Prophecy ľ he cried, and dropp'd his blade.. Not less the guilt that made him Schorndorfs heir :— Depart at dawn, and oh ! my friend, beware !" He rose, and slowly to the portal crept, Then turned, and fell on Albert's neck, and wept. ťť We meet again, perchance—but jealous eyes Will watch, thy safety then will need disguise ; Thou can'st not feel what weight is at my heart— Coulďst thou forgive me, Albert—ere we part ?" " Alas !" he answer'd, cC plunged so deep in ill,— Hast thou, poor youth, auch kindly feeling still ? Farewell,—thy pardon must be sought from heaven, By my full heart thou wert too soon forgiven." His parting paid, ât dawn the generous Knight Rides from the fort, now hateful to his sight : Yet round the walls, though danger hover near, He still must linger, 'till his train appear j— Meanwhile he purposM , mld the forest shade To seek the guiding light and captive maid. He traced a devious path, now smooth and plain, 76^ Now sunk in wood, and now reveaľd again ;
Yet deeper in the endless groves it wound, And darker, denser, closed the forest round. Gigantic elms, vast sheets of sable pine, With beech, and birch, and knotted oak combine ; And blasted trees, whose branches scorch'd and bare, To fancy's eye terrific semblance svear. The raven croaks above the svarrior's head, And wolves howl dreadful in the dismal shade ; And bears, scarce shrinking from the doubtful day, Stalk through the brakes, and seem to mark their prey. When lo ! enshrined amid the darkest wood, A fairy bower in sweet seclusion stood ! The groves retiring, left a lovely vale Bare to the south, hut screen'd each ruder gale ; And flowers of sweetest scent diffused around, With living gems enamelľd all the ground. The gentian here in heaven's own azure glosvs, The lily pale, and Austria's golden rose ; On this fair scene the moonbeams longest play, 780 The sun enamour'd darts his earliest ray ; And when the woods a sober livery wear, His latest radiance loves to linger there. Low was the bower, through woodbines dimly seen* Sweet eglantine, and ivy's clustered green ;
But jealous care secures th' enchanted ground, Deep trenches guard, and iron spikes surround. By hope and fear, and love's impatience torn, The Knight yet dreads to wind his bugle horn ; When, murmuring from a cell, unseen though near, Soft female accents strike his joyful ear; Oh, love alone- those whisper'd words might hear : " Ela, my keeper grants my suit—once more To see myfriend, the generous Theodore ; Yet little does he deem, by him restored, That my fond bosom trusts to meet its lord. How can this Baron think my faith to move ! Ere Albert sought me I repuls'd his love— But hark ! that horn !" With hurried hand she drew The branches baek, and blest her warrior's view. 800 Who then might paint their eloquence of joy, In speech, in silence, or th' expressive eye ; Yet vainly Albert scann'd the guarded ground, His starting steed refused the dreadful bound. "Oh, tempt it not, sweet Lord!" she cried, " to¬ night My love and prudence shall contrive our flight y At midnight, by his snowy plumage known, Comes Theodore, in silence and alone.
Wear thou the silvery plume, thy sure defence, Prevent th' appointed hour, and bear me hence : 810 The bridge once down, the portal once unbarr'd, Weak is my keepers arm, and slight the guard. But hark to yonder bugle's warning notes, See where on high the bloody banner floats ! My tyrant comes ; oh, shun his jealous eye ! The hateful Ulric—do not speak, but fly." He turn'd, and plunging in the thickest shade, " Ride thou before, my trusty squire," he said, " And to that hamlet where the passes met Bring the white signal ere the daylight set." 820 The knight, meanwhile, whose joyous fancies rove, Lost in delightul dreams of bliss and love That break and knit a thousand times the chain, Drops on his palfrey's neck the careless rein ; Nor mark'd his devious wanderings, till at last An oak's rough branches brush'd him as he past. The sun already sinking in the west, Of time mispent the sickening thought imprest; At every step he marks the fading light, And fate, malicious, seems to urge the night ; 830 While if his steed some fancied track pursued, His hopes deceitful, sunk in denser wood.
Chill darkness reigns, when Io ! with brighter beam, Large and more near, shines forth the mystic flame. Fain would he now repulse the potent spell, And turn his struggling steed to Rosabelle ; But vain the curb, each moment gives it force, He yields at last, and spurs his foaming horse. He follows long, till full before the Knight, Deep in a cavern fix'd the wondrous light ! 840 Sure awful nature in her wildest hour Framed this stupendous monument of power ! Less vast, less splendid, Staffa's vaunted cave, Whose broken pillars chafe the northern wave. White as the spacious vault they bore aloof, Light, slender columns rear the fretted roof; 'Mid the rich spars the mimic flowers appear, And ghastly faces grin grotesquely there : In arches here the rich concretions bend, And bases there to meet their shafts ascend, 850 Thick twined with wreaths of rainbow crystal round, As if some fay the mimic garlands bound. Not long the Beacon stood,—its wondrous light Again leads on, unfolding to his sight New caves, new arches, regular and grand, That mock the pigmy toils of mortal haud :
At length, condensing all its scatter'd fires, The sanguine globe shoots upward and expires. Th' affrighted steed stops short, and hark ! the sound Of roaring streams beneath the hollow ground. 860 The Knight dismounts, but every beam is fled, And deepest darkness gathers round his head : When glimmering torches through the woods appear, And clattering hoofs announce pursuers near. The brightening lights approach, and now they shone On a tall aisle with ivy half o'ergrown : Scarce had he reach'd its shade, when sword in hand Perfidious Bernard leads the treacherous band ; With blazing torch he rushes to the cave, \ " This way he past, nor all his saints can save, 870 > Yet wield your weapons well, my lord is brave !" j He spoke—they gallop'd o'er the cavern floor, Sunk in the hidden gulph, and rose no more. Scarcely the Knight his grateful soul had rais'd To guardian Heaven, when lo ! the Beacon blazed j And stood majestic on a mouldering pile, Embosom'd deep within the vaulted aisle, Where the dark cypress in funereal gloom, Wept o'er the mound that should have been a tomb. VOL. η. ρ
But all uncover'd, on the stone was laid 880 The wasted form, in splendid arms array'd, And yet untouch'd by time, his burnish'd brand Grasp'd in the skeleton's unyielding hand. His crimson shield the griffin's wings display'd, The sable griffin nodded o'er his head. Brave Albert touch'd the ssvord, the rigid clasp Was loosen'd, and he fits it to his grasp ; Admiring, as its ponderous length he sway'd, The jewell'd hilt, the red and fiery blade. But nosv a second, larger band appears, 890 And heavier steeds, and louder shouts he hears ! He turns, he trusts to see the flame expire, But broader, brighter glares the magic fire ; Shoots back its beams from every sparry height, And wraps the warrior in one sheet of light : While as again the fiery sword he raised, The svondrous blade with living lustre blazed. They hurry on, impetuous as the wind, Ulric alone, fierce Ulric lags behind— But svhen they saw the dread, mysterious light, 900 The луеН -known armour of the lifeless Knight, The funeral mound, as if by sudden spell The steeds were stopp'd, the lifted lances fell.
The hoary Seneschal, at Albert's feet (Stung by remorse) drops powerless from his seat : " It is fulfill'd !—my murder'd master's brand Gleams in his injur'd son's vindictive hand ! Albert of Schorndorf— here I saw him bleed— Arise, avenge him—'twas his brother's deed !" " Tis false ! " cried Ulric ; ťí seize the stranger Knight ! What! do ye doubt? then arms shall-prove my right!" But guilt unnerv'd his arm, and Albert sway'd. Strong in his truth, th' hereditary blade. The Baron fell,—when now his comrades bore The lifeless corse of ardent Theodore : The silvery plume the youth to death betray'd, The father's treason reach'd his offspring's head. Sadly they laid him by his parent's side, Who own'd just Heaven's avenging hand, and died. And now the flame dilating, broad and bright, 920 Moves in a pyramid of sanguine light : Wrapp'd in one blaze, in one sad heap were piled The murder'd lord, the brother, and his child ; All night it glow'd, a self-sustaining fire, Till with the dawn th' unearthlyiflames expire. Soon in a temple's consecrated gloom The pious Albert shrined his father's tomb ; p 2
And svhcre to Heaven appeal'd the righteous blood, The cloister rose, the nightly anthem flow'd. 'Twere long to tell svhat Albert now svas told, 930 His father's fate, and Ulric's crimes of old ; Hosv svith her infant son his mother fled, To all unknosvn, the Baron deem'd them dead ; Or how that prophecy, concealed from all Save Theodore, and that grey Seneschal, "When Schorndorfs heir shall wield his father's ssvord, Then shalt thou perish, childless, undeplored." How waked suspicion, and how Bernard sold His honour and his master's life for gold. 'Tsvas night—the lute's soft sound, the trumpet's clang 940 Was heard, the dance had ceas'd, the beakers rang ; With love and joy the antique chambers ring, And merry minstrels touch'd their blythest string, While the full vaults their richest nectar pour'd To Albert's bride, and Schorndorfs new-found lord. The svarder came, i( beneath the castle door Two weary strangers rest and aid implore ; A hoary pilgrim one, sedate and sage, One bears a harp, and seems of tender age."
" Fling wide the gates, and spread the choicest cheer, Our deadliest foe to-night were welcome here," Blythe Albert spoke, and then with gesture bland, Cf Hail ! pilgrims, hail, from Syria's holy strand ! Speak, if perchance your happier speed may bring Tidings of England's host, or England's King?" " Oh, joy unhoped !" the younger stranger cried, Stout Longchamp flung his broad-brimm'd hat aside, While Berengaria, o'er her neck of snosv, Gave her rich locks of burnish'd gold to flosv. Th' astonish'd vassals knelt—with courteous grace, Their Queen uprais'd them in a warm embrace ; Each of the other's fate in haste inquir'd, Nor fail'd the theme, nor mutual wonder tired, Till o'er the zenith night's black coursers flesv, And each glad guest to late repose withdresv.,END OF BOOK XIII,,Ρ о

CŒUR DE LION.,BOOK XIV.,THE IMPERIAL SYNOD. Long years had past since morning rose so bright On Schorndorfs towers, or waken'd hearts so light ; The nightmare-weight of Ulric's rule was gone, And like a sunbeam Albert's virtues shone : But shone not long, to claim their Lord again The reverend Abbots came, and knightly train. One hour of busy grief, one sad fareweil, Were all that love might yield to Rosabelle ; The Queen impatient sees, and hastes to part— Such scene was torture to her suffering heart. 10
Rode proudly forth the princely cavalcade, And plunged undaunted in th' Hercynian shade ; While all around their hope's green livery wore, Exulting in the gloom they fear'd before. Thrice had the evening sooth'd them to repose, Thrice on their early way the morning rose j When on a heath with not one dwelling nigh, Hut, convent, castle, church, to fix the eye, Where each low hill the same dull curve defined And many a chance-worn path perplex'd the mind, 20 The sound of distant drums, and light that play'd On burnish'd arms, a knightly band betray'd. Soon by his gorgeous gonfalon was known The proud arch-priest, Rinaldo of Cologne :* He guards some prisoner—hopes fantastic spring In each glad bosom—'tis indeed the King ί ί( Whence and what are ye, Knights?" the Prelate cried.— <e From England's Regent Queen," the youth replied ; " Before his Peers we hasten to demand Redress and justice from th' Imperial hand ; 30
And pray your gracious pleasure to accord A moment's parley with our captive Lord." e< My leave is yours," Rinaldo then replied. ' f Would Henry brook such leave ?" Count Maynard cried. " Thy master is not mine," Rinaldo said ; " Nor am I here to load a captive's head With fresh dishonour,—but, to justice true, Alike I guard him from his friends, and you.— Escape thou murmurs't—nay, dismiss thy pain, These Knights have honour, and th' attempt were vain, 40 My single sword might quell such scanty train." Some paces back th' obedient guards withdrew, And to his Lord impatient Albert flew : Who o'er his neck his arms in rapture flings ; — Yet not such joy as from despondence springs. For not when first on Acre's walls he stood, Not when on Arsouf's field his mace rain'd blood, Nor when on him th' anointing oil was shed, Such glory brighten'd round the Monarch's head ; As, луЬеп in chains a felon scarce should svear, 50 The rock his couch, and coarse his scanty fare,
He paced Ыь dungeon ; when hi& sickening eye Saw but the gloomy woods, the wint'ry sky, Unchanged save by the varying light, the blast That shook their tops, or clouds that hurried past. A bride despairing—a defenceless host, Perchance his fame aspers' d, his kingdom lost, He felt and bore ; with more than poet's fire, Frequent he swept the long familiar lyre ; Throng'd his scant cell with heroes famed of yore, 60 And cheer'd the gloom with gleams of faiiy lore. Thus, wafted onward by Etesian gales, Up the broad Nile the rapid Canja sails, Steady yet swift, the adverse current braves, And with unerring keel divides the waves ; While he whose hopes are all on fortune cast, Like that same bark, bereft of sails and mast, Floats sidelong down the stream, without a guide, The prey of rocks, the puppet of the tide. " My faithful friend ! amid her dreams of bliss, 70 And prompt release, Hope scarcely whisper'd this ! How fares my realm, my Mother ?—how my host ? Is Sion reseu'd yet, or Acre lost ?"
" Thy Knights," the warrior said, " have sheathed their eager swords, Safe in the truce a generous foe accords ; But Philip's vows were like his sickness, vain, And—oh, my Liege, I grieve to give thee pain ! Thy brother seeks thy crown ; a hand less strong Than thy sage Mother's, might not hold it long." " And let him seize it—'tis my lightest fear, 80 An hour wins back his conquests of a year.* I loved him—hence his power to prove unkind,— Why will he shew a brother's love was blind ? My mother toils and treason has defied, Nor bends with age thou say'st—but my sweet bride ?" Speaking he turn'd, for she, unmark'd though near, Who drank each word with love's attentive ear, Strikes her light harp, and guides the longing eyes Whose anxious fondness pierced her slight disguise. But Albert gazed upon his Monarch's brow, 90*4 (( How will it glad each loyal heart to know ν That thou art found, and thus unchanged by woe Y'y " Aye ! else I ill deserve to wear a crown,— He earns not Fortune's smiles who dreads her frown ;
Insult and torture I might well defy, My only fear was unavenged to die Where none should hear my fate ; but now I fare To meet my trial—nay, that glance forbear : If nought of Roman soul be their's beside, These German Cæsars have a Roman pride ; 100 'Tis much their jealous hatred does not gruâge- A court of Princes and Imperial judge ! But let their petty rage exhaust its skill, My dauntless soul shall prove me England still," The hour drew on,—the squires of Leopold Resign'd the prisoner and rcceiv'd their gold j And Frederic's wily son, who half in fear, And half in transport, found his victim near, (Unlike his Sire, whose greatness veil'd his guilt, And dried with glory's beams the blood he spilt,) 110 Through all his circles bade the summons fly, And urged the moment that he felt too nigh. And now to Haguenau Peers and Primates throng, One thought each heart possess'd, one theme each tongue j But temper some, some policy controll'd, \ One sides with Richard, one with Leopold, ч One Henry's threats seduced, or Philip's gold ; y
One hated England's power, or Richard's fame, Nor came prepared to try, but to condemn. Yet some more nobly thought ;—thy prince, Louvain ! Who mourn'd by Henry's craft a brother slain ; B Maguntium's Primate, and the Saxon pride, 4 Her Lion-Duke, to Richard more allied \ By kindred virtues, than his English bride ; y He of whose race imperial Otho springs, And happy Britain waits her future kings.* The eve of trial came;—the wintry night Hid spires and turrets from the prisoner's sight ; Th' Hercynian mountains, and the silver line Of hovering mist, that traced the nearer Rhine: 130 Yet horses tramp, and trumpets bray'd around, And hammers ring and clamorous shouts resound. Now torches gleam—in vain he strives to throw From his high grate the anxious glance below, Though sure one faithful eye is watching there ; He paced his cell, half breath'd the broken prayer, Or listen'd as the jealous bolts were drawn. With feverish eagerness he longed for dawn,
Or eyed th' untasted meal, svhich ne'er in vain Had svooVl before, or shook his heavy chain : 140 Till, by the rush of svarring thoughts opprest, He flung him on his couch and strove for rest. Sudden the hinges grate,—surprised he rose,— Two strangers entered, and the portals close. Dim burn'd the lamp, but darkness could not hide The one loved form, who flings her harp aside, Springs to his heart, and faints in rapture there ; Her bonnet falls, and loose her golden hair O'er his dark robe in svaving lustre flows, While as again her glistening eyes unclose, 150 She reads in his what grateful wonder glows. Their broken speech tumultuous joy controll'd, Till calm'd at last, the Royal Captive told, How, in his sleep secured with many a chain, His foes had seized and borne him o'er the main ; Yet had his hand their treason half repaid, Prone at his feet Burgundia's Duke he laid, And the black soul in lingering tortures fled. b Next Berengaria, while her dewy eye Shot many a conscious beam of present joy, 160 Told her past griefs : how all bewail'd her lord, As captive first, and then as dead deplor'd.
The Soldan's profter'd truce, the heavenly light That shone to cheer ; her shipsvreck, and her flight. The guidance given by Gortz' unconscious dame, Of Albert's weal, of Longchamp's grief and shame. But now a sigh arous'd the Monarch's ear : " Who then art thou that sitt'st in darkness there ?" ' e One svho has err'd, nor, till by thee forgiven, Dares sue for pardon of offended heaven." 170 ' e My faithful Longchamp ! can'st thou think that I, Who sin so oft, forgiveness svould deny ? Say, was I ss r ont to play so stern a part? Or dost thou deem that sorrosv steels the heart !" With svarmth the King his gladden'd friend em¬ braced, On either cheek his kiss of peace he prest. " If I could grieve o'er memory of the past, This meeting, Longchamp, hosv unlike our last ! I then the Sovereign of tsvo prosperous lands, Girt with such fleets, svith such unrivalľd bands ; 180 And thou the friend, the delegate of one Who osvn'd no prouder prince beneath the sun !

Nay, check that sigh—regrets and shame are vain, Resume thy Seals, and be thyself again f Aside that penance garb must no%v be laid, And Ely's Prelate speak in Albert's aid. Yet sorrow strengthens—should I else have known Thy constancy, dear Longchamp ! or mine own ? 190 And one yet dearer ! ΙιοΛν her fragile form ΒοΛνΉ like the reed, but broke not with the storm ; And well redeem'd the boast of tender pride, In softness bold, indeed a hero's bride ! Oh ! Berengaria, think'st thou not our bliss, When fortune smiles, shall be more rich for this ? But thou hast yet a task j Ι ΙίηοΛν thy zeal With smiles can leave me, if to seek my weal. At dawn my trial comes j—but why so pale ? What can I dread at which thy heart should quail ? They dare not bring me to the block or stake, For angel-guards o'er Heaven's vicegerents wake. Suspense and durance, there I read my doom,— My freedom, dearest ! must be won from Rome. Wait not this solemn farce, this mockery,—go, Ere Maynard's glance the truant minstrel know ; And hark ! 1 hear the outer door unfold,— Here is thy bonnet,—hide those locks of gold.
Wait not to speak, thine accents will betray A heart too full,—my dearest love, away;— 210 Remember, Longchamp, be thyself again !— Minstrel farewell ! I thank thee for thy strain." The Diet met, and purple glory shone Round the vain man who fill'd th' Imperial throne ; And seldom King might boast a nobler band, Primates and princes, Magnates of the land , In wonder gazing on their captive there, His form majestic, and commanding air. d The envoys entered, and with dauntless look The tyrant's seat confronting, Albert spoke. 220 ff From England's Regent Queen, and each that bears A loyal soul, her Prelates and her Peers, We ask—no sign of hostile will foreshewn, Why thus thou hold's t our Monarch from his throne ? And more : from thee, O Cæsar ! we demand Justice on one, a vassal of thy land, The Duke of Austria,—who, against the troth Of men and nations, and his solemn oath Of Christian concord, dared by fraud enchain Our slumbering Sovereign, and in bonds detain." 230 Q 2
" One not" (as Albert ceased the Priest began) (i Sacred alone as monarch or as man, But by that Cross which holy Pandulph gave, To God devoted j and his God shall save." " And I am charged," again the warrior cried, " If his just freedom shall be still denied, From England, Normandy, Guyenne to bring Defiance, battle, till thou yield our King." "Defiance, not from England's strength alone, But every Prince who fills a Christian throne. 240 From all, by Clermont's solemn compact bound, In Holy War to tread the sacred ground, Or guard their absent comrades' lands from scathe, As they reposed upon their comrades' faith ; And more, for every day his Tomb is stain'd By Moslem rites, by brutal scorn profaned, For every martyr's blood, for every harm The faith endures, deprived of Richard's arm, An angry Deity now speaks in me, And claims in wrath the mighty debt from thee." 250 The Prelate spoke, and Henry's cheek of pride, Pale as he listen'd, glow'd when he replied : "Strangers î I chafe not, though your speech be bold; Your Sovereign there, and there my Peers behold :
All that as vassals osvn Imperial sway, The mighty whom these ample states obey. Unheard I judge not, but from Austria's yoke I claim'd her captis'e, and these lords convoke : Be they the umpires ;—but if I shall prove Your King not only svorthless of your love, 260 But all unfit on any rights to call To be his shelter, who has outraged all ; And black with crimes, by Heaven and man abhorr'd, That barbarous states had scrupled to record ; Then, for this care of Europe's general sveal, Your thanks, not censure, shall requite my zeal : Meanwhile, if to this court no cause appear To thwart our gracious svish, remain and hear." ťť Monarch," said Albert, " I my seat demand, As Schorndorfs Lord, and heir of Hildebrand. 27O As such to thee " (he knelt and loos'd his ssvord) " I tender homage as my Suzerain lord ; Saving the faith to England's Monarch osv'd, Forlands and honours by his love bestow'd." Nor Henry dared the proffer'd homage scorn, He loos'd the collar svhich himself had worn, And svhile he fix'd it on his vassal's breast, With svell dissembled joy the you h curest. Q 3
To Ely's Prelate gave an honour'd place, Then spoke with measur'd speech and plausive grace. " Princes and Peers, and Thou, illustrious Thrall ! Fain would I win th' impartial ears of all ; Fain every good and loyal heart incline To feel how painful is this task to mine ; For Kings with livelier sorrow must expose A Monarch's guilt, or mourn a Monarch's woes. Sadly we sympathize, when such are brought, Even like the least, to answer deeds they wrought In wanton power ; but sadder were the time, Should regal mantles prove a shield for crime. 290 " Richard Plantagenet, of England King, Branch of a stock from which myself I spring, Think not a jealous rival seeks thy wrong, That hate misleads, or guile inspires my tongue ; Thy Lion-heart I loved, thy daring deeds, For every pang my kindred bosom bleeds ; And while on thee my heaviest charges fall, 'Tis my first wish thou may'st repel them all. First then I charge thee, King ! that in despite Of my Constantia's claims, and well-known right/
Despite those rights of blood which all respect, And Kings who rule by them should least neglect, Thou did'st compel th' unwilling realm to crown The base-born Tancred on Sicilia's throne, Perchance not William's child, at least no lawfulson. ct And next I charge thee, while affecting zeal For the lost Sepulchre, the Christian weal, That thou, to swell thy greedy posver, hast bent On Christian kings thy mighty armament ; My kinsman Isaac hurl'd from Cyprus' throne, 310 Made his rich spoils thy minions' or thine osvn ; And, as a thousand tales of scandal prove, His daughter's youth abus'd with lassdess love. " And next, that on the day thy single poss'ers, The rest defrauding, seized on Acre's tosvers, Even from the rampart where his valour placed, Thine envious haud my vassal's banner cast ; Him with a btosv, and it with filth disgraced. Oh ! must I speak the hateful truth aloud, And osvn that Austria's flag to such dishonour bow'd !" 'Twas here the Duke upon his captive roll'd Such glance as serpents on the prey they hold : But sunk abash'd beneath the mute reply, The calm, majestic scorn of Richard's eye. q 4
" And more," th' Imperial youth resum'd his tale, " I charge thee King, that still beneath the veil Of zeal and reverence for our Holy Cross, Thy stubborn pride has wrought it shame and loss. Still with new broils the Christian Princes vex'd, Their efforts baffled, and their plans perplex'd ; 330 Till one could brook a vassal's scorn no more, And Gaul's brave Sovereign fled th' unconquer'd shore. 'Tis Thou must answer now for every day That injur'd Sion weeps a Moslem sway ; For loss of all that Philip had subdued, Had saved of Christian, shed of impious blood. " Next, as his Suzerain, I of thee require The price of blood for Conrad, Prince of Tyre ; Whose murder by thy coward hate was plann'd, In midnight darkness slain, and by an unknown hand. ci Next, that the same base treason aims the knife Of lurking villains at Augustus' life ; And he, till now unwont to dream of fear, In every stranger dreads th' assassin near. íť But specious words might gloze these charges past, A seventh remains, the weightiest and the last : That while (despite that pride, which day by day Made half the host but gazers on the fray,)
Still the full current of success roll'd on, T'was thine to stay its course at Ascalon. 350 In servile tasks were noble hands employed, Vainly to raise those svorks the foe destroyed ; While thy smooth speeches almost could incline The Chiefs to impious peace with Saladine. With him ! the Infidel ! in all his state, Still Sultan of the East, and Lord of Salem's fate ' cC Say, Princes ! say, is this the Hero's sword, That sveeping Sion has in dust deplor'd, The ťí Cœur db Lion," who alone could cope With Asia's King 1 the Christian's second hope ! 360 Shall we not strip this Lion's hide, and shesv The subtle fox, the coward sheep below ? And what, though treason brought him to our throne, Shall we not make the cause of man our own ? Or must we fix this monster in his reign, And give this demon back to power again ? f But I transgress : he yet may all deny, Or with prompt wit some fair excuse supply ; Yet, though I knosv his sweet and plausive tongue, I cannot, dare not, hope to find me wrong." 370
He ceased, and Richard hasten'd to reply,— Calm was his mien, but lightning in his eye. His not the pining captive's faded hue, From smother'd rage a livelier crimson grew ; His ample beard and hair's neglected length, Seemed but an earnest of superior strength. With graceful air, yet as in high disdain, Oft as he spoke he waved his cumbrous chain. <f And who shall claim my answer ? who shall bring A King to trial ? who condemn a King ? 380 There is one only court which Kings should fear, A Court Divine—and Thou shalt meet me there ; But by th' anointing oil, the solemn hour That gave my sceptre, I deny thy power ! Oft have I err'd,—and who that looks within, On memory's glass shall find no stain of sin ?— Yet if I e'er misus'd my rule, or them He made my children, let my God condemn ; To Him I here appeal, to Him I trust ; I know hira Good, uor dread to know him Just. 390 Yet, while your haughty summons I deny, For my own irønour, Henry ! I reply. " Me no kind purpose to Messina drove ; In hate I enter'd, though I left in love.
A widow'd sister's freedom to restore, Her massy throne to claim, and regal dower, That ample board, whose golden round might hold Th' Armorie Peers or Paladins of old/ With all the wealth that William's last command Gave to my sire, I sought th' unfriendly land. 400 'Tis true that soon was every doubt dispell'd, And Tancreďs faith my hostile purpose quelľd ; Yet if such concord breed distrust in thee, Why breeds it less to Philip thar to me ? Is't that he urged him to destroy me there?— But the firm youth refus'd, and warn '4 ma of the snare.* " And next at Cyprus, wearied, tempest-tost, What was my welcome on that Christian coast ? Chains to my soldiers, treachery to my Bride, Myself forbad to land, and aid denied ! 410 What were he Anna's spouse, or Manuel's son,— I had not spared him, had he been thine own ! " But for his daughter,—let a Knight beware How with incautious speech he wound the fair ! Nor, save with chaste devotion, breathe a name, Pure as the snow in Cynthia's virgin flame ;
Let Berengaria's matron praises tell The virtues she has known aud loved so well. " And for that rapturous hour, that glorious strife, More worth than thousand years of meaner life, 420 When Acre yielded, when my single powers (Yes, they were single !) storm'd her haughty towers j When England's unassisted might prevail'd, WhereFrance—where Europe and the East had fail'd ! Was I to brook, upon the very day, The very rampart where I forced my way, A meaner flag,—a flag that did not share The glorious toil,—in rival triumph there ? Thou art no warrior, yet perchance are here Some that may hold a warrior's feelings dear. 430 How would thy sire, at princely Milan's fall, Have brook'd an English banner on the wall ? I tore it down—but if it wrought such hate. Why not acknowledge then, or shewn so late Must Conrad's death the poor pretext supply ? \ But 'tis enough,—unless my life belie \ That foulest charge, I stoop not to deny."* y
He paus'd, for Albert rose : ť< Forgive," he said, (( Th' intrusive speech, but svhile I still delay'd On Syria's shore, a svretch before us stood, 440 Whose fiendish soul rejoiced in Conrad's blood ; Sent by th' Assassin Prince he dealt the blow, And with his death confirmed the tale of svoe." ťf Praise to that Power, our guardian and our guide! Praise to the God of Truth !" King Richard caed. " Must I speak more, or melts each charge asvay, Like mountain mists beneath the morning ray ? I have not wrought in shade—a crystal screen Is rear'd the Monarch and his realm between, That not one foible veils from vulgar eyes, 450 But svhile it parts, displays and magnifies. Through such is Philip seen, and thousands knosv 'Tsvas Flanders lured him from his holy vow ; And thousands heard him, ssdien he pledg'd again Those oaths o. friendship, pledged so oft in vain. Yet wherefore broke—the wondrous tale display— Not that my absence left my realm his prey ; He talks of darts which I from Syria's shore \ Could hurl, perchance, or dark Trivallis' tosver ; > Of treacherous swords—but oh ! if such my posver, J
I were a fool to aim no shaft at thee, And live enthrali'd, when such might set me free. " One charge remains—the peace with Saladine,— Was it approved by all, or wholly mine ? Forced ort the Chiefs for interests of my own ; Or broke by me when left to fight alone ? If any doubt my zeal, its truth shall breathe From earth, from heaven, and from the gulfs beneath ; Thanks to that God for whom I all endure, The curse of dying Moslems makes it sure. 470 Whose was the flag that waved on Acre's height ? Whose the red hand that won proud Arsouf's fight ? Or whose the name that routed Islam tears, That Europe boasts, and Asia speaks with tears ? I scorn to vaunt, but oh ! when England's fame, Now dawning bright, shall cast its zenith flame ; When even your cowering Eagles shall attest The Lion's friendship guards their tottering nest ; Then shall· she bid her sons observe on high, Where shine my deeds in scrolls that cannot die. 480 " Now let these Princes, if indeed to them Such power be given, acquit me or condemn. Or if in thy belief I rightly deem The purple paler than the golden gleam,
That Cæsar's sceptre were itself a jest, Did no embroidery deck the Tyrian vest, What is my ransom ? how must I unclose These dainty chains, so fit for noble foes ? Yet mark me, Henry ! Ί thy claim deny, To the last denier, and would sooner die 490 By daily torture in the darkest lair Of dark Trivallis, (if a worse be there,) But I am vow'd to Heaven—my idle sword That heaven rebukes, and England claims her Lord." He ceased; but through the hall loud murmurs ľise, And tears are glistening in unwonted eyes ; h In dread his ransom and his thrall to lose, Preventive of their speech, the Emperor rose, " Hail ! Cœur de Lion !—I with joy receive Thy proud denial, and I will believe. 500 Such be thy ransom as beseems thy fame, As fits with thee to yield, and me to claim ; Ten thousand pounds, each thousand ten times told, Of Cologne weight, and of the purest gold/'' The Emperor paus'd, the Synod stood aghast : fť What King, they thought, " might pay a sum so vast !"
But Richard's soul no mean surprise could move, He knew his England's wealth, his people's love. " It shall be thine, ere yonder sun that now On southern regions sheds his summer glow. 510 Turn from the goat ; yet haply I might fear Some treachery still, for treason brought me here." But ere he ceased the young Louvain arose, Still inly sorrowing o'er his private woes : " Nay, by that ghost which nightly round my bed Demands just vengeance on his murderer's head; May he through whom the deed of death was done, Ne'er for his guilt in penal fires atone ; May this right hand, that never fail'd me yet, In my next field its wonted skill forget ; 520 May thy just fury tear it from my side, If I behold thee wrong'd !" the warrior cried. " May Heaven in righteous judgment deal with me, On its Great Day, as I am true to thee, Thou injured Prince! Heaven's cause is now thine own. I swear !" exclaim'd Rinaldo of Cologne. And rising, all the Magnates of the land Vow'd on their croziers, or their arm'd right hand, To make their Emperor guard the faith he swore, Or yield allegiance to his crown no more.* 530
On their free vows the dauntless King reposed, And Henry parted, and the Council closed. Meanwhile in Palestine the months roll'd on, And Spring dawn'd bright on finish'd Ascalon. Already Albert comes : proclaims with joy, His Sovereign found, and bids them hope him nigh. Now either host the genial year inspires With martial zeal, with rival ardour fires ; Yet who might think, to see the blended train, They once were foes, and shall be foes again ? 540 Arabs with Christians break a harmless lance, To Arab lutes the merry Christians dance ý White mutual presents mutual kindness bound, This gives a hawk, and that returns a hound. Led by the Arabs, now the Knights invade The boar or panther in his native shade ; By Christians taught, the Arabs course the hare, Or mark the falcon wage the fight in air j And when the Christians seek the fierce Castille, Or their light bands in mimic skirmish wheel, 550 The generous Saladine in wonder sees, * f Who may contend with foes whose sportsåre these?" 1 " VOL. II. R
And now, disbiirthen'd of her heaviest cares, In each gay scene the calm Matilda shares ; Evanthe's bloom revives, and joy inspires Gay Hermesind's dark eye with keener fires ; Elate when cail'd the evening dance to lead, Or at the tilt bestow the victor's meed. Once for that envied meed the Knight unknown Knelt at her feet, yet still his vizor down ; 560 O'er his green helm the laurel svreath she thresv, Then as she held the token forth to view, " May this poor glove," she said with winning grace, te Beneath that trophy find an honour'd place, Proof that thy heart, as courteous as 'tis brave, Scorns not her thanks whom thou hast deign'd to save." ic Nay, loveliest work of Nature's master-hand ! My only badge must be this laurel band ; I seiwe a jealous goddess, nor must wear The pledge of mortal maid, however fair j 570 Would'st thou be grateful, wait awhile," he said, " Then weave my shroud for Honour's bridal bed." His voice had sunk, and something stirr'd her mind, Remembrance vague, and terror undefined; But on her cheek indignant blushes burn'd,— To pale Ricardo's trembling gaze she turn'd ;
" Wilt thou redeem me from unwonted scorn ? Shall this poor token on thy casque be worn ? The Knights of old, or false our tales declare, Served honour best when best they serv'd the fair;— I, for my sex's fame, this glove require At the next tilt to waken all thy fire ; So may'st thou tear yon scornful wreath away, And claim the prize, the thanks misplaced to-day." He kiss'd the precious gift, and would have spoke, When on the sports a strange appearance broke j All clad in pilgrim garb a female baud, The palm and ozier cross in either hand. " From distant shores," they cry, " to every shrine We track the weary plains of Palestine j 590 Weep in each spot to pious memory sweet, Kiss each green turf that bore Messiah's feet ; Then let your bounty prove your faith as true, And feed the hungry lips that pray for you." But one of pallid front and lofty mien Sought private audience of Sicilia's Queen ; Her veil thrown back, she stood in silence there : " Whence art thou, gentle friend, and what thy prayer ? " " Are we then both so changed ?" the stranger cries; But at the well-known voice Matilda flies, 600 в 2
" My sister !" and her tears impetuous throng, To deлv the луагт embrace that held them long. But Helen, as she fix'd her anxious gaze, Spoke луШ1 a smile,—a smile of other days ; " What years, Λνΐιαί changes, ah ! what griefs have past, My own Matilda ! since we parted last í I, wont to seek a King's paternal hall, And lead iu spirit as in rank the ball j To shine at jousts the gayest of the gay, Or listen Bertrand's plaintive virelay; 610 (Bewitching dreams, why will ye haunt me yet ? When 'tis my wish, my duty to forget ;} Thou in thy cell, thy heart no sorrow кпелу, Thine eye no tear, save what devotion drew ; While to thy buoyant hope the world unknown, Seemed like that Heaven whence thy young thoughts had flown. Methink this staff and tippet should bc thine ; Thy front's ambrosial Λνι -eath should circle mine !" " Yet I had sorrow too," Matilda cried ; *' That I have borne, I praise a heavenly guide." 620 " Yes ! but thou could'st not madden, day by day, To think thy folly flung thy peace away ;

Is Bertrand here ?" fi Oh no ! ere Autumn's rain, He took a pilgrim's garb, nor comes again." i( 'Tis svell! sve should not meet—but thou may'st say His hatred wrongs my brother—bid him pray Heaven's mercy on that sin, and curse alone The only heart unjust to him—my osvn." " Nay, Helen! Sister ! wherefore feed thy grief?

" Yes ! our pious band Takes but such rest as nature's wants demand. r 3
Of late I bade my princely lord farewell, Then sought my brother in his gloomy cell ; Frank, generous, gay, as in his youth's first hour, Unbent by sorrow, as unspoil'd by power. This parting is my last, and if again We meet on earth, it shall not be in pain ; I pray for peace,—and if in vain I call, 650 I yet shall find it, where 'tis found by all. Thou weep'st again ! yet thine are griefs that break But for a moment the clear placid lake ; While mine are flaws, that scarcely speck the glass, Yet spread and lengthen till they burst its mass. Once more farewell!"—and her white arms are thrown Around Matilda's neck ; she kiss'd her and is gone. The gentle pilgrims still their course pursue, At holy Bethlehem yield observance due, Forbidden Salem's distant towers adore, 660 And trace the winding Jordan's shadowy shore. Diverging now, o'er wide Esdrælon's plain, Jesreel and Nazareth's sacred walls they gain ; Till as by Thabor's lonely base they tread, Tiberias' ample lake before them spread,
Whose fruitful shores perpetual harvests rear, And bid the vine blush purple through the year. Its waves they pass, and on its eastern coast See mountain peaks in stormy chaos tost To Jebel's height, whose rounded summits show 670 The velvet softness of eternal snow. Here, in those wilds where long a Saviour trod, And angel-legions serv'd th' acknowledge God ; Or he who shew'd the coming light, and gave A holy virtue to the simple wave ; Or those the Saints of later times, that fraught With ardent zeal, his great example caught, Here from their kind to rocks and ravens fled, And life sustained with what the desert bred : They kneel at every Cross ; yet shuddering hear Of stripes and fasts, and penance most austere ; Nor covet, while they praise, a glory bought so dear. Now pine-crown'd cliffs meet darkling overhead, Huge stones their path ; beneath, a torrent's bed ; And Helen's feet, unus'd to ways so rude, Miss the smooth rock, or stain the stones with blood. She faints—she grasps a crag—one moment more, And she may sink amid the deafening roar. a 4
Worn like herself, yet form'd of stouter mould, The sister band her sinking frame uphold. 690 No roof is nigh—far distant is the height, Crown'd by the convent they must reach to-night ; But where a Cross surmounts yon beetling brow, That shades the cataract, yawns a cave below ; There may she rest, a sister at her side, Till Anna's Monks send back a surer guide. Low was the arch, but inward as they wound, Say, do the rocks send forth that solemn sound, The Virgin's vesper hymn ? The pious train Repectful paus'd, then rais'd th' accordant strain. 700 The dusky cedars on each chalky brow, The rocks, the caves, the flood that foam'd below, Join the full voice,—from hill to hill it flies, And glen to glen, and stream to stream replies. Still o'er the heights the closing echoes ran, When from the cave appear'd a reverend man ; As towards the train his pious hands were spread, One golden sunbeam touch'd his hoary head. <c The peace of heaven, th' eternal peace that knows .Kor change, nor sorrow, on your duteous brows ! Yet луЬепсе inspired to trace a path so rude ? For, save the mule that brings my weekly food,
The goat, or eagle ou yon craggy height, For months no living thing hath blest my sight." iC As pilgrims we thy solitude invade, A fainting sister craves thy pious aid." Onward he led where Mary's image stood, And a rude'altar bore a Cross as rude : He from the rock had scoop'd the forms divine, And a rough lamp that burn'd before the shrine. 720 A skull and hour-glass spoke of time and death, A scourge of penance ; o'er the wither'd heath, That form'd his couch, a faded scarf he spread, "\ Which had been gorgeous once; (i Approach!" hef said, í And on its folds their senseless load they laid. / (C Our vows, О Hermit ! and the coming eve, Forbid delay ; but in thy charge we leave Our helpless friend. Thou laugh'st at pomp and power, But she was once a kingdom's fairest flower, And nurs'd iu purple ; aid her in her need, 730 For Mary's sake, and to yon convent lead Her steps recovered ; so our prayers shall rise, And win thee wealth in worlds beyond the skies." With ivory crucifix, whose classic taste Mock'd the rude sculpture o'er the altar placed,
He kneels, and on th' unconscious pilgrim throws The torrent's gelid wave—her eyes unclose. " And have I pray'd for death, yet fear to die !" Inly she groan'd,— ťí Oh ! were some Father nigh To hear my parting shrift, to hear and save !" 740 She started up, and glancing round the cave, " Oh blessed Hermit ! if thou art indeed, By heaven commission' d at my utmost need, Attend ! and may a Gracious God bestow ^ One hour of strength !" She bared her livid brow, ъ- íť Not she who nurs'd myyouthwouldknowmenow,^ But I, when English Henry's name was fear'd, Was deem'd his favourite child, and then appear'd As fed on roses, wild with health and bliss— The weight of secret guilt hath made me this!" 750 The Hermit starts, and as he draws more near His open cowl, replies in tone severe : " Yes, Helen ! for upon thy soul shall rest The crimes, th' eternal doom of those who loved thee best." if Have then these deserts breath'd it ? Human ear Yet never heard !—Thou man of faith austere, To thee a dying penitent I sue ; Be just, yet in thy justice gentle too."
" Daughter proceed ! If endless pangs are thine, The lips that doom thee never shall be mine." 760 " 'Tis not thy pity I would seek to move, Or mock thy saintly ears svith tales of love. All Europe knew my Sire—too fond of rule, A kingdom's idol, but Ambition's fool ! Through me fresh schemes of worldly power he plann'd, Pleas'd when the Saxon Henry sought my hand. Warriors, svho named him Lion of the war, Bespoke him brave, and maidens called him fair : The voice of fame his presence soon approved, His worth I honour'd, aad believ'd I loved ; 770 And, save my tender years forbade the band, I then had given an unreluctant hand. —- But there was one, I know not if his lay, His form or valour stole my heart away, Or that my generous brothers held him dear ; For I svas blest but svhen De Born svas near. Profuse, or proud, or rash—let others call These things his faults, I loved him for them all. Thou art impatient, and I svill be brief :— Yet, Hermit, 'tis that I have wrong'd this Chief, 7&0 'Tis that my fancied falsehood warp'd his brain, I thus have pined for years—oh ! is my sorrosv vain ? "—
íť But seeming false !" th' indignant Hennit cried, ίζ Trne to De Born, and yet the Saxon's bride ! Trifle not, daughter ! think how small the sum Of earthly years, to those of pain to come !" " I do not trifle—turn thou not away In scorn—I heard with torture, day by day, Of Bertrand's falsehood—how Amanda's charms, (Turenne's fair daughter) lured him from my arms. I wrote, and no reply—and while my brain With torture reei'd, my father urg'd again The Saxon's suit—indignant phrenzy came To dry my tears ! r He shall not blast my fame Though he have svreck'd my peace ; ncr boast I died, \ Or pined his victim,' stung with rage I cried,— > And the next eve beheld me Henry's bride. ) " Thou groan'st ! O, Father ! but alas ! I seem'd In stupor lost, and ah ! that yet I dream'd! Mirth wanton'd round, yet nought of joy I knew, 800 Nor aught of pain, till, laughing, from Poitou Gay Richard came, and as his hand display'd The fatal scroll, ť A boon ! a boon !' he said 5 s Forgive a loiterer/ and he kiss'd my brow 3 * Though to thy lovesick heart time linger now, As erst to mine when from Alasia barr'd ; I found the means to cheat her wily guard,
And basking in her sight so long denied, Forgot thy tears my selfish stay might chide.' " Seek pardon at the Cross V I cried, and tore 810 The letter from his grasp and ran it o'er. ° ' I cannot hide the grief I feel That thou should'st doubt my truth, my zeal ; But may my soul in torment pine, When absent if I seem to live ; If aught another love could give, Delight me like one word of thine. ' May the fell eagle from on high My falcon on my wrist destroy ; Oh ! may my casque obstruct my sight, 820 My steed nor spur obey nor thong ; Short be my reins, my stirrups long, And I the first to fly in fight. * A captive, coop'd svith those I hate, The scorn of man, the sport of fate, May evil luck my dice pursue ; The wind refuse to swell my sail, My purse be void, my harvests fail, If e'en in thought I prove untrue.
ť May I behold thee courted long, 830 And want the sense to venge the wrong j May porters beat me, may I find No hour to wreak revenge, if they Who swear that I thy trust betray, Are not more false than dice, or wind.' tť Oh God ! each word that spoke of joy and youth, Of martial glee, and fond confiding truth, Proclaim'd me perjur'd, pierced my guilty soul ! But why dilate ? too soon I knew the whole. My fancied foe now reign'd in Périgord, 840 De Born but stayed to give her to her Lord, And grace, as friendship bade, the bridal feast, Which Talleyrand display'd for every guest.* My brother's pitying heart was still the same, His patience sooth'd me, and forbore to blame ; ' And oh !' I pleaded, c by our early years, f By my lost peace, by all these fruitless tears, Since I and Bertrand ne'er must meet again, Let him believe me false, unfeeling, vainj
Think that my worldly soul to Mammon sold, 850 Loved his frank homage less than rank or gold ; het him despise me, for he less will rue, Than thus to find me lost, yet feel me true. And ah ! kind Richard (for I know De Born), Should he by frenzied act, or word of scorn, Insult thy name, or mine, in pity spare,— Think how thy sister wrong'd him, and forbear ; It were a torture yet to dread that those I cherish most, should ever meet as foes.' " " Ail gracious Heaven ! th' astonished fathercried, Λ Was that the cause which tamed the Lion's pride ? > A lamb to Bertrand, fierce to all beside ! j Who knew him best believed it struggling shame, That he had urged thy vows, and conscience made him tame !" " Hermit, they knew him not, and I was wrong ! My fancied wisdom did not cheat me long. I heard how Bertrand's hate our house pursued, Till 'gainst my father's throne his first-born stood, And Richard, when he sought his promis'd bride And rightful dukedom, both so long denied, 870 From his unnatural rage to Philip's aid Was forced to fly, by him at last betray'd.
I knew too late, while writhing with the smart, From my kind Lord to hide ray bleeding heart, To let no sigh my insvard grief betray, And check the tear he still would kiss away; Still in his sight with feign'd delight I smil'd, Alone, my thoughts would madden o'er my child. I might seem blest, yet pining day by day, As flowers decline beneath too svarm a ray ; 880 For poisons may be viewless as the beam, Nor give a colour to the tainted stream. Oh ! had his harshness but excused my woe, Or given one scalding tear pretence to flow ; Of all my pangs his kindness gave the svorst, I was ungrateful, and I felt accurst ! " The stormiest ocean must have rest at last. Years fled—my bitterness of grief svas past ; His worth awaked esteem,—my child grew dear, And how did Richard's glory soothe my ear ! 890 Till he svas captive, and I heard, oh shame ! That Bertrand stamp'd him with a murdei er's name ! "Thou gioan'st again,—but ah ! that night of dread ! I seem'd to die !—a vengeful angel } ed Me, trembling, through the realms of penal flame ; Thousands I saw of yet unsullied fame.
Who writhe for secret guilt, though glory write Their names on brass ; —but most he fix'd my sight On one, a ghastly trunk distain'd with gore, And in his hand his sever'd head he bore. p 900 ** ( Lo ! who was Bertrand once ! frank, loyal, true ; But he with hatred dared the good pursue : Against his Sovereign and his friend conspire, And bade a son in arms affront his sire. He was the tempting fiend, th' Achitophel Who led this second Absalom to hell ; That those whom heaven had join'dhe dared to sever, He bears his guilty head disjoin'd for ever/ ťí I shrunk away,—but wheresoe'er I turn'd, Before me still the dreadful spectre burn'd ; 910 Towards me it seem'd the livid head to hold, The blue lips moved, the flaming eyeballs roll'd ! " ŕ I led my Prince to crime—for that I groan, And heaven is just—but not to me alone ; — Whose soul the burthen of my sins shall bear ? For whom does hell a hotter flame prepare ?' " I see his fiendish laugh—I hear again Those dreadful accents, branded on my brain !— I woke, for nature could endure no more, And fled for peace to Sion's sacred shore. 920 VOL. II, S
Oh ! Father \ is there mercy yet in heaven ? Can I save him, or be myself forgiven ?" But he replies not—on his hands outspread, Veil'd in his cowl, is bow'd his holy head ; They fell—" And does he sleep !" the Pilgrim cried, And drew with angry grasp his hood aside— She shrieks, for ah ! too well she knew the face, Through guilt, and time, and sorrow's deepest trace ; And Bertrand too revived—upon the sand He knelt with kindling look, he seiz'd her hand. 930 " Friend of the wretched ! first to Thee I raise, And Thou shalt read, th' unutterable praise. Oh ! I had deem'd the hour that told me this Had been ray death,—but 'tis o'erwhelming bliss ! I'd rather know myself a wretch, than hold My friend ungrateful, or my mistress cold ;— Helen ! sweet Helen ! oh ! to breathe again That name, nor think thy brightness has a stain !— Load not thy soul with sins another wrought, For heaven were hell, by thy perdition bought. 940 Can sorrow seek relief in crime alone ? My misery was thy work, my guilt my own. And did'st thou think Amanda could subdue This heart ?~yet ah ! i deem'd thee treacherous too.
Thy judgment err'd, our mutual pangs attest The path of truth must ever be the best ; The only path which safe through toil and fear, Leads to the goal, and ends not in a snare.— But thou art faint again ! my zeal transgress'd, Nor saw thy wasted frame had need of rest : 950 Go to that couch ! in years of hope and love, Know'st thou by whom that faded scarf was wove ? The heath is soft, and oh ! may every flower With holiest balm thy wither'd strength restore, And angels soothe thee. When the tempests lour, Such couch is mine,—but now some mountain crest ; There will I pray for blessings on thy rest, Till morning break, and we together raise, With hope renew'd, the strain of prayer and praise." " Stay ! Bertrand, stay ! 'tis but one little hour— I ne'er shall see the flush of morning more ; Thy gentle words have calm'd my burning brain, My strength is ebbing,—'twas the strength of pain. Wilt thou not pray with me, that I may die By thee forgiven, and hoping peace on high ?" " Forgive thee, Helen ! Pray with thee !" he cried, And placed her kneeling by the altar's side ; s 2
" May the pure Virgin never plead for me, If my wot'bt madness svish'd a pang to thee." " Oh, ever kind !" she breath'd—the altar stays Her clasp'd and bloodless hands, her earnest gaze Fix'd on the Cross, her cheek as coldly fair, Her look unchanging as the image there. But Bertrand stood, aloft bis arms svere spread, His penance-faded cheek had lost its red ; But svhen his heart to fame and love beat high, Ne'er had such splendours lighten'd from his eye. (( Thou, holiest Virgin ! Thou, the Sire of Heaven ! Thou, in svhose death man trusts to be forgiven ; And Thou, the Comforter, svho now hast pour'd 980 Thy balsam here, be each and all ador'd !— Behold this kneeling victim, ye svho hear The secret sigh, and see the lonely tear í Such tears, 'tis said, shall quench the scarlet stain, And shall they plead before your throne in s r ain ?

Have heard my groans, have seen me kneeling here, Oh ! let my sorrows never reach your ear ; For me no Saint have sued, no Saviour bled, Ere my least fault be charged on Helen's head. How oft have 1 at highest altars stood, To curse my King, to ask his sacred blood ! Thou heard'st me not, О God ! for that be Thou For ever prais'd : but hear me, hear me now ! Now, when I call thine angel host to shed Their richest unction on his holy head !— 1000 Hc prosper'd in the curse a villain breath'd, Now be his brows with brighter glory wreath'd ; Each tale, by malice forged to blight his fame, Oh ! let it cling but to my guilty name ! Be mine accurs'd, forgot, while day by day, His wins from every sun a brighter ray ! " Father of mercy ! read the grateful zeal That mocks our words, our chasten'd bosoms heal ! Make every wish, each inmost thought thine own ! Lo î we have kiss'd the rod—Thy will be done !"— Awhile he bow'd his head in silent prayer— He rose, his Helen still was kneeling there ; Her glance was upward, on her cheek there shone The calm of holiest joy,—but life was gone. s 3
" This task should not be mine, but it shall prove A sacred sadness, less of grief than love." On her cold breast the crucifix he laid, And wreath'd with virgin flowers her lifeless head ; Chaunts o'er her bier the solemn prayers of death, With voice unfaltering gives the requiem breath ; Then laid her in the grave he meant his osvn, And, as he flung him on the senseless stone : " I had not thought in distant lands to hear Of thy last breath, nor shed a single tear î Is my heart cold before its hour ?" he cried, " Or have my sins the fount of sorrow dried ?"— He thought of other days, while long his bane, For a last struggle pride revived again. " My name dies with me—not a kinsman, none Shall claim my heritage when I am gone. 1030 My brother !—oh ! how vain, how dark, appears All the long discord of our early years; Would I could now what then I sought resign, That life (my life) and all the land svere thine I Hautefort ! thy towers have lost their feudal state, No banner'd throngs are pouring from thy gate ; Thy trophied arms shall be the vulture's nest, And ravens scream where kings were proud to rest ;

Yet there were time to seek for love and fame, To build another race, a fairer name : But no !"—and on his lips there beam'd again, A smile that had no bitterness, no pain ; " My hours are number'd,—nay, 1 must not meet My injur'd friend, and cast me at his feet ; Hope, love, and hatred, all that stirr'd me here, Sleep in this grave !—Oh, slept I svith them there !— Sweet Saint ! *or never unblest spirit shed A smile so heavenly on the lips it fled ; Sweet, sainted Helen ! from thy world of bliss, Look on the wretch still doom'd to crawl in this ; And pray that soon our sever'd fates may join, My griefs sleep here, my soul ascend to thine."— One eve, the faithful mule that brought his food Return'd, unlighten'd of its sveekly load ; And Anna's svondering monks, svho sought the cave, Found him, still strech'd upon his Helen's grave, Lifeless and cold as she that slept beneath.

CŒUR DE LION.,BOOK XV.,THE RETURN OF RICHARD. Thou, Loyal Spirit ! in the noble mind Who dwelľst with all of generous and refined, Thou, svhom a happy realm exults to feel, Source of her public fame, her private sveal; And boasts she gave,—oh, be it long her pride ! — Thy home, svhen banish'd from the svorld beside : Ne'er was thy call svith readier love obey'd, Ne'er at thy shrine svere purer offerings paid, Than ssdien his weeping myriads vied to bring Their several portion, and release their King. 10
The poor his mite, untax'd the Abbot yields' 1 His gold, the lord the produce of his fields : Yet time roll'd on ; and all on Syria's shores, Or svar-vex'd England, count the sveary hours ; For two there were, whose secret treachery strove To render vain a generous nation's love ; Philip of France, and he whose impious ssvord At once assail'd his brother and his Lord. 'Tsvas now at Spires,—for Richakd, as in sport, Was doom'd to follow that capricious court,— 20 Th' Imperial Synod met; from England there, Her envoys half th' expected ransom bear ; The rest ssith willing zeal shall London bring, When her proud gates again enfold their King. The Monarch hails his hour of freedom nigh, And every noble breast is touch'd with joy ; When Henry, rising, svith a gloomy look, Whose fiendish malice wither'd ere he spoke, Two scrolls unfurlV : the first display'd to viesv The Gallic lilies on their lake of blue ; 30 The next—oh ! svhose the rebel hand might dare To fix proud England's regal lions there ? (C From France and England,—for his nobles now To valiant John that kingly name allow,—
Friendship and love these welcome scrolls convey, With liberal proffers ;—wealth for every day We guard our captive ; so may discord cease, b And Europe prosper in the shade of peace. Methinks some short delay, devoid of blame, Our vows may pardon, and their friendship claim." In silence Richard heard the words of guile, His hope sunk low, but scorn enforced the smile ; " Perjur'd and base !" th' indignant Envoys cry, " Restore his ransom, or his chains destroy." When rising with one will, th' Imperial Lords Touch'd their rich croziers or their glittering ssvords : ťí Have we not ssvorn ?" c a voice of thunder says, And Henry shrunk from virtue's angry gaze ; iC Nay ! think not I could let dishonour sway, Delay is all I seek,—a short delay." 50 " Delay, and reign no more !" The echoes round Seemed pleased to double the portentous sound ; When lo, nesv terrors !—Longchamp entering there, Deigns no obeisance to th' Imperial chair ; But briefly greets the Primate of Cologne : <c Now Brother, make this sacred mandate knosvn !" All stood aghast,—but most svas Henry pale, He knesv the golden keys, the Pontiffs seal.
Solemn and slosv Rinaldo then began The dread Anathema, the Holy Ban 60 That breaks allegiance, arms the subject's hand Against his Lord, and spreads o'er all the land Funereal gloom ; svhen closed is every fane, Nor may confession ease the heart of pain. No sacrament is given, nor prayers are said, Nor nuptial rites, nor requiem for the dead, Nor vows baptismal; ec and this Curse shall hold On Cæsar's head, and Austrian Leopold, Till, moved by fear or conscience, they restore The English Richard to his subject shore; 70 And This on Him who seeks his Brother's life, And faithless France, till they forego the strife, Waged in contempt of Clermont's holy lasvs, On one, the Champion of his Saviour's cause. He who for Her nor blood nor wealth has spared, The Church adopts her son, the Church shall guard." Oft had his Sire the Pontiff's power defied, When his ambitious Lords upheld his pride : But Henry stood alone, his crimes arise In ghastly phalanx to his shuddering eyes ; 80 He feels the curse :—he seems already chased From his high throne, and hunted o'er the waste ;
His voice луав hoarse, his brow convulsed with dread, While, torn by avarice and by hate, he said, " Strike off his bonds, and be the Monarch free !— Most noble King, Count Maynard wends with, thee To bring the ransom back ; yet ere thou go, \ Embrace in friendship one whom time may 8Ь.елу у True to thy cause, though late he seem'd thy foe." d у But firm Rinaldo knock' d the chains away, 90 And clasp'd the grateful King; ťf no луеак delay, c 'Twere folly here another hour to waste, A steed awaits thee—Oh ! be wise, and haste." And never when at Easter's festal time He rode to Mass, or in the summer's prime Chased the fleet stag, such train could Henry's pride Command, as rode in Iovo by Richard's side ! 'Twas Christmas, yet December's darkest sky Has beauty to th' enfranchis'd captive's eye ; Her cheerless simvs outshine the blooming spring, 100 Her blasts are ssveeter than the zephyr's sving ; They breathe of liberty : but sweeter yet The Monarch's joy, when at Maguntium met, Unstaid by age, by distance or alarms, His bride and mother clasp'd him in their arms ;
From England one, and one from favouring Rome, Arrived to guide their cherish'd Pilgrim home. Next at Cologne, in her unrivalľd pile, While music breath'd through every spacious aisle, Rinaldo's self the solemn Mass has said, 110 And shared with pious hands the sacred bread ; While the loud Anthem swell'd in choral peal, ct Prais'd be the living God, for now I feel From Herod's hand His Angel saved me ; power, And love, and praise be His for evermore.' *— The Lion Duke, who iu his inmost heart Still mourn'd his Helen, hasten'd to depart, And wept on Richard's breast ; but young Louvain Λ Leads on where Antwerp bounds his rich domain, \ And the broad Scheldt runs foaming to the main. 120 J No idle speed,—while yet his flying bail Gleams in the distance, pursuit loads the gale ; Another hour, nor had his regal home Received the King, nor England known his doom/ But skill'd in all that fits a seaman's care, The open rock to shun, or shallow snare,
Now Trenchemer joys to steer his long-lost lord/ And Sandwich hails him ; thence, by ail ador'd, While myriads weep for rapture, and around Velvet, and gold, and tapestry hide the ground, 130 He hastes to London j 'twas no purchas'd state, No heartless homage of the rich and great, That rais'd the arch of triumph, chas'd the night With one undying blaze of festal light, Beneath the palfrey's feet rich carpets spread, Or from above upon the Monarch's head Shower'd wreaths, that suit his deathless glory moro Than all the flowers which flaunting summer bore. His nobles were not there,—in camp or siege* They fought the combats of their distant liege ; 140 It was his people's love—and myriads throng With shouts of welcome as he rides along. The meanest bondsman had his hour of pride, Who o'er the crowd his tossing plume descried, Thrice blest was he, permitted to behold His gracious smile, or touch his mantle's fold ;,VOL, II.,τ
Now " CtEüR db Lion" sounds, now u Palestine," And not a minstrel wins one cup of wine, That cannot sing brave Richard's deeds of might, in Acre's fall, or Arsouf s glorious fight. 150 Admiring, envying, dark-brow'd Maynard cried, <( Had Cæsar known thy London's wealth and pride, О King ! or how her people held thee dear, Not twice thy ransom would have brought thee here !" s Yet those whose fame disloyal deeds had stain'd, In terror heard the Lion's strength unchain'd ; St. Michael's Castellan, whose power defied A two years siege, but heard him free and died.* Soon his strong arm redeem'd his Norman reign, And made each rebel hold his own again. 160 As through his shires in martial pomp he past, They yielded,—Nottingham resists the last : Prince David, brother to the Scottish crown, Nor martial Durham, might reduce the town. Hark ! to their clarions now the valleys ring, With shouts and clamorous joy they hail the King ; But blind with pride, the traitors madly deem Those raptures feign'd, and nurse their fatal dream,
Till Richard's might is felt h —beneath his power The ramparts yield, and justice claims her hour. 170 But Asia calls the muse ;—she may not dwell On Richard's thousand acts of fame, nor tell How once alone in Sherwood's groves he rode, And met her merry outlaws of the wood. He fought and quell'd their chief, whose bearing told A mind as courteous as his heart was bold ; Nor scorn'd the King to share his sylvan cheer, The river's swans, the forest's fattest deer. And praise the guardians of the rustic scene, An hundred bowmen, gay in Lincoln green.— 180 Nor may she sing of him whose jovial soul And martial spirit lurk'd beneath the cowl ; Her who for love her kinsman's halls forsook, The arrow guided, and the javelin shook ; Fair as the huntress goddess famed of yore, Or Venus, when Diana's robes she wore j— Nor when the outlaw knew his royal guest, How his brave soul its loyal faith profest : Oppression, ruling in the Monarch's stead, Proscribed his name, and drove him to lhe sbadì 1 ; τ 2
Yet had he bravely held the royal wood, And John's stout rebels fled from Robin Hood. 1 Nor how the King, whose wrath his speech disarms, His manly frankness, and Clorinda's charms, Gave his free pardon and his lands &gen, And pardon eke to all his merry men ; So they would bind their scatter'd sheaves anew, And choose them bows of Sherwood's toughest yew, To wage with beasts inglorious war no more, But slay the Moslem hosts on Syria's shore. 200 Nor may she pause on Winton's gorgeous scene, Where Berengaria and the Mother-Queen, And Geoffrey, by his brother pardon'd now, (His loyal aid redeem'd his broken vow ;) Rouen's sage Primate, Erin's, and the might, Of haughty Durham, unexcelľd in fight ; Ely, and Lincoln, with all virtues fraught, Himself a model for the faith he taught; Bold Strigulf-Strongbow, Leicester, Hereford, And Cestria's Palatine, and Richmond's Lord, 210 All throng the ample choir, a splendid train ! While Priests and Vestals raise the solemn strain ; And Richard, great iu honours and renown, With more than former pomp resumes the crown :
And they at Henry's death who loved to tell, " How the sun set, and yet no darkness fell, But a new day rose brighter than the last,"* Exult to see that former dawn surpast. <e And now for Palestine !" the Monarch cries, While sheath'd in arms his subjects round him rise ; Nor did he doubt to bid his yeomen bear The dreadful Crossbow ; though in Christian war The Patriarchs of the Church its use forbade, He might not deem that sage injunction made For those who, struggling in the cause of heaven, Used the best means to human wisdom given.' Now from his Mother's kiss, his Bride's embrace, The tears, the blessings of a loyal race, The hero bursts away, he mounts once more The ruddy galley, and forsakes the shore. 230 But lull'd meanwhile in Hassan's fairy bowers, How sped the youthful Knight's voluptuous hours ? Time glides unfelt, while joy succeeds to joy, Nor care steals in, nor rapture stays to cloy Yet, 'mid unceasing pleasures, Pardo's miad Seeks for a something that it cannot tind ; τ 3
Longs for that dark and solitary hour, When calm reflexion reasserts her power. 'Mid roseate bowers, or citron's fragrant shade, Demands the barren heath, the forest glade; 240 Or that fresh breeze, so purely, keenly cold, That breathes refreshing o J er the mountain svold. Oft conscience to his startled soul would bring A dying mistress, an offended King ; A thouband glorious visions of renosvn, Of conquer'd Turks, and Sion's rescued town ; And oft he rose, resolved to use the posver Which bursts the charm, andfreeshim from thebosver. But ere his trembling lips can breathe the call, He sees Maimoune, and forgets them all. 250 Yet once his guardian Saint so strongly stirr'd The springs of thought, she sung, and sung unheanl ; While round the themes accusing con&cieiice ss'oke, His fancy play'd, scarce sveeting that he spoke. (< What mockery of enchanted sviles is this > No Paradise, although a bower of biisa. The blest can ne'er so deep an. interest know, Yet ask in vain the fate of those below. Perchance dark Hassan not to me has given, Because I spurn' 1 him, such delight in heas en, 260
As those who perish in his svars may share In bowers less green, with houris half as fair." Surpris'd, alarm'd, his beauteous guard appears More fair, more, dangerous through her gushing tears. i( Ah me ! tis sooth that mortals change as soon As sands or waters, or th' inconstant moon ; Unblest the sprite who loves a child of clay, Yet has not passions that like his decay:— Speak ! do these gardens pall upon thine eye, Or is't Maimoune that thou seek'st to fly ?" 270 eC Thee, thee alone í for ne'er my soul resign'd Its trust in Him луЬо died to save mankind ; And but for thee, these grots, this fairy bosver Had scarcely held me one reluctant hour. I blush that thus I staid svhen duty prest t I weep to think thou can'st be aught unblest ! Yet here can aught of angel nature dwell, A murderer's slave, the minister of Hell ? In bliss, alas ! sve cannot meet again, I cannot hope that sve shall meet in pain. 280 Nosv then we part—yet could the scalding tears, Prayer, vigil, toil, the agony of years, Or even шу heart's best blood, thy doom repeal, Not Egypt's hermits, in their holy zeal, Devised such penance as the s e limbs should feel
Nay, sveep not thus, for I must break the spell Which strengthens by delay—Farewell ! Faresvell !" " Oh, pause ! rash youth—one moment—I entreat, And sue immortal, at a mortal's feet. Unblest indeed, since first thy race began ; 290 When, cail'd to bosv before the earliest man, I linger'(i in the fount of life to lave, And drasv new beauties from its svondrous wave. Vainly I hoped his chosen bride to prove, And teach his nesv-born heart to beat with love. Too late I came—th' appointed hour was o'er, And fell svith those that fell to rise no more ; On svhom, from all their natis r e birthright driven, Almighty vengeance shuts the gates of heaven."' Too just thy fear we cannot meet again, 300 Thy doom is bliss, and mine, eternal pain ! Yet spurn me not—my hands are free from blood ; Guilty myself, I yet can love the good. Stern Hassan bade me mould thee to his faith, And give thee back his slave, or back to death ; I spared, I held thee here,—I could not know A heart like thine, and svork its endless svoe. Then force me not to weep thy youth betray'd, To ser thy pangs, yet want the posver to aid ;
Nor amulet can save, nor magic rite, 310 Nor all the Genii, for they fear his might. Oh ! spare thyself—and though thy soul may hate The lost Maimoune, rush not on thy fate." (i That Posver, mild Spirit, which has steeľd my heart, Which stirs svithin me, and exclaims " Depart !" Shall it not guard me ? 'Tis that meek despair, That sigh, that pleading look svhich most I fear. Too soft, too gentle, thou should'st rather rave, And call me false, and drag to Hassan's cave ; But I were svorthless should I nosv remain 320 Aud knosv thee—svhat I svill not speak again. Aud yet shall man, all guilty though he be, Find hope of grace, and is there none for thee ! — Hassan, I call ! Assassin, nosv redeem Thy fatal svord, and burst this witching dream." " What hast thou done Γ she shriek'd—the thunder peal'd, Grots, gardens, groves, and bloomy mountains, eeľd ; They vanish like a cloud,—a lurid light Reveals the lone Elburza's desert height, And Hassan's awful cas r e ;—his leaden eye 330 Beamfe for a moment svith infernal joy.
" Return'd and not convin c'd ! if pleasure fail To bend thy spirit, torture shall prevail : if thy nice taste Elburza's Eden tire, Hence, and enjoy her penal caves of fire," But Pardo heard no more, some force unknosvn Snatch'd from th' assassin's grasp, and whirl'd him on, Till in the midst of Syria's burning sands He dropp'd, half senseless, from Maimoune's hands. iS Alas ! unhappy youth, my power is o'er, 340 Here reigns Demroosh, and I can aid no more ; Saved for an instant, to celestial care I leave thee полу, and Heaven receive thy prayer !" One moment all was heat and dazzling light, The nexl benumbing cold and deepest night ; The morn return'd, and all svas changed again, While fever throbb'd in every burning vein : Nor guide, nor food, nor cooling spring were there,— Resign'd to death he knelt in earnest prayer. " Father of Mercy ! may an erring child 350 Draw thy pure eyes to this abandon'd wild ? How did thy liberal hand its blessings pour ! How have I wasted days that come no more ! Alas ! enraptured to contend with Hell, To my own strength I trusted, aud I fell !
Yet let iny dying lips thy favour move For him svho gave an orphan child his love ; For her whose trusting faith, whose geutle charms Were still remember'd in Maimoune's arms. Ah, for that outcast might I yet implore ! 360 But to thy will I bow me, and adore." Still knelt the warrior, svhen before him stood Hassan, the calm, remorseless man of blood. ' e Lo, I am here ! and dost thou loath my viesv? Thou may'st, for I shall claim the vengeance due : Thou thoughťst to shun me, but the linnet, tyed In silken bondage, has a flight as wide. Know, I have lived beyond the life of man, Yet cannot all my power prolong the span, Unless by deep and frequent draughts renewed, 370 From human veins I drink the living blood. Choose then, my victim or my slave,—obey My darkest, svorst behests,—enlarge my ssvay,— Work midnight murder, drug the deadly bosvl, Knosv me a fiend, yet yield me up thy soul ; Or by that Posver thou fondly calľst divine, Thine instant life shall be the food of mine." iQ Too idly have I work'd His will, in death To hope the glory of a martyr's svreath,
Yet gladly will 1 glut thy brutal thirst, 380 And lingering' perish in a rite accurst," The youth replied, ic if Him whom I adore Be less than God, or vaiu the Cross he bore." He spoke, and kneeling, made the sacred sign, And strong in faith adjured the Name Divine. " Ha ! mock'd again,—but thou art yet my prey, For thou shalt weep thy heart's best blood away." The famish'd locusts strew'd the burning sands, Their wither'd limbs he piled with active hands ; With magic perfumes rous'd a livid flame, 390 And breath'd 'mid words of power Maimoune's name. A cool refreshing breeze, a plaintive air Of wonted sweetness, told the Peri near ; But ah! how changed,—the glance on Pardo thrown, Which mourn'd his pangs, forgetful of her own, Was all which spoke Maimoune ; —Hassan's spell From the wild waste had forced her to his cell. He calľd her perjur'd, bade her then restore \ The reseu'd youth, and cross his will ш morc, ν Or meet the vengeance of infernal power. 4001 Maimoune smiled, u smile almost divine, " Heaven's curse I bear, and shall I shrink from thine ?
Not all the tortures of thine impious art Wound like th' undying fire which wraps my heart." Wild with delight, his horrid Afrits came And tore her lovely limbs with thongs of flame ; She shrunk not, strove not, breathed no plaintive cries, To save those charms for which she lost the skies. To Carmel then her bleeding form he bore, Mock'd by those fiends her beauty aw'd before, 410 Then deep in Kafs eternal ice he rent A dreadful chasm, and there his victim pent; And she, perchance, for ages yet to come, To ruthless winds had wail'd her dreadful doom j But now the sorcerer, with malicious art, Would wring with keener pangs her gentle heart : In thunder told, she knew his hateful will, And cannot shun, though loathing to fulfil. A tear her own worst pangs had fail'd to move, Fell as she gazed upon her earthly love ; 420 And with reluctant, lingering hand disclos'd Where, wrapt in sleep, Amina's form reposed, Weak as she seems, with all a mother's care, Her gentle arms her senseless rival bear. Calm was th' Assassin, but a dreadful joy, A laughing fiend sate mocking in his eye.
" Christian ! whose charm* thy dastard life ensure, Hast thou a spell thy miniou to secure ? Thou seest what pains rebellious genii wait; Can mortal virgin hope a milder fate ? 430 Behold these gems, that treachery's touch proclaim, These talismans, that bear her Prophet's name ; Behold, I break them thus ! and thou shalt call On all thy saints for aid, and curse them all ; Shalt see her glut my rankling malice first, Then waste beside her, waste with want and thirst !" " So lately taught thine impious boasts are vain, inhuman monster ! därest thou threat again ? Blest Champion of my native England, thou That saved thy menaced Sabra, aid me now ! 440 Aid in a virgin's cause !" With vigorous hand The warrior hurl'd the Sorcerer on the sand ; Sternly he grasp'd his throat, nor gave him time To call his fiends, or breathe one magic rhyme, Till the dark spirit fled; the wizard frame Vanish'd in noisome fume, and he became Like those white bones that, bleaching on the waste, Shew where the erring caravan has past. " Great is the Christian's faith !" Maimoune said, And veil'd in mist the thirsty desert fled ; 450
While Pardo rais'd his soul in praise and prayer, Then with a kiss arous'd the sleeping fair. She clapp'd her hands ; " and am I then," she cried, " In these dear deserts, and with thee my guide? Or am I dead, and does thy blessed ghost Rejoin me here ?—for I have mourn'd thee lost." *' Nay, thou fair dreamer ! we must leave behind These cumbrous limbs, ere we can ride the wind ; True, I have dwelt with spirits, been to fame And duty dead, but svear this mortal frame. 460 Alas ! these wastes, that seem so fair to thee, These thirsty sands, that knosv nor spring nor tree, Will make us ghosts coo soon ;—but God is great ! Come svhen it will, луе share one common fate." £i Fear not," she answer'd, ťí I these sands have crost When food and svater, nay our track svas lost, And yet the spring my faithful camel found ; I knosv the desert signs :"—she gazed around, Till hope forsook her eye ; on either hand The smooth horizon touch'd the shoreless sand ; 470 No scatter'd palms of food or shelter tell, No patch of verdure marks the distant svell;
Nor rocky rift was there, nor deep ravine, To hide the hoarded rain, or nurse the niggard green; Nor snake nor lizard, offspring of the day, Nor the long line that marks the beetle's way ; Nought save that spider, God's peculiar care, Sole living thing, that seems to live on air, 0 'Twere joy to hear the shakal now, or meet The dreadful traces of the lion's feet ! 480 All, all is silent, save their quicken'd breath, (The silence and the solitude of death,) Save when around their limbs the hot winds play, As if they marveil'd what obstructs their way. Yet on they roam'd, while still, to stifle fear, To cheat the pangs of thirst, or chase despair, Would Pardo tell of Christians brave and proud, Whose hearts like his to Moslem beauty bow'd ; How Becket's sire in Arab durance lay, His master's daughter broke his chains away, 490 Forsook her faith, her sire, and natal tongue, And from their loves the sainted martyr sprung : Or, how the brother of the English Queen, Loved by the sister of Mirammolin, When died his sire, and rebels seized the throne, Beheld the generous Moor restore his crown ; p
And ohe recounted hosv Almanzor's pride, With stern Seiffeddin, Saladine defied ; And thus anesv her hateful nuptials crost, While svrapp'd in grief she svept her lover lost. 500 And hosv, as late by glowing noon opprest, With lute and voice she sooth'd her sire to rest, Deep stupor came, and all appear'd a void, Till in the svaste she svaked by Pardo's side. She knew not, by Maimoune's spells beguil'd, How her fond father wail'd his dying child ; Drank her last breath, and in his bosom warms The senseless semblance of her faded charms. But thirst consumes them soon, and speech is pain, Scarce may their tottering limbs their weightsustain, While growing torture racks the fever'd brain. A purple haze bespeaks the dread Simoom,— It comes, it wraps them in its scorching gloom ; Speechless they sink,—they raise the mutual eye, Hopeless of aid, yet scarce resign'd to die ; While life, nosv felt but in the seuse of pain, Ebbs from each burning limb and bursting vein. 4 Meanwhile Maimoune in her coral cave Starts at her image pictur'd on the svave ; vol. п. и
ί( Ah, me ! yet I to Heaven atid Hassan Ьолу ' Щ) Those fatal charms—svhat were they to ηκ nosv ? One mortal proves how s'ain each boast I made ; I could not fiv him, and I cannot aid ' Thou, sole memorial of my happier dajs, Companion of ray fall, beloved sa*e ' I svilì not waste thy last unsullied wave, My bleeding brow or burning wounds to lav T e ; Yet when my limbs th' un pitying Afrits smote, My heart approved me, and I felt it not. Oh ι if one deed of good, unstain'd ssith ill, 530 Can yet my breast with aught of sweetness fill, With fiends accurst must I for ever rove, And work the guilt I loathe on those I love ? Thrice happy mortals ! to th' Eternal ear Your veriest svretch may lift his hands in prayer, And know the God that grants not, yet will hear ; But I— í feel the outcast's keenest pain, Who wish the power of good, and wish in vain.— Yet oh, celestial drop ! that still dost shine, As ever conscious of thy source divine ; 540 Since not my guilty touch, my fruitless teais, Nor all th' offences of uncounted уеагч
.)l Have ««pent thy virtue—aid them in their need, And let these tortur'd limbs for ever bleed." She snatch'd the sun-bright vase, and hover'd nigh, Where in each other's arms the lovers lie. Now short and heavy came their panting breath, Their lips are yellow with the crust of death ; But bending from her cloud, her hands of snow Cool their stiff limbs, and bathe each burning brow. Painful and slow, as when distemper'd dreams Have crush'd the m'md, returning reason gleams ; Through their parched veins the languid pulse*- play, And death unwilling yields so fair a prey ; Till now they wake to life, their eyes unclose, With strength renew'd and lighten'd hearts they rose. While, as she flings the precious drops around, Wond'rous to tell, where'er they touch the ground, The thirsty sands a sudden verdure find, And fruits expand, beneath whose golden rind 560 In clear cool streams refreshing juices flow, That speak the sacred waters whence they grow. For ages bent to earth, Maimoune's eyes Sought in spontaneous thankfulness the skies. " Omnipotent ! from one who dare not raise Her hands in Prayer, accept the voice of Ргаьо и 2
She starts ! for in her breast а ронег dh ine Allays its pangs and cm* tr to Saladine !" " Ob, joy unhoped î am 1 permitted still ? I fly, too blest to ss'ork thy gracious svill," — 5/0 Mcansvbile from Pardo's bands Amina quaff'd The juicy melon's sweet and cojiious draught,* When Io ! the pelican—she flies to bring Her young ones svater from the distant spring : (i Behold, my friend !" the Arab virgin cried, (i On ! let us hasten—Alia sends our guide." Soon has she vanish'd from their anxious viesv, But nerved by hope they follosv svhere she flcsv ;— Vast ridges, heaving like the stormy main, Oppose their painful progress, but in vain ; 580 In vain the flying columns round them rise, That precious fruit a wond'rous strength supplies. At length Amina faints : but full in sight, Rise the near palms, her lover bears her weight ; With day's last beam he reach'd the shady well, And staggering, at an Arab's feet he fell. He svoke—'tsvas Aladin that o'er him bent, And Mosul's maids that watch Amina's tent, And Mosul's warriors» that, encamp'd around, Slept by their faithful coursers on the ground. 590
íl Oh!" cried young Pardo, ss-hiie his cheeks attest Shame, hope, and fear, contending in his breast, " Tell me if lises my King ? svhat fates befal Our Christian heroes ?—tell me, tell me all." ri Belies'e me, warrior, that I share thy joy, Thy Monarch lives, and Jaffa hopes him nigh ;— And then forgive mc, if I cannot join Thy grief, that danger threats the Christian line." Brief svere his svords,—the term of truce dresv near, The Soldan bade the Christian host prepare 600 As foes to wait him, or as friends depart ; But the brave Chiefs replied svith joyful heart, iC Bear, Heralds, to your lord these svords again, King Richard lives, King Richard ploughs themain." He calľd his satraps round, and spoke of svar ; But those svhose kingdoms lay dispers'd afar Languished for home, and, as svith one consent, Refused their aid, and left the royal tent. First in revolt the proud Seiffeddin stood, And Sindgiarshah, and Zenghi's youthful blood ; 610 With frequent scrolls in haughty phrase expresr, They v T ex'd the Soldan's scanty hours of rest. и 3
He smiled, disdainful of each rebel foe, Of taunt and threats, and calmly svrote belosv, ki To svhat protector would my subjects dec ? What seeks the Prince who scorns a friend like me ?"· Truth had its force ; to duty all return'd, The proffer'd grace alone S- iffeddin spurn'd : The Soldan wrote, and from an angry heart, " Base and ungrateful, haste Ihee to depart ! 620 Ne'er did I stoop thy friendship to intreat, But tbou hast iick'd the sod beneath my feet ! His realm, his life, to me Seiffeddin owes, I saved him from his subjects and his foes ; And what the succour, what the thanks I gain ? The groans of those that curse his iron reign ; His own ingratitude, his sloth, distrust, And murmurs, rising like the desert dust. Go ! revel on in rapine and in strife, Fear for thy days, and yet provoke the knife, 630 Seek some new rock, beneath whose shade to live, Again offended, í no more forgive." " My sire, alas !" the young narrator cries, re Yet never knesv the Soldan's worth to prize ; With jealous doubt his lofty soul was moved, And him distrusted whom it should have loved.
I then svas distant, but svith all his force, Inflamed, yet troubled, as he held his course, I met him, nor could filial fear restrain ; I urged the Soldan's love, his gentle reign, 640 His posver of vengeance,—but I urged in vain, Cf *' Go, svilling victim !' was my sire's reply, i Caught by the serpent's fascinating eye, Rush on thy doom ;—but I no more will bend,— Go! in his wars thy youthful vigour spend, Till thou shalt rue the shouts that spread thy name, When the quick bosvstring checks too proud a fame.' " But could I stoop to feel so mean a fear, Or think the generous Soldan insincere, When for my truth my parent he forgave, 650 And in a warm embrace uprais'd his slave ? 'Tsvas then the war resumed ;—the Christians ran To meet our arms, and each was more than man ; But numbers girt them round j each hour their host Deplored a hero or a bulwark lost. Now Cesarea falls, the wolves again Expect their feast on Acre's funeral plain ; O'er the young Ascalon a sable cloud Hangs, and her bridal \ T est shall be her shroud. и 4
In s T am their guardians seem in love svith death, 660 In vain their valour mates thy Monarch's wreath, For Jaffa's walls are dust;—nine days her tears May plead with Heaven, but if no aid appears, Pledged to surrender, all our strife is o'er, And Christian.? rule in Palestine no more ; Her warriors must the Soldan's chains endure, — Behold the troops that make his conquest sure !" (S Ah!" groan'd th' afflicted youth, " my force how slight, Yet, if my death might save some worthier knight,— DeareAtadin ! on thee my hopes depend, 670 Am I indeed thy captive, or thy friend ?" Around the Arab's tent the palm trees grew; He culls the dates that seem of richest hue, And shares them with the Knight, and hastes to bring, Pour'd in the melon's rind, the bubbling spring ;— '· Now by the desert bread, and desert wine, Which here we pledge, whate'er thou wilt is thine ; Were it the pearls of Indus to bestow, Or fetch thee ice from Kafs untrodden brow." "Then, if my wish be not beyond thy pt. er, 680 To Jaffa lead me, ere her fatal hour."
" An easy boon, for there my duty lies, And with the dawn we part," the Prince replies. Seven nights have past, another noon is fled, They quit the desert for the forest shade. The young Amina rules a fiery steed, And ever loves the foremost band to lead ; Exults in liberty regain'd at last, Nor shrinks from scorching sun or evening blast. But as the lovers reach a fragrant dell, 690 Why do their cheeks of fond remembrance tell ? And whence that marble obelisk, which rose] Where from its source the conscious fountain fkws ; While as in memory of one rapturous hour, The jasmine wreathes it лукЬ its starry flower ? Above, the arms that Pardo wont to >vield, The helm, the hauberk, and the leopard shield ; — He starts, and blushes with a ruddier shame, At the brief record of his early fame. " Christian or Arab, %vho shall wander here, 700 To youthful virtue give one generous tear. Heaven, that his glory might be all his own, Reveaľd his rank, but kept his race unknown ;
And they on Arsouf ь plain or Acre's tower, \ Who wept his blows or gloried in his power, > Confess'd him born to grace the spurs he wore. y To Cœur de Lion dear, his worth he proved, Who perish'd, seeking for the King hc loved ; And that bright Angel, in celestial flame, \ That consecrates each bold Crusader's fame, /10 > Amid his martyrs blazons Pardo's name." j " Oh ! were it true * oh ' had a glorious death, Had toil, had suffering earn'd the envied svreath ' But svake my soul ! regret and shame are vain, Bright glory hear ! I will be thine again." Thus while he speaks the arms his limbs invest, He shakes the lance and nods tbe waving cre&t ; But in his scarf he wraps the leopard shield,— " There shalt thou slumber, till to farne reveaľd ! Oh ι could I from the woild and memory hide 720 My tainted honour, as I veil thy pride Î" But never yet, in all his past career, Seem'd he so foam'd to kindle love and fear ; For Asia's sun had tinged too fair a face, And time had lent his form a manlier grace ; While round his lips the smile that ever play'd, Temper' d the fire his piercing glance betray'd.
Amina fondly gazed, then svhìsper'd near, While pride and rapture struggled with a tear : " In the wild waste, thou chosen of my heart, 730 By posver supernal join'd, no more we part ! Yet pardon, Christian, if I sometimes feel My friends, my country, sveep thy biting steel ; And svhen with Kings thou wakest the purple svar, Think tliere is one Amina bids thee spare." " Christian, faresvell !" the Persian svarrior cried, Thy truant steps svill need no farther guide ; And let us hold these hours of concord ssveet,— How shall we feel, brave youtii ! svhen next we meet?" " As friends !" svas Pardo's quick reply, " for those Whom honour rules, in heart are never foes ; They not in malice bid the arrosv fly, And fight for fame,—to conquer, not destroy." The evening glosv svas fading into night, When Jaffa's ramparts met their anxious sight. The shatter'd towers, the ruins stresv'd around, The turf defaced and worn, the uesv rais'd mound Spoke of the strife, svhile, from the ramparts roll'd, Its fatal end the yellosv standards told ;
Aud on the farther height (a cho c ?n post), 7*>0 Like a crouch'd lion, camp'd the Moslem host. Yet where, supreme in height, the massy keep Commands the tosvn and awes the chafing deep, Still from the church the glittering cross arose, Still unsubdued St. George's baaner flows ; And the red streamers bid them haste to reach Where a losv postern open'd on the beach. The Christians here their jealous nightwatch hold, But soon at Pardo's voice the gates unfold ; And Albert clasps him, svhile a transient joy 760 Glows in his care-worn face and sunken eye. £i Where hast thou linger'd, tillwe thought thee dead ? Or svhy return'd, my friend ! when hope is fied And infamy is shunn'd but in the grave ?"— " Why ? but to share it, if I cannot save ;— To share their fate for svhom I should have died : —- Ask me no farther now, " the youth replied, " But let me to Matilda's royal care, And gracious counsel, yield this Arab fair." i£ As our best hope, and now alas ! our last, 770 This day the Chiefs proclaim'd a solemn fast, To move offended Heaven—and all our host (That all how few !) save we that guard this post,
Meet in yon fane ; the English Princess shares The general grief, and mingles tears and prayers To change the adverse winds ;—the morrow's sun Must bring our gallant King, or all is gone. The warrior to the throng'd cathedral drew Amina, wondering at a sight so new. Sad was the pomp, for sable clothed around *J&) The ancient walk, and sable hid the ground. Dark, save before the shrine, where tapers beam, And waving censers shed a ghastly gleam On many a martial form that knelt below, Arm'd as for fight, but луогп with toil and woe. White as the novice robes and veil she wore, The silver Cross herself Matilda bore. In mourning vests, and shrunk amid the crowd, Her graceful form with grief and sickness bow'd, Evanthe, late by every eye ador'd, 7&0 Seems hastening to the Sire her tears deplor'd. Before the altar, in the solemn pride Of highest mass, where gold and crimson vied With Tyrian purple, saintly Hubert stands, Swells the loud psalm and lifts his earnest hands :*
<e hora ! in thy Sion now the Heathen reign, Her dwellings raze, her holiest Temple stain ; The blood of saints is pour'd her walls around, Like autumn rain that soaks the thirsty ground ; And none remain to hide with pious care 800 Their limbs from ravenous beasts and fowls of air. They taunt our griefs,—they hold our name in scorn, But sball thy wasting wrath for ever burn ? Look ou our woes, and for thy glory's sake, Forget our sins î Omnipotent ! awake ! c Where is their God ?' the proud blasphemers say ; Oh, stretch thine arm and give thy lightnings way ; Avenge thy servants' blood, thy power proclaim, Chastise the lands that call not on thy name. Oh ! hear the captive's secret sighs, and save 810 The victim, destined to th' untimely grave ! Repay their horrid blasphemies, and shew 'Tis thine Almighty vengeance deals the blow. So we, that are thy people and thy flock, Shall ever clasp thy Truth's eternal ľock; Τα Thee our hymns of peace and gladness raise, And sing from age to age Jehovah's praise."
So pray'd they, deeming in that wretched hour The Psalmist's words had yet the holiest power. Humbled in soul, low sunk each haughty brow, 820 And eyes were wet that never wept till now. At length in silence, for each swelling heart Forbade to speak, the mournful traia depart. Screen'd by a pillar, as his comrades past, Young Pardo watch'd their forms, and follow'd last. For many a friend his eye has sought in vain ! Long might he seek,—they slumber with the slain ! Where now Matilda dried the silent tear, By pious hope sustain'd, and earnest prayer, His knee has prest the ground—she rais'd the Knight And kindly greets th' expected Proselyte. " Weak are the words of man if Heaven deny The grace that saves," was then her meek reply. " Hundreds could strike the rock, but only one Drew forth the stream—yet be my work begun. Nor, damsel, let thy fears suggest that those Around thee now are aliens, strangers, foes,— No ! think that each her dearest blood svould spend To hail thee as a sister and a friend : A sister, link'd by those diviner ties, 840 Whose mystic force regenerate bids us rise,
From the pure svave, combined in bonds of love, One family on earth, joint heirs above.— And Pardo, to my brother's heart so dear, This darksome hour thy glad return shall cheer, A pledge of heavenly grace—oh ! may thy Lord, Like thee lamented, be like thee restored." The morning dasvns, but Richard comes not yet;— Can Heaven its own, its once-loved land forget ? The fated noon draws on, and numbers strain 850 Their fruitless glances o'er th' unspotted main. Ranged in the square the troops already stand, The keys are seen in Henry's trembling hand, (Champagne's young Earl, from Acre cail'd to bear His Uncle's truncheon, and direct the war.) Now groupes of weeping females round them close, And loud upbraidings mingle with their svoes. " Sas T eus !" they cry, " your wives and daughters save, From death, or shame more dreadful than the grave." But they so fierce in battle want reply, ^^^ Nor speak, nor move, save when th' impatient eye > Turns from the Ocean to accuse the sky. j Already shines aloft th' ætherial fire, Inch after inch the lessening shades retire;
The proudest to\vers that flank th' embattled keep ΝοΛν scarce withhold one sunbeam from the deep. " Stay !" Pardo cried, " лл г е have an instant yet !" And climb'd in haste the loftiest minaret ; While thousands watch'd his lessen'd form on high. And hope turn'd sickening from his drooping eye. 870 At length it beam'd—" A sail ! a fleet !" he cried, " See the red flag floats proudly o'er the tide." As when some billow on the troubled deep Swells with a sullen, silent, solemn sweep, At once the dusky mountain breaks, it pours Its sparkling floods of foam, and spreads, and roars. Thus changed the awful stillness of despair To murmur'd sounds of joy, and busy care. Like statue warm'd with life, Champagne's brave lord Flings down the keys, and grasps his shining sword ! Where Saladine leads on his countless force, In peaceful pomp, the Herald stops his course, And tells of Richard nigh.—Great Ayoub's son Mourns for an instant o'er his conquest gone ; Then yields to fate, displays a leader's care, And bids his trumpets sound the note of лл т аг. Rous'd by th' inspiring call the Arabs throng j Flush'd with ηοΛν hope, the Christians pour along.,vol, п.,χ
Sec him, the Emerald Knight, who long had prest A feverish couch, again in armour drest ! 890 And who is she, that like a radiant fay Glides towards the gate, and checks him on his way. " Pause ! though thy heart of adamant deny ^ To li^t thy vizor to a human eye,— > Though deaf to beauty's prayer, to beauty's sigh, j Hear for thyself ! Indeed thou must not go, With wounds half heaľd, to brave so fierce a foe ! Come, let me steal this heavy lance away— Too rash, too eager, ride not forth to day." íť And can'st thou, lovely tempter ! truly deem 900 That I am cold and senseless as I seem ? Yet ill the Knight would merit beauty's smile, Whom even her tear from duty could beguile ; It should be beauty's pride, in honour's track To urge her hero, not to lure him back :— How for thy grace I languish, how thy spell For ever wraps me round, no words can tell !" " Aye ! nor no ear believe," the maid replied, "4 ť< With my first suit, so slight a suit, denied." \ " Nay, by St. James! fair nymph, Hi« not to hide 1 Some face more foul than wizard ever knew— I boast two eyes, and both of hazel hue j
Nay, ladies, when a boy, would call me fair, And wreathe their fingers in my clustering hair. But, for some youthful sin to me 'twas given To love a maid who changed like April's heaven j Now full of promise as its sunniest rnoťn, Now saddening into tears, now dark with scorn ; Hence my rash vow, no more to woman's gaze, In weal or woe this iron front to raise, 920 Till in that hour, when at the altar shewn, By holiest rites I claim her as my own.— Oh, Hermesind ! perchance too high I rate, Duped by fond Hope, thy interest in my fate ; Perchance—yet may I trust that rising flush— Oh ! say not pride or anger prompts the blush, Nor draw that jealous mantle o'er thy cheek,-— Thy looks must answer, if thou wilt not speak. 1 * Yes ! through her heart a crowd of feelings past, The voice, the seeming scorn explain'd at last ; 930 'Twas for her sake he still had shunn'd her eyes To please unknown, to win her in disguise !— She trembled, and her eye a tear betray'd, Joy, shame, remorse, and hope, alternate sway'd. She sigh'd,—the hand he kneeling sought to clasp Drop'd unreluctant in his eager grasp ; x 2
She strove to speak—when lo ! Ricardo near, Meets her rais'd eye, the image of despair : From her bright cheek the crimson ebb'd again, And trembling Coquetry resum'd her reign. 940 " Indeed ! Sir Knight, thyhopeshaveblossom'dsoon ; Unsown at morn, and flourishing at noon ! Hast thou some talisman to charm unseen, Or think'st thou I can love that casque of green ? At thy first sigh forgive a long neglect ?— Rate thyself lower, Knight ! and learn respect." " Unfeeling woman ! trifling to the last, Aye ! to the end,"—he mutter'd as he past. She seiz'd his arm j—he push'd her hand away, Remounts his steed, and gallops to the fray. 950 Too late repentant, self-abased she stood, But with forced smiles resumes her sportive mood. '* Ha ! is it thou, Ricardo ? pid'st thou hear That wayward Knight? 'tis pleasant thou wert near ; Of all our damsels me he treats with scorn ; My glove, forsooth, must not by him be worn, 'Twould taint his honour !—Then the chilling gale Shifts to the south, and sighs and tears prevail j And I may fill poor Honour's place, and then To his new bride he'll lift his helm agen. 960
Whate'er his charms, as high I'd rate my own, Nor wed, like Psyche, e'en a God unknown ; But hear'st thou not, my friend,—when I am nigh, What means that drooping crest and vacant eye ?" " Yes, Hermesind, I heard ! nor can thy smile Again to bliss this breaking heart beguile. How I have loved thee—with a zeal how strong Thou know'st too well, and hast abused too long ; I could not fancy, spite of warning fame, Less than an angel in an angel's frame. 970 To love thee now—or live and love thee not, Exceeds my power, I bow me to my lot ; Yet sometimes—if in other years thou cast A pensive glance on days and feelings past, lf then my memory wake one thought of pain, I shall not live, or love, or di-á in vain." Thus as he spoke he closed his helm, to hide The bitter tears that flow'd in spite of pride. She clasp'd her hands,—and is he also gone, And left her to repent and weep alone ? 980 Oh Hermesind ! not all thy beauty's power Gave thee one joy were worth this wretched hour. The battle raged ; the worn and wasted bands Strive with the chosen of a thousand lands. χ 3
Where in the conquer'd town a temple rose, Its ample nave conceal'd a host of foes ; There Hubert's holy zeal the fight began, Geoffrey, Champagne, and gentle Lusignan ; While in stern order on the Moslem side Frown'd Aladin, Zorayda, Aimahide. 900 Now from the column's shade their arrows fly, Now for close fight their daggers gleam on high ; Tombs, pillars, shrines, their barbarous hands o'erturn, They hurl the craggy stone, the sculptured urn ; The broken saints to earth their votaries bore, And holiest altars float in mingled gore. Nor on the plain where dauntless Raymond f Λ, And Albert's plume is red with Moslem blood, Less raged th' unequal war; each Christian's mind, Fearless of death, devoted and resigned. 1000 Yet may they scarce sustain th* o'erwhelming weight, Another hour, and Richard comes too late ! What power detains him ?— Pardo climbs again A turret's height, and scans th' unruffled main : ťí Oh God ! those ships, that on so proudly bore, Now turn their towering prows and shun the shore ! Alas ! those yellow flags on every post Deceive the King, and Palestine is lost !
Does Heaven indeed forsake us ?"—But he caught, Even as he breath'd despair, th' inspiring thought : iC One hope remains, one only hope," he cried, And from that height plunged headlong in the tide!— Vast луаэ the fall, but mercy deign'd to save,— Unharm'd he rose, and buffets луНЬ. the wav r e ; Redoubled hopes his waning strength supply,— It fails—but lo ! the regal bark is nigh, First in the morn, but now in flight the last ; O'er its steep side his weary arms he cast : ie Turn, Monarch, turn ! thy faithful comrades save !" He spoke, and sunk exhausted in the wave. 1 1020 An hundred arms in instant succour vied, .And snatch'd the fainting hero from the tide. As Richard to his Leach the Knight consign'd, Again the willing vessels court the svind ; (While Princes rush to ply the rapid oar), Crowd all their oanvas, and approach the shore. There slaughter still was rife—by Christians slain Though twice their number load the crimson plain, Fresh foes press on :—but where one Christian died No comrade rush'd to fill the dreadful void. 1030 x4
But two were there, prepared for desperate strife, By native valour and disgust of life. Like somecommission'd scourge, the Knightunknown, 'Mid lanes of felling foes spurs proudly on ', By wounds, by fever drain'd, again he bleeds, But feels it nož, nor gash nor scar he heeds, Urged by a sting he cannot leave behind, The wounded heart, the fever of the mind. Like him Ricardo —long his tortured soul Its martial ardour bow'd to Love's control ; 1040 Fired by despair a ruthless sword he sway'd, And hecatombs might curse th' Iberian maid. Lorenzo, proud the Cronfalon to bear, (Given by the Pontiff to the hero's care,) Waves high its sacred folds, where brightly shone The Golden Keys beneath the triple Crown ; And many a Chief, whom Arab hosts oppress, Feels in its sight an omen of success. Elate with hope young Mirzalis came on, Whose yellow plumes prociaim'd the Soldan's son ; While one firm hand the gorgeous Standard clasp'd, Hid in his left the Ataghan he grasp'd : Lorenzo's heart receives the sudden wound, He yields his precious charge, and bites the ground.
But Ezzeline, of Este's race, whose steed, Train'd to the fight, reveaľd Bayardo's breed ; (While, by no chanfron hid, his forehead bore The milkwhite star that Frontaletto wore)* Flies to revenge his friend. With mighty force The wond'rous steed assaults the Arab's horse ; 1060 His better hand engaged, without a shield, Still scorns the Prince his maiden spoils to yield : Again his dagger gleams,— the courser's eye Receives its fatal point, he rears on high, Breaks through the ranks, impatient of the pain. Then falls and bears his rider to the plain, Ricardo rush'd between, ' ť Almighty Power !" Inly he pray'd, " befriend my closing hour." Swift fall his strokes, the wintry rains less fast ; \ Till sorely prest, the Syrian Prince at last 1070 > Amid the Mam luke troop the Standard cast ; y Then drew his sabre, and by seeming flight Seeks from its rescue to delude the Knight. But on he springs, amid the Arab band, Where now tlie banner graced Zeineddin's hand ;
He seized the staff, his sword with sudden sway Falls on the Prince, and lops his arm away— Just then his side Moheddin's javelin found, The wood breaks short, the steel is in the wound ; In triumph once its glittering folds he waved, 1080 Then fell, envelop'd in the flag he saved. But, watchful of th' event, the Knight Unknown, With vengeful blade pursued the Soldan's son ; · His snow-white Jennet, fleeter than the wind, Cut short his artful flight, he seized behind His victim's casque, and with a mortal wound Divides the throat, then hurls him to the ground. But soon mild pity calms the Spaniard's ire, i£ Fair, valiant youth ! I would not be thy Sire."-— " Then meet his father's friend !" Moheddin cried, (( And be thou here for Saladine defied !" Grief gave the weapon force, the frequent stroke Through his green helmorhigh-wroughtcorselet broke; A thousand colours dance before his sight, And all but courage fails the generous Knight. By mutual wounds their noble coursers slain, They rise and wage the combat on the plain. Th' Iberian's limbs no more their burthen bear, But on his knee he yet maintains the war ;
Victorious to the end, he waves around 1100 His sword—Moheddin feels the mortal wound, Where the stout greaves and polish'd cuirass join : They fall beside the son of Saladine. But hark ! that panic shriek, that rapturous shout ! See from yon temple pours the Moslem rout ! Whose is the prowess whence the foe retires ? Whose, by the terror which his sight inspires ? Whose, by the godlike port and broomy crest ? Whose, by the Lion shield and silken vest ? Triumphant Richard ! not the baleful breath UIO Of the hot pest thus strikes dismay and death ! Where Saladine, sequester'd from the crowd, To meaner hands the cheap success allow'd j Hc hears the shriek, and hastening to enjoy The fancied glory, sees his army fly I " And who the Knight on yonder hill ?" he cried : " The King ! the King !" an hundred tongues replied ; " The King on foot ! then bc this steed of mine Led for his use."—cried generous Saladine." Forth Adel sprang to stop the flying crowd, 11204 " Base slaves ! so late of easy laurels proud, > In danger humble as in council loud ! j
Tum ! if ye love your Soldan's fame," he cries, Turn if ye love the bosvers of Paradise. And thou, oh Mestoc ! in our palace bred, Nurs'd with our sons, and with our dainties fed, Turn for thy faith —that dreadful Giaour defy, * The sun should blush when Mestoc seeks to fly !" But Mestoc said, " go ! bid that mound of slain Arise and fight, and be destroyed again ! 1130 It is a demon, dreadful in his wrath ! Shall autumn's scatter'd leaves obstruct his path ?" "My arms ! my arms !" was now the Soldan's cry, " When fades his glory, Saladine must die." And nosv, perchance by some ignoble hand, The best of Asia's Kings had prest the sand ; But He the Christian's God, whose mercies shower Even on the impious that blaspheme his power, Watch'd o'er his sacred days ; the heavenly will Maimoune feels, and hastens to fulfil : 1140 Yet she, who when to ruthless fiends a slave, Still mix'd with balm the envenom'd cup she gave, In mercy summon'd to a sterner part, Now weeps each pang she gives a father's heart. As the brave Soldan, o'er the death-strewn field Towards England's King his starting steed cornpell'd,
He sees—oh Alia ! 'tis his favourite child, Senseless and pale, with blood and dust defiled ! His Mirzalis, on whom he sought to place The crown that Afdhal's elder brows should grace ! He staggers from his steed, his tearless eyes Fix on the dead, his grief upbraids the skies ; He casts his regal turban to the ground, Or wipes with fruitless care the stiffen'd wound. He shrieks, he raves, he clasps th' unconscious clay, And reason wavers j but the pitying Fay In soothing Lethe steeps the shaft of pain, His eyes grow dim, he sinks upon the slain. Thick crowds are hurrying past—nor foe nor friend Paus'd on the ground one casual glance to bend ; His horse alone (which erst Seiffeddin's heir Had train' d his dangers and his toils to share, Till he at Arsouf, in the hour of need, Gave for the Soldan's use the favourite steed,) Stands o'er his fallen lord ; his Λνίδίηιΐ eye Turn'd to the throng that pass'd regardless by ; Not now exulting in his уеИолу crest, Or burnish'd poitral, but svith head deprest ;
Till Aladin the golden plumage spied : " Poor Safie ! wherefore art thou here ?" he cried. " Oh Adel ! Afdhal ! stay and let them live— Unless their blood these dearer lives could give."— All flew to Saladine, and Adel view'd His senseless form, i( There is no wound, no blood." He loos'd his belt—he felt the living heat Warm in his limbs, his languid temples beat ; íť О, Saladine, my brother and my lord !— Prophet of Islam ! be his life restored !"— But Afdhal o'er his clay-cold brother kneels, While down his cheeks the tear unbidden steals. 1180 tC Thou did'st not love me, Mirzalis I" he said, " But I will weep thy death."--He rais'd his head ι a Poor youth ! may Paradise be closed to me, . If e'er I grudged my father's love for thee." The tide of war rolls near ;—in silent haste On their good steeds each senseless load they placed ; Their camp is fill'd with foes, and like the wind, His flying squadrons leave their chief behind. What roof a shelter to his griefs will give ? Shall he whom myriads ask'd for leave to live, 1090
Even like their Lord whose blood his armies shed, Find not a spot to rest his weary head ? Not so, sad Monarch ! Ramla shall bestow Her ready shelter, and arrest the foe. While there he weeps, the royal drum shall sound, And call again the scatter'd legions round.,END OF BOOK XV.

CŒUR DE LION.,BOOK XVI. THE HOLY SEPULCHRE. Meanwhile in Jaffa's walls what transports glow ' What festal pomp succeeds the pomp of woe í The Christians' hopeless tears to rapture changed, Their King recover'd, and their shame avenged : While he, rejoicing in their zeal, looks on To Sion freed, and laurels yet unwon. The stars are high in heaven, the moon is bright ;— What lonely wanderer seeks the field of fight ? 'Tis Hermesind ! her locks all wildly spread, No mantle wraps her form, no veil her head. 10 v 2
Her's not the soul to shake with idle fear, Yet might a warrior shrink to wander here ; When the pale light in ghastlier horror shew'd Distorted faces, pale, or dark with blood ; When through their tatter'd scarfs the night-wind sighs, When the cold beam reflected from their eyes Gives an unnatural life ; and, feasting nigh, Hark ! to th' hyena's laugh, the shakal's cry ; Or the low groan, the gasp, the rattling breath, Where still some suffering spirit strives with death. 20 And now the rush of wings—her footsteps near, 4 From their dire feast the heavy vultures scare ! ъ. What horrors spread below ?—ah ! look not there. ^7 Her brow is fix'd in anguish, but her eye Gazed on the dead as if on vacancy ; There were but two on all that sanguine plain Whose sight could wring her guilty soul with pain. All day she watch'd—they came not, and the cry Of hope, despair, delight, and victory Fell cold upon her sense. Could conquest cheer 30 Her self-accusing soul, if blood be there ? The slippery field beguiles her hurried tread, She wades in gore, she stumbles o'er the dead.
One wretch, convulsed in nature's latest gasp, Seized her loose robe—she frees her from his clasp, But stops not on his livid brow to gaze, Though well that face was known in happier days. She reached a spot with thicker carnage spread ; There headless trunks and limbs dismember'd laid, Coursers, that perish'd where their masters died, 40 Turbans and sabres, helms of knightly pride, Shields where the bloody Cross dishonour'd shone, And crescents, glittering in the kindred moon. On all she looks, but pauses not, her mind Fix'd upon those she seeks, yet dreads to find ; Pale but unshrinking—lo 1 where yonder beam, From that bright helm awakes an emerald gleam ! She shrieks—her grasp her burning brow comprest, But goading conscience urged severer haste : She sinks beside the Knight; her hurried hands 50 The vizor raise, and loose the helmet's bands ; With patient toil she chafes his lifeless head,— Oh ! is that cheek with mortal paleness spread, One that once mantled in her smile, and took Its form, its colour from her changing look ? Is that closed eye the one that proudly shone, Speaking each thought, nor droop'd but at her frosvn ? ν 3
Those curls—the casque's incessant weight had worn Their auburn beauty, but in youth's gay morn How had she loved (so pride confesses now) 60 Their sunny radiance and luxuriant flow ! She looks, till other years revive again, A flood of tears relieves her burning brain : And see ! upon his breast, like marble cold, Warm as they fall, his languid eyes unfold, Then closed, as if some hateful sight to hide, tl Hence ! let me die in peace," he faintly sigh'd, And give at least my parting thoughts to heaven." 70 " No never, never, till by thee forgiven ; Though here I perish, kneeling at thy side," With broken voice the sobbing maid replied. tc Yet—yet thou liv'st—and if the skill be mine, Which once—nay, wherefore that impatient sign ? If e'er thou loveďst me, do not scorn my aid ;— Thou can'st not wish thy blood upon my head." íť Oh thou fair Syren ! can'st thou yet deceive ? Thou dost but speak, and I again believe ! Yet here thy aid were vain— i know of old The smart of wounds, but now my heart is cold. Yet there is one^—and he may linger still, 80 On youder mound—there, there renew thy skill,—
His blood is heavier on thy soul than mine ; Again those eyes in borrow'd light must shine 1 — What ! can it be so hard once more to feign ? Oh Hermesind ! if it be now a pain, Be it thy penance—soothe his parting hour ; Or should thy cares his fleeting life restore, Confess thy faults, and if he love thee still, Then be thou his, and study all his will. Heaven treat thy wrongs to me, as thou art true 90 To what I charge thee now—Oh, God !—adieu."— Yet still she holds his head,—she lingeis there, Pale as himself, a statue of despair. Again his eyes unclos'd—no word he spoke, But oh ! the pointing hand, th' upbraiding look. " And must I leave thee, ere thine hour be past ?" She hears a sigh, and feels that sigh his last,— Then 'mid the bitter tears that gush'd so fast She sees not where her reckless footsteps tread ; Weak, trembling, pale, she staggers o'er the dead, A voice breathes low—the cold, the sense of pain, Had waked Ricardo from his trance again ; Her whisper'd name arrests her startled ear, *' Oh, once again !—yet can I wish her here?"— γ 4
He sees her at his side—In life's last throe, Can then the soul such heavenly rapture know ? O'er him she bends, her eyes in sorrow swim ; Those precious tears ! and are they shed for him ? O'er his pale brow a sudden crimson past, " Sweet Hermesind, I thought this hour my last, 110 But oh î thou com'st to cheer me and forgive,— How cau I perish, if thou bid'st me live ?" " Live then ! this hour shall Heaven attest my vow, I dare not trust my changing fancies now j Live ! and by holiest ties I pledge me thine ; if not—yon convent is thy grave and mine % There will I o'er my wretched victims moan, Bewail their death, and fit me for my own." She looked, the transient glow had left his cheek, He gazes still, and strives in vain to speak, 120 But to his lips her yielded hand he prest, — A smile proclaims his parting spirit blest. In Ramia' s walls the Soldan's scatter'd powers Meanwhile convene, and throng her narrow towers. The first false daybreak, faintly seen afar, Called to the Mosque the leaders of the war ;
There camphorous torches half dispel the gloom, And all Sabæa fills the spacious dome ; While he whom Asia's thousand thrones obey'd, Wrapp'd in the tarnish'd robes of grief, and laid On a high bier, with funeral white o'erspread, Weeps o'er his slaughter'd child. The Imaums there Awake the Koran's holiest rites of prayer j They laud th' Eternal God, an endless theme, Creator, Ruler, Merciful, Supreme. Blest had they said no more, nor while they own Th' Almighty Sire of Heaven, denied the Son, Nor for the promised Paraclete adored Th' Impostor's name, th' Apostle of the sword ! Now stung with rage, as less by grief subdued, 140 Full in the midst gigantic Adel stood, Completely arm'd, while high his triple plume Like some pale meteor shone amid the gloom. " Enough ! for Mirzalis our tears are shed -, To death and silence let us yield the dead, And wake to vengeance. Gracious Saladine, Shall yon bright sun upon our shame decline ? So many leaves of golden glory past, Shall our stain'd annals write in tears at last,
ť Behold, one Christian lauded, and we fled, 150 While unavenged the seed of Joseph bled !' Forbid it shame, forbid it Him on high, Who holds tb/ eternal scroll of destiny ; And hark ! those clamours—they announce a band Now fresh from Egypt's unexhausted land, Untaught to tremble—wilt thou waste their zeal, Nor prove this fiend accessible to steel ? Oh ! as his impious deeds shall surely shine In Sejjin, record of the wrath divine ? As never he in Eden's streams shall lave, 160 Nor quaff by Alla's throne of Tasnim's wave ; I call to war, and in the Prophet's name I breathe the curse that dooms defeat and shame." He paus'd, and raising high his clenched hand, Cast towards the Christian camp th' opprobrious sand, " The curse of Beder, where the Koreish fled ; Confusion, Death, upon his impious head." b Slow rose the aged Soldan, whelm'd with fate, " See here how little Azraei spares the great ! The dark and narrow home, the simple sjiroud 170 Are all that wait the wealthy and the proud j And let us reap the lesson, taught to know, Perchance his next dread summons calls our foe.
But this frail arm no more the lance may wield— My brother, lead my squadrons to the field." Alraanzor frown'd : i( Upon th 1 accursed tower I fought, I bent before that dreadful Giaour ; Behold this scar ! my turban, ne'er before Profaned with dust, was crimson with my gore 3 Behold this belt ! the pledge of mortal fray,— 180 When next we meet the wolf shall find his prey." i( A stronger claim is mine," Zorayda cries, <c The wrongs which feed a hate that never dies." " And mine," cried Afdhal, " Christian blood shall rain, And orphans' tears embalm my brother slain." But Mcstoc, blushing for his recent flight, Fell prostrate : " Adel, lead us to the fight ! Oh ! Saladme, forgive thy guilty slave ! Wealth, honours, power, to mc thy bounty gave j Rais'd from the dust to stand beside thy throne, 190 What but his life can Mestoc call his own ! That life I here devote j in Alla's eye, And Islam's cause, X vow to kill or die." Fired by new succours, while they thus prepare By one dire blow to end the lingering war,
King Richard views his troops, alarm'd to find That scarce a tenth of those he left behind The sword had spared, and on the onen shore \ Arrays the little band his vessels bore ; \ His kingdom's troubled state allowed no more. 200* Five hundred yeomen ; half could bend the yew, Half bore the cross-bow, and the quarrel drew ; And ten brave knights—yet each himself an host, In later years had been a nation's boast. While there in sport they practise on the plain, Nor deem the routed foe could form again, They mark a thickening cloud, and hear the sound Of distant drums, and steeds that shake the ground. Soon Richard's skilful eye their numbers knew ; Seven thousand strong, and his brave troops how few ! An instant's pause decides—with cheerful air He bids them form th' impenetrable square : The kneeling front a hedge of pikes present, Next o'er their heads the ready archers bent ; Erect behind, the tallest yeomen stand, The dreadful cross-bow charged in every hand. Si Comrades, be firm !" he cries ; " a warrior knows His own desert, nor ever counts his foes ;
Danger is fame ! not always shall belong Wreaths to the swift, nor victory to the strong ; Heaven holds the balance, and at will supplies Wit to the foolish, or confounds the wise. Be fix'd, be motionless ; sustain their shock, Nor wounds must tempt, nor keener taunts provoke : The first that stirs shall die, since he who draws, In private battle, risques the general cause. Expect my word,—no useless javelin cast, Nor on the foe one guiltless arrow waste ; Till from your pikes recoils the startled steed, And death may fly on every slender reed." 230 He spoke ; the weak grew strong, the coward bold, A general shout their cheerful ardour told : They knew their Monarch, and his single might Was more than thousands in the hour of fight. But as the dusty cloud approaches near, And the loud music swells distinct and clear, An Envoy speaks, by Richard heard alone, " While here you ride, Almanzor storms the town !" " Peace! on your life," the prudent King replied : ie Soldiers be firm ! for further aid I ride, 240 But will not linger :"—to his side he calls The knightly ten, and gallops to the walls.
Already on the south the combat raged, And brave Champagne superior force engaged. Where, through the battcr'd svalls they forced before Their bloody svay, again the Arabs pour ; Almanzor heads their fierce assault, nor heeds What dangers threat, or hosv the battle bleeds. Half heaped svithstones, the moat is choaked svith slain, The crumb'ing tosvers a second siege sustain î 250 When Richar», entering by th' unguarded north, Spurs through the tosvn, and leads the Christians forth. Their sally daunts the foe, their shouts confound, And turbans fall, and blood is streaming round 3 While, dreadful as the desert winds that sear The reddening harvest, and defraud the year, He smites the faltering crowd ; his coal-black steed O'er dead and dying bounds with reckless speed, Champs his rich curb, and shakes his glossy mane, Rejoiced to bear his royal load again. 260 Still unrelenting in his fierce advance, Young Hamsa perish'd on his rested lance j He dresv it back, and though at random cast, Through stern Mozaffer's lifted arm it past, And pierced Khorazin. Zulemah beheld His father's fall,—and, firm in grief, impelľd
The heavy spear ; aside the Monarch sprung, And in his courser's woven mail it hung. He rear'd his mace,—that mace svhose iron weight, Studded svith horrid spikes, was instant fate ; 270 Struck with new fear, the youth retires in vain, A shapeless mass he tumbles to the plain. Again the mace was rear'd,— Abdallah nigh, Benumb'd with terror, lost the power to fly : His angel saved him—for the Monarch's eye Fix'd on stout Richmond, svho dismounted stood Against a host, and dyed the field with blood. He seized a Persian charger's golden rein, And hurl'd the startled rider to the plain ; Mounts the brave Earl, then rushes on the band 280 That fell like grass before his mighty hand. Soon, as with undistinguish'd carnage tired, His noble soul a svorthier foe requir'd, Zorayda sasv ;—in vain her lover tried To check her course, and generous Aimahide : Impelľd by fate, or by a woman's pride Tq veil her fears, " No ! no ! to me belong The risk, the fame, and justice makes me strong. Oh thou !" she cried, " in virtue's specious name, Who stabb'st the trusting friend, the virgin's fame,
Richard op England, now for fight prepare, "\ A victim calls, and vengeance guides the spear,"— f " There breathes not one whom Richard ought Γ to fear :" J Firmly he answer'd j when before him stood The blood-red knight of Arsouf s magic wood. For once the ruddy glow his cheek forsook, And in his grasp th* Armorie falchion shook ; " No, not with thee ! for thee my heart has bled, Lost as thou art, thy blood I cannot shed." Zorayda's laugh hysteric burst to hide 300 How conscience strove with hatred and with pride : t{ Ha ! this is well ! 'twere poor to see thee bleed, To see thee tremble is revenge indeed ; The Lion's hide reveals the Hart below, And Cœur de Lion fears—a female foe !" ct Hence, hence from honour's field !" the King replied, " Hence ! in the harem's secret chambers hide ; False to thy God, apostate to thy sex, Go, where thy sight no Christian eye may vex. What though thou know'st that, true to knighthood's vow, 310 ï will not write thy guilt upon thy brow,
Dread, lest again th' offended skies should flame, And Heaven's red bolt bear witness of thy shame." She strove for speech, but Aladin detains Her gentle steed, her rash design arraigns : 4i Not for my sake, but for thine own, retire ; His skill, his strength, a manly arm require. Cold as thou art, to me this fight belongs— The slave at least may feel his lady's wrongs." His generous zeal the Monarch's pity di asvs ; 320 te Brave youth ! thy svorth deserves a better cause." Rejoiced, he saw Almanzor's headlong speed Before the Prince impel his snorting steed. " Turn, braggart ! less than woman, turn ! for now My jewel blushes on thy recreant brosv. Turn, 'tis a fight which thou art sworn to bide." " And one I would not shun," the King replied. Now here, now there the svell taught chargers wheel ; The helmets ring and gleams the azure steel ; But Richard, as in martial pastime cool, 330 Prevents th' intended stroke, and fights by rule : While, urged by wounded pride, his fiercer foe, Intent to give, forgets to ward the blow, And bleeds at many a wound. Not oft avail His deadly thrusts to pierce the Norman mail ;,\ r OL. II.,ζ
While Caliburn, where'er its edge descends, Divides the buckler and the corselet rends ; Yet, with each wound Almanzor's fury grows, And swift and swifter fall his deafening blows. Long hung the doubtful fight, till Richard's mind, Oft wandering to the band he left behind, Impels th' impatient steel ; the Arab's vest Receives the blow, it pierced his mighty chest. Inly he bleeds ; his waning strength he feels ; Before his eyes the fading landscape reels ; Yet either hand the dreadful sabre bore, Despair and torture prompt one effort more, Where o'er the Monarch's pliant hauberk rolľd, On his rich scarf the lion grins in gold : But Richard leap'd aside—the mighty thrust 350 Baulk'd of its aim, Almanzor bites the dust. Brave Pardo mark'd his fall ; in thought he bears Amina's shrieks, and sees her flowing tears ; While the fierce King the sorrowing Arabs chaeed, Their dying leader on his steed he placed, And bore to Jaffa's walls ; but dares not stay To kiss the flood of filial grief away : Once more he gives his eager roan the rein, And breathing war, he gallops to the plain.
He meets Zorayda, lost in troubled thought, 360 Not nosv, as late among the first she fought ; But mused apart—'* If with no braver Knight Engaged to meet, tbou shun'st promiscuous fight, Here let our swords our mutual prowess prove, And try the combat for our ladies' kwe." " Behold my mistress here ! " she fiercely said, And rais'd her shield : it bore the Gorgon's head. " Would it could turn thy hated race to stone : Revenge and hate are all the loves I osvn. But svords are vain ; What stripling he, svho dares To brave that arm which Cœur de Lion fears ? Thy mien is noble ; but that ample shield- Has treason stain'd its badge, or why conceal'd ? " ťí And would'st thou, warrior ! of my birth inquire ? The Church my mother, and this sword my sire; I knesv no parent's care ; this shield alone— But no ! 1 would not it should make me known, Till the first Priuce might svish me for his own. Aud for the rest—these spurs a Monarch gave, A proof he loved me, and believed me brave. 380 For thee, thy speech and arms betray that those With whom thou combat'st, should have been thy foes; z 2
But I inquire not, lest thy lips declare A name some noble race might blush to hear. **" Presumptuous boy ! " she said, " methinks thy tongue Should be less bold, unless thy lance be strong." They wheeľd around, and met in short career, Backward he bent beneath her powerful spear ; But his light lance has broken on her shield- Taunting she flung the fragments on the field. 390 " 'Tis well, stout champion !—■ next thy sword should shew If aught but words bc thine to wound a foe." íť Nay, courteous Knight ! behold its azure sheen, I would not that my wit were half so keen." They closed in fight, Zorayda fought with all A warrior's strength, and more than warrior's gall. For woman, when she bursts the bounds assign'd By Heaven and nature, no restraints can bind ; As some fair garden, should its fence decay, Becomes to wolves and ravenous birds a prey, 400 Fruits fade and flowers, while weeds accurst and vile, With rampant vigour choke the fruitful soil. Thus droop the Virtues, thus, without control, All the feil Furies riot in her soul.
But Pardo, proud of his excelling skill, Proud of a steed that seem'd to guess his will, Wheels here and there ; each 1алуГи1 vantage took, And now eludes, and now prevents the stroke ; Nor fought by knighthood's strictest laws alone, But gave to combat graces all his own. 410 Alas ! his soul is buoyant with delight j Nor sees where laughing demons watch the fight, Nor deems he soon shall curse that fatal hour, And, lost in grief, bewail his falchion's power. Zorayda maddening to be thus withstood, And madder yet to see her flowing blood, With hasty impulse waves her weapon round, And his unguarded knee receives the wound. Slight was the hurt; but, at th' unknightly blow His anger rose ; he rushes on the foe. 420 While her fierce charge his lifted buckler bore, Beneath the heart his луеароп drinks her gore, And from her steed she sinks, to rise no more. Buton inclement Thule's лл -ondrous coast, When high to Heaven the steamy jets are tost, Not swifter, when the hidden fires subside, Within its basin sinks the calm clear tide, Than Pardo's burst of sudden fury died. z 3
He kneels uesìde her : " Warrior ! 'tis the hour When earthly things should fix the soul no more, 430 And Mercy, pointing to her native Heaven, Bids us forgive, that we may be forgiven. Perchance thy soul in secret holds her faith ; 4 Still pious rites may soothe the pangs of death, ъ And Holy Church receive thy parting breath." * She heeds not, but in either trembling hand, With shorten'd hold she grasps her shining brand ; In haste he rais'd his shield,—with feeble sway The treacherous blow but rent its veil away, And a broad burst of brighter light reveaľd 440 The spotted Pard upon its azure field. He points his sword; " 'T were madness now to spare." But with a thrilling shriek, she cries " Forbear ! " And senseless sunk,—it seem'd her latest gasp ; His pitying hands her tight-drawn heim unclasp, While, from their net of gems and gold uabouud, Her long black tresses flow'd upon the ground. He props her on his knee, amazed to trace The softer moulding of a female face, Whence hate's unnatural scowl had parted now, 450 Though death and horror bathe her livid brow*
Breathes she no more? «ah yes! her labouring breast By »tarts the throe of inward pain confest, The crimson flush'd and flitted on her cheek, There is some grief she would, but cannot speak ; Death claims her soul, and yet it will not part Till that dread secret, ease her bursting heart— ťí Relentless Heaven! it waits but for a time That sterner justice may o'ertake the crime. Thus should my tainted blood indeed be spilt,— 460 Thus by my Child—the offspring of my guilt."— " What words are these ?" he cried, " Oh I speak Kíígain ! Or let me think them phrenzied dreams of pain. Great God ! on either side is madness now— Speak, if thou can'st—who am I ? who art thou ?" ie Let me embrace thee first, and on thee cast A mother's gaze—my earliest and ray last. Nay! look not thus—what though thy hands be red, 'Tis by my guilt that now my blood is shed,— I scofFd—I would have braved it to the end ; 470 But vengeance rules, and even I must bend. No more of my dishonour'd race inquire, Suffice, an English Monarch was thy sire. z 4
My parents bade him train me up in truth, He should have guarded, he abused my youth ; That crime be his—'twas mine my guilt to hide, Bound as I was, his son's contracted bride, I listen'd vows that injur'd son preferr'd ; I knew them impious, yet I heard, I heard,— And when his breaking heart, my falsehood knosvn, \ Forbore reproach, intent to veil alone > My shame, and save my honour by his osvn, j My hate pursued him— but the die is cast ; Once warn'd—th' avenging bolt has fall'n at last." " Fall'n, fall'n indeed,"—a well knosvn tongue, re¬ plied. 'Twas Cœur de Lion, sveeping by her side. " Oh lost Alasia !—nay, one instant hear, For thine eternal weal, a voice once dear. I come not one reproving glance to cast, Oh ! think not on this life, for that is past,— 490 What are our passions in the silent home ? What all this little world to that to come ?"— " Forbear, forbear !" she sternly cried, again Her spirit rising over death and pain ; '* There are but two whose eye my soul svould shun, Whose bight could vex in death—and thou art one.
I want no counsel, and could not unveil To some dull priest my circumstantial tale, That he may give, at lost Alasia's name, With wink and shrug a royal house to shame, 5C0 And boast how all upon this changing scene Meet sin and judgment—I, by birth a Queen ! c And if I cannot, like some Sovereigns, kneel ά To pale-faced monks for stripes I scorn to feel, Still less I deem that prayers in dying hour, Or priestly pardons, have salvation's power. Curse on such arts—and curse on those who live In watching pangs for which they feign to grieve : Hence !—she nosv mistress svhere I once was dear, May chide those drops so idly lavish'd here— 510 If I have lived unworthy of my sire, Worthy of both my lovers I expire, The interdicted King—the parricide,— Oh ! start not thus, my child, my child," she cried. ' r That fatal word—it-was not meant for thee,— Thy hands are guilty, but thy soul is free. Oh ! I am faint—th' avenging skies that gave Years undesired, deny the hour I crave ; But justice, when it bids my ghost endure Its doom of torment, shall proclaim thee pure,— 520
Abandon'd, sought so long, and known too late,— It was not thou that seal'd Alasia's fate." Around his цеск she huug, to hide the strife, The last convulsion of contending life ; Nor sigh nor groan her parting tortures tell, Till in his arms a senseless load she fell. " Oh dreadful end !" the shuddering Monarch cried, " Unhallow'd hour !" the weeping son replied. But prest no more by Richard's arm of might The Moslems rally and renew the fight, 530 " Rest here, poor youth, and ease thy bursting heart, Mine is a warrior's and a Monarch's part." He said, his vizor o'er his face he drew, And on the foe with double fury flew. But Pardo, deaf to all that once had charms, The shrill voiced trumpet, and the clang of arms, Regardless now of who might win or die, Lost in that grief that knows nor tear nor sigh, Gazeď on the form that still his arms enfold, Pale as herself, as motionless, as cold. 540 Till speaking loud in grief and wonder near, A well known voice arous*d his startled ear. " And have I sought thee o'er the plain," it crjed, " To find thee thus, the dark Destroyer's bride?—
Pardo— I will not linger now, to know Λ Why thou usurp'st my privilege of woe, J* But, by thy Knighthood, who has struck the blow?"^ " One> who to save her should have welcom'd death, Her child has pierc'd the mould that gave him breath." (l Her Child !" cried Aladin, with mantling brow^— Zorayda's Child !—but that is nothing now : Where lurks the monster, that my hands may tear And' give him piecemeal to the fowls of air ?" " Oh ! but for one sad duty to fulfil, And one sweet flower that clings around me still, How gladly would I rush upon thy sword, And lose at once a being—now abhorr'd : Prince— în a parent's precious gore embrued, Ne'er shall this steel be wet with other blood : A mournful relic to my latest hour— 560 Spare then, or strike me, I am in thy power." The Prince a moment paus'd—a deathlike dew Suffused his frame, and hoarse his accents grew.— ** No ! no ! I strike not him who shared my bread, For one—but let our thoughts respect the dead ! If thou art guilty, live ! thy curse is life— If error struck, I have no cause of strife.
Fulfil the mournful rites, I could not bear To view those eyes, and find no meaning there. Zorayda ! while the bitter shower I shed, 570 I'll think thee pure, and but bewail thee dead, I'll rush to fields so often shared with thee— Perchance some quiver holds a dart for me." Meanwhile the fight is won ; their leaders slain, The routed Moslems hurry from the plain— " Now, Raymond ! Albert ! now your forces join, Press on their rear, pursue, destroy, confine !" The Monarch cries, and leaves the fmish'd fray, With double wreaths to crown one glorious day ; Where his brave archers on the distant plain, 580 Unconscious of the fight, a tenfold force sustain. Three times the foe had charged his heroes there ; Three times had broken on th' unshrinking square ; Their steeds recoiling from that hedge of spears, Whose every point a waving pendant bears. Three times the baffled chiefs had ridden round The equal sides, nor point of vantage found : In vain their taunts or steely javelins fell, Scorn smiled at those, and these their shields repel. Again they come, the charge stern Adel leads, Λ And swarthy Mestoc, fam'd for daring deeds : \ Full on the pikes they urge their generous steeds ; y
Drum, cymbal, trumpet, join their martial sound, And dust in volumes veils the squadron round. But still from every pike the pendants stream, Still shines through mist the iron's deadly gleam ; The coursers start, obey nor spur nor rein, But break their ranks and riot o'er the plain. ŕí Be fate upon thy point," fierce Adel cried, And flung his dart,—it pierced Llewellyn's side ; 600 Next, calm in silence, powerful Mestoc threw His heavier spear, that youthful Harold slew. " Now, Charge !" he shouted, " Charge ! the day is ours;"— But Sherwood's archers pour their iron showers With aim so true, that where their comrades died, A mound of slaughter'd Ethiops fills the void. As daring Mestoc aims another svound, His head, his arm fall sever'd to the ground ; 'Twas Cœur dû Lion's blosv— so ssvift he came, His deeds alone the matchless King proclaim. 610 The faithful steed, affrighted, bathed in gore, Through shuddering ranks their headless leader bore. While fear and wonder fill the shrinking host, Grief swell'd in Schaunah's brother bosom most ;
Dark as a cloud when big with autumn rain, And towering o'er the height of vulgar men ; On foot he fought, while from the burthen freed Of hÍ3 huge bulk, reposed his weary steed. A groupe of spears his slaves attentive bear, He chose the weightiest, one that few could rear, 620 And backsvard bending, as he aim'd its course, That ail his body's sveight might aid its force, Hurl'd at the King—it pierced each stubborn fold Of his tough shield, his surcoat wrought svith gold, Pierced his stout hauberk, but his vest beneath, Stiff with embroidery, check'd th' approaching death. He cast the frustrate weapon on the sand, And snatch'd a crossbow from a yeoman's hand ; The well aim'd quarrel flies with hissing sound, And Schaunah's eye receives the torturing wound. 630 Bleeding and blind, and giddy with the pain, He drops his shield, and staggers o'er the plain, When through his casque a second arrow flies, And pierced the brain—he bites the ground and dies. Incensed to see his loved Egyptians bleed, The royal Adel spurs his chesnut steed ! He foams with rage, and bids his Prophet hear His vows of vengeance, lost in empty air.
For soon the powerful quarrel check'd his pride ; His better arm hangs useless by his side j 640 And where the jewell'd rein his fingers grasp, A second fixed it in their nerveless clasp ; A third—though hung with glittering fringes round His charger's neck received th' unerring wound : Mad with the smart he gallops from the plain, Nor can his poss'erless lord his flight restrain. Strange was the conflict—gazing on the King Like some fell tiger, crouching ere he spring, The Christians svait, while one brave chief defies A mighty army, and that army flies— 650 Yet, as when rocks the hunted stag oppose, If bold through fear he turns, and fronts his foes, Then baying dogs and archers girá bim rotend, But stand at distance, lest his antlers wound. So forms the host aloof; and darts «re throsvn, And stones and arrows shower'd on hkû alone : But like that stag when insect ssvarms assail, From helm and shield he shakes the dreadful hail. He couch'd a lance, and while his broomy crest Flamed in the splendours of the purpling west, 660 While from his arms ten thousand glories shine, Singly he rides along their crowded line ;
" Hear, Asia, hear ! 'tis England claims the fight, 'Tis England's lance defies your proudest knight ! Sons of the East ! who boast yon glorious flame \ Inspires your valour, shall his parting beam > Bear to our Western Isles the tale of shame ? y Breathes there not one for Islam's sake to meet His Prophet's foe, and veil his Faith's defeat." Ye generous Sons of Ayoub, had you heard, 670 What grief were yours ! for not a warrior stirr'd—* Awhile the Monarch paus'd—then backward drew ; " Now pour your darts," th' obedient arrows flew, While from the arbalist, with deadlier weight, The iron bolts shower fast, and scatter fate. If Christian priests pronounced those weapons curst, Well might the Moslem crowd who felt them first, By secret fears already urged to flight, Deem them some engine of infernal might, On Acre's plain and Arsouf's taught to know 680 The wondrous force of England's antient bow ; A deadlier curse was here—they break, they fly— The bolt pursues them, and in flight they die.
" St. George for England—Charge !" exclaim'd the King, And from the ground his eager warriors spring. Their bows are cast to earth, their falchions gleam j But soon in blood was quench'd the azure beam. In vain contending with his adverse fate, The Soldan sounds retreat,—but sounds too late, 'Twas headlong flight j while, pouring from the town, Each Christian joins to hunt the Moslems down ; Once, since the dawn, with signal victory graced, Their pious zeal a second harvest blest. There was the martial prelate, Raymond's sword, Champagne and Nevile, Winton's gallant Lord ; Grenvillc and Mortimer, and Lusignan, Maulëon, Multon, ever in the van, And stout De Mauny, whose descendant's name Calais and Poictiers give to lasting fame.* But ever first the matchless Richard flew ; 700 Now for some chosen foe the quarrel drew ; Now T bade some wretch his flying javelin feel, Or plied untired the unrelenting steel. vol. ıı. 2 л
Night darken'd on the chace, the moon arose, Yet still the Christians press their routed foes. The trembling slave that sought the veil of night, Curs'd the clear beam that guides the arrow's flight. Shame woke revenge, nor slept th' unsated blade While that soft light one turban'd head betray'd. 'Twas midnight ere the pious King could raise 7Ю In Jaffa's fane the rapturous voice of praise ! On trophied biers Llewellyn, Harold lay, The easy price ofthat triumphant day. c The grateful host, while loud their anthems peal'd, Own'd Heav'n not more their falchion than their shield. Who but has known the blended thrill of joy, And pride, and grief, that waits on victory ? When patriot rapture half repels the tear For those, oh ! never, never, held so dear ; And the lorn heart reproves the rising glow, 720 For what to it is fame or conquest now ? Though its freed country be a name once more, Or rescued realms a thousand blessings pour. But what the pure, th' unsated rapture then, If the bright laurel shew no sanguine stain ?
Ami generous Pity, not Affliction gives The sacred dew that consecrates its leaves. Yet ev'n in Jaffa's svalls two hearts o'erflow With more than pity for a conquer'd foe. With many a fruitless tear young Pardo gas'e 730 His wretched parent to the silent grave ; And tapers burn'd, and ceaseless mass was said— If aught our pious cares avail the dead. Beneath his trophied pillar, vainly rear'd By Sharon's fount, a simple pile appear'd, Where filial los r e, still jealous of her fame, Alone inscribes Zorayda's mystic name. Meanwhile, her heart with equal anguish wrung, Above her father's couch Amina hung. With herbs of posver she cooľd his burning head, And as her hands each healing bandage laid, Sobb'd to believe his wounds beyond her aid. Oft to bis couch svith noiseless step she crept, And indrawn breath, to mark if yet he slept; Trembling to break a rest so calm and deep. Yet fearful death might svear the mask of sleep. Then svatch'd retired, that every breeze sshich came From tbe calm deep, might cool his fever'd frame, 2 a 2
if evd fate in evil glances lie, Drops less than balm from that mild dovclike eye ? At length Almanzor moved,—he svaked, he smiled ; Delightful moment ' for he knows his child. Rapt from his sight, Maimoune's spells had shed Grief through hi& soul, and he had mourn'd her dead ; But nosv he marks hci renovated charms, And blest, and strain'd her in his feeble arms ; While, us she fondly watch'd his brightening eye, And terror strove with gratitude and joy, She tells her hopes ;—he, stiuggling svith his pain, Smiles, for he feels, but will not speak them vain Yet oft, his frame as keener tortures stung, Deep, deadly curses falter'd from his tongue On all of Christian faith— Amina nigh, Averts her waning cheek and tearful eye. íť Light of my age, what means this changing cheei ? Sure thou wilt curse with hatred as sincere > Though not by insult stamp'd so deep," he cric% " The impious race by which thy father dies ? Thou art their captive too—but see ' again— My daughtei '—has some Afrit warp' d thy brain >"
With trembling voice, clasp'd hands and downea-t eyes, " My mother was a Christian !" she replies. ci Aye, till by nuptial rites my fondness gave To me and Mecca's faith my best loved slave. Oft have I marked thee bend at Issa's name, More losvly than a Hadgee's child became ; Yet did our holier Prophet's rites engage, Thine eye still sought his heaven-dictated page ; But had I thought—far sooner had thy death— Amina, speak ; thou art not of their faith ?" 780 " No !" was her quick reply, but something stirr'd On her flush'd cheek, and half denied the word. True to her sex, she fear'd her father's frosvn, More than to rush svhere naked falchions shone. Her captive mother, hopeless to be freed, For rank and power embraced the Prophet's creed ; Then learn'd her brother, at his fortune's cost, Had else redeem'd the gem he valued most. With fruitless tears her hidden Cross she prest, To Mary still her secret vows addrest ; 790 And when Almanzor's love her grief beguil'd, And opening beauties charm'd her in her child, 2 лЗ
She whisper'd truth in many a cautious speech, And bade her love the faith she dared not teach. Now by Matilda led, that daughter's sight Hail'd the mild dawningsof Redemption's light; But had the heavenly beam unclouded shone, Had the pure wave baptized her for its own, Undaunted she through roaring flames had trod, Nor e'er with faltering lips denied her God. 800 She shook before the glance that probed her soul, The voice more dreadful than the thunder's roll. " No more ! 'tis guilt alone that dreads to speak, Thy heart is falser than thy changing cheek ; Nay, 'tis my pure and pious blood disdains To aid deceit, and swell th' Apostate's veins ; But may this curse,"—with fix'd, dilated eye, Kneeling she sunk in breathless agony;— His voice relax'd :—" thou wert a duteous child, \ I spare thee, but,"—again his look grew wild, 810 \ On those whose arts thy childish ear beguil'd y I call the Prophet's vengeance—may the beam, The ocean breeze, the date, the mountain stream To them be death ; their portion want and shame, Their head in whirlwinds wrapt, their heart in flame ;
May grief and pain their manly strength consume, And the curs'd Goules defraud them of their tomb."— Rageburstthehalf-closed wound ; hertremblinghand Would stanch its flow and join the broken band ;— ■ He flung her from him, and the dressings tore, 820 " I did not curse, but thou art mine no more ;— Thy touch is poison, and if thou could'st give A thousand lives, I would not svish to live." Across his face his mangled s r est he thresv, As if to hide her from his loathing viesv ; While in that state when thought is crush'd by grief, And tears now on, yet do not yield relief j Even where she fell she lay— and hours had past, Ere terror rous'd her into life at last, And thought return'd, but svith a deadly chill ; 830 She sought Almanzor's couch :—there all ss^as still ; Wan as the dead, she rais'd the silken fold,— His dreadful glance svas fix'd, his lips svere cold. Now change the strain—let holy joy inspire, And angel warblings join the rapturous lyre ; The silver moon has linger'd on her svane, And fill'd her orb of vestal fire again ; 2 a 4
Nor earth nor ocean, wood nor mountain height, Has roused its echoes at the din of fight. In tower and tosvn the rival hosts repose, 840 In triumph these, in conscious weakness those. Maimoune's heaven-commission'd spells incline To meeker thoughts the generous Saladine ; The Great Eternal bids contention cease, And hatred sleeps, and every heart is peace, Now Sion's courts and Sion's fanes are free, At every altar bends the duteous knee ; And the loud cymbal calls the pilgrim host To joust or banquet at the Soldan's cost. On Sion's hill, beneath the awful dome 850 That rose majestic o'er Messiah's tomb, Europe and Asia met,—but foes no more, For Christian knees have prest the hallosv'd floor. The mystic bread adorns the glittering shrine, The emerald chalice holds the sacred wine. Beneath the altar's tap'stried steps appear'd Tsvo humbler piles, in equal splendour rear'd ;— On one, the pride of Syria's vaunted loom, The crescent gems a velvet field of gloom, With ivory clasp'd the sable Koran laid, 860 And Moslem rites by Moslem priests were paid ;
On yellosv down the beauteous dwarfs incline, And chaunt that fabling page they deem divine. In spotless white the firstlings of the fold Had drest the rival altar, starr'd with gold. Clad in the hue of heaven, as best beseem'd That sacred Book which tells of man redeem'd, The Holy Volume spread ; and round it stand Prelates, the pride of every Christian land : These Hubert leads to pay their holy vow, 870 Long England's glory, and her Primate nosv. While They, the valiant Champions of the Tomb, So long expelí ', their solemn charge resume : Their hoary master, Ermengard, appears, With pious transport fill'd, yet bath'd in tears, For ah ! how few the dear-bought triumph share Of those who once had vosv'd him fealty there. Before the sable altar Adel stood, With all of Joseph's and of Ayoub's blood, Arbelia's youthful prince, and Mosul's pride, 880 And she, the Arab Pallas, Aimahide. Beyond were svaving plumes and turbans seen, Of royal tincture, crimson, svhite, and green ; Rich vests, that Syria knosvs alone to sveave, And daggers glittering like the star4 of eve,
And high-born chiefs from many a distant shore, Of feature various as the robes they wore. Nor less diverse appears the princely train That Europe sends to crowd the ample fane : From Etna's fires, or Cimbria's louring sky, 890 They mix with Asia's ardent chivalry. But courteous smiles, or holy reverence now The frown attemper'd on each haughty brow, Nor though bright swords and corselets glitter'd there, Was more of tvar than festal pomp might bear. O'er burnish'd mail or woven hauberk roll'd, Surcoat and scarf in many a blazon'd fold ; The buckler's massy orb was cast aside, And doffd th' oppressive helm and plumy pride. And (well such scene might Moslem eyes alarm) There royal beauty hangs on valour's arm. With holy rapture fill'd, by Raymond's side Moves meek Matilda, now his plighted bride ; Smiling through tears her proselyte succeeds, Sad Pardo's hand the beauteous orphan leads. But who is she, that mid the lovely train, Comes with the young and arrogant Champagne ? Courteous yet noble, smiling and serene,— No ! 'tis not Salem's self-elected Queen,
In feign'd disease she hides her pride aud shame, 910 That beauteous form is Pembroke's noble dame. But there were two who yet distinguish'd stood, And could not blend, though with a sceptred crowd : Whom Heaven itself with innate glory crown'd, Sought by each eye, and linger'd on when found. Great Ayoub's son, in Majesty severe, Unbent though aged, grave but not austere ; Yet even now was regal pomp forgot, And gold and purple robes, he needs them not ; Nor though within a Christian fane he stands, 920 To yield a kingdom to a victor's hands, Around his form less awful grandeur shone, Than when he mounted on its conquer'd throne. Far different Richard —o'er his polish'd brosv His curling locks still shed their sunny glosy ; And in his eye that playful archness strove, Which charm'd of old his subject Courts of Love. His robes were costly,—nor the gazer deem'd That aught less rich had such a form beseem'd, Yet none might pause to look on clasp or gem, 930 He does not gain, but splendour gives to them ;
And many a timid eye which fear'd to know A hateful gorgon in its country's foe, Admiring gazed ; nor scorn nor hate are found In that calm look which meekly sought the ground : For to a Christian heart, 1юлу worthless here Must earthly fame and regal pomp appear ! Here was Ambition's grave, for here was given Th' eternal blow to him that troubled heaven ; And here celestial mercy deign'd to bear 940 That doom of sin which e'en the proud must share ; Here stoop'd to death, that death itself might die, And life immortal call his saints to joy. While thus he mused, the solemn chaunt began, (t Glory to God, good-will and peace to man." Robed, veil'd in svhite, with spotless garlands crosvn'd, An hundred virgins rais'd the choral sound. Some courts or palaces forsook, and some Left for this pilgrimage their convent dome ; And hence return'd, as different duties call, 950 To social circles, or the cloister's svall. But tsvo for heaven designed, though unprofess'd, Drew the deep sigh from many a pitying breast.
Wrapt in her veil, with faltering steps and slow, Her once clear voice now broken, harsh, and low ; That form, still graceful, wakens soft regret, The mournful mien betrays Evanthe yet. Quick was her sister's step, and trembling, pale, With hurried hand she lifts the novice veil ; Ran with a troubled eye the circle o'er, 960 Then sigh'd, and dropp'd it to bc rais'd no more. Hid were her raven locks, her smile svas gone, The full bright eye was Hermesind's alone. Nosv perfumes burn before the conquering King, And fair-hair'd slaves the costly presents bring, Whatever Asia boasts of spice or gem, And Sion's long contested diadem. Again exulting on a hero's head. The conscious gold a ruddier glory shed ; And Lusignan, svho quits contention's roar 970 For calmer scenes and Cyprus' smiling shore, In unrepining svonder sees the crosvn Sit light on other brows, that scorch'd his osvn. And there svere treasures misers svould not store, Yet then estecm'd abos T e the richest ore ;
AU earth retains of holy men, who first Bade Truth's mild radiance on its darkness burst ; Their touch could then sublimer fervour shed, And sickness shrunk, and howling madness fled ; And though, perchance, a less believing age 980 iteject the relic while it guards the page, Still might they fix the meek and pious eye On death, and hope, and immortality ! And they who lived, and toiľd, and died to save, Speak truth, and faith, and comfort from the grave. Hush'd is each sound, e'en murmuring svhispers cease, The mutual Heralds read the terms of peace ; And nosv on either side advancing there, At either shrine th' assembled Princes swear, These on the Gospel, on the Koran those, 990 To sheathe their swords and be no longer foes. But They, whose will the rival hosts obey'd, Who waked the conflict, and the conflict stayed, Alone adjured not heaven—with one consent, While on the kingly pair each eye was bent,
" Be peace between us !" they exclaim, and stand Full in the midst, and pledge the friendly hand. О Majesty ! thy simple word had then A force beyond the oaths of meaner men. But hark ! that shriek, that groan ! such sounds might rise 1000 From baffled demons in their agonies ! And hark again ! svhat heavenly strains succeed ! More sweet than amorous lute or pastoral reed. What perfumes breathe ! svhat amber glories swim ! What sudden splendour makes the daylight dim ! A lambent flame, whose heaven-de'cending blaze The altar circles svith ætherial rays, Plays round thh Priests, and lights with fire divine, The sevenfold lamps that stand before the shrine. Amazed the Soldan sasv—but, self-deceived, 1010 He doubts the wonder—sasv, yet disbelieved ; Thrice he commands, and thrice his impious cresv Suppress'd the flames, and thrice they blazed anesv ; Trembling he owns the wonder, while the strain Of Christian transport fills the spacious fane :
But he, still erring iu his bigot faith, Reads in that fire the oracle of death. And now a cloud descends ; but lovelier far Than those which follow day's declining car, Or those which in the balmy nights of Juue, 1020 With silver fleeces gird the full-orb'd moon ; It rests upon the shrine, and seems to rise Brighter and brighter, till it touch'd the skies. Now thunder roars around, and lightning plays, Harmonious thunders, and a temper' d blaze ! Now it unfolds—to mortal view is given A glorious vision of the joys of heaven. Veil'd in the wondrous, vast abyss of light, The Triple Godhead shuns created sight ; But seraphs kneel around, and angel choirs 1030 Strike, robed in light, their everlasting lyres ; And they that erst for Sion bled, adore, In bliss eternal, Him whose Cross they bore. Beneath, the Arch of Peace and Promise spread, The type of safety, born in doubt and dread ; And lo ! within its ample circle beam'd The sacred sign that marks its pledge redeem'd.
Lost to man's touch, though to his reverence given, Bright cherubs bear the Holy Cross to Heaven ! Now golden radiance gilds the sacred wood, 1040 While every precious stain that once %vas blood Glows like that gem which needs no borrow'd light, But scorns the earth, and shines amid the night. Far brighter than that starry Cross, on high, Sublimely circling through the southern sky ; Which oft with joy on trackless floods descried, The Pilot's that, as this the Christian's guide, Shews him his path through trackless floods to find, And calms with faith and hope the doubting mind. But at its foot, dejected, луеерк^ there, 1050 What that thin form, so faded, yet so fair ? Which dares not look tow'rds that resplendent throne, Or ask that mercy, meant for man alone ? Ah ! sweet Maimoune ! angel tears were moved For their lost sister, erring, yet beloved ; Well then might they, from Hassan's deadly snares Saved by her suffering, aid her with their prayers ; Nor were they vain—from out the central flame A voice divine,—a voice of mercy came ; A voice unheard on earth since angels trod 10OÙ This nether ball, and mail communed with God. VOL·, h. 2 b

One half of Cyprus had been previously sold to the Tem¬ plars, and in making this exchange of regal honours with Lusignan, Richard was perhaps' more governed by sound policy than would at first appear. He bartered for an empty title only a conquest which it might have been troublesome to maintain ; and bad he ever gained possession of Jerusalem, he would no longer have been bound in honour to uphold tlie claims of a monarch, whose restoration to a throne svhich he ivas unequal to fill, must probably have been followed by a second loss of his kingdom. " Note (h), page 29, line 589. O'er the wide havoc which their winds had spread. The destruction of Ascalon svas extremely painful to Saladine ; and he passed a sleepless night in great agitation before be could give the necessary orders. When be came in sight of the city he shuddered, and after a melancholy silence exclaimed, " my children are very dear to me, but I would rather lose them than touch a stone of this city ; yet if the welfare of religion, and of my people, exact this sacrifice, I svill make it without regret." The Imams and Cadis insisted on the ruin of Ascalon. « The orders of Heaven must then be obeyed," said Saladine, and commanded the citizens to quit their houses. The scene grew more and more distressing, but the Soldan relieved their sorrows as far as was in his power. The walls had been batterei! for many days with little success, and it was probable that Richard would not long delay his advance. The Soldan therefore set the exam¬ ple of destruction, and fires were lighted in every quarter. The tower which has been mentioned was soon tbe only building which remained standing in Ascalon.
Note (i), page 32, line 664. ' Tis said thy hatred loves the impious feast. The Mahommedans seem to have had an idea that Richard did not scruple to eat the bodies of his enemies, and the Romance delights in making him a complete cannibal. He recovers from his illness by eating Saracen flesh, which is served up to him as pork, and afterwards feasts the am¬ bassadors of Saladine with the heads of their own friends, expressing great astonishment at their lack of appetite. Such enormities do not appear historically to have ever tainted the character of the third Crusade; and the belief probably arose from a confused remembrance of the dreadful famine at Antioch during the first expedition to the Holy Land; when the Crusaders are said to have even disinterred the bodies of their enemies that they might feed upon them. Previously tothe surrender of Antioch, Bohemond, who sought to deliver the camp from the spies by which it was infested, caused twelve Saracen captives to be slain and roasted before a large fire, proclaiming that he had discovered this resource against want, and would treat in like manner all his enemies that should fall into his hands. After Richard's arrival in Palestine, there was never any want of provisions to prompt such unnatural acts. Note (k), page 33, line 698. Shrined in its breast Messiah's temple rear.

As the superstition of Europe ascribes to the industry of the devil every extravagance of nature, or stupendous relic of forgotten antiquity, the traditions of the East suppose the mighty works of elder days, the ruins of Ctesipbon and Per¬ sepolis, &c. &c. to have been raised by genii, the offspring of fire, who laboured at the command of the Preadamite Sultans. Note (a), page 44, line 22. Abdollatiph, tke pride of Asia, came. The humanity of Saladine was aided by policy in the courtesy which he displayed towards a departing enemy. To the perishing luxuries of fruits and ices, and the ordinary gifts of Arabian horses and splendid robes, the Soldan added a supply of the precious Balm of Gilead, the panacea of the East, and sent with the presents a celebrated physician, to inquire into the malady of the French King. " Abdollatiph was born at Bagdad, and travelled, like the ancient philosophers of Greece, over many parts of Asia. He was about twenty-eight when he began bis travels, and went first to ' Mosul and then to Damascus, but did not stay long at either. The first was engaged in the chemistry of the day, in which he was already skilled ; at the second he vanquished some opponents in philology. <( He now bent his steps towards Egypt, and to this journey the consent and patronage of Saladine were necessary ; but when tbe Arabian physician arrived at the camp near Acre to solicit it, he found tlie Saracens bewailing a recent defeat; a defeat so honourable to the skill and valour of our English Richard, that nothing less than the late matchless defence of
this fortress, by a handful of British seamen and mariners, could have eclipsed its glory ; hence the lofty spirit of the Soldan was plunged into a morbid melancholy, which exclud¬ ed the traveller from his presence; but the favours he received, evinced tbe munificence of Saladme, and he persisted in his design of exploring Egypt. One strong inducement, which influenced him on this occasion was the instruction which he hoped to derive from the society of the celebrated Maimo¬ nides, the disciple of Avórrhöes ; and by Alcadi al Fadei, who had in vain intreated his return to Damascus, he was furnished with such recommendations as insured him the most flattering reception. " From this intercourse with the great and learned he with¬ drew, however, to present himself before the Sultan ; who having concluded a trace with the Franks, then resided in the Holy City. « He was received with marked respect by Saladine, who granted to Abdollatiph a pension of thirty dinars per month, аь a testimony of his personal esteem and Híg lóvé of science. After the death of the Sultan this sum was raised by his sons to one hundred dinars, till their unnatural uncle drove tbem from the throne of Egypt and Syria, and Abdollatiph was forced to return to Damascus. " He afterwards travelled over many parts of Asia, Aleppo, Greece, Syria, Armenia, and Asia Minor, and died at Bagdad, whither he had gone to revisit his native abode previous to a pilgrimage to Mecca."—See White's History of Abdollatiph. Monthly Review for 1802. Note (b), page 44, line 24?. That Avicene or sage Averrhoes taught. Avicene, or Avicenna, a celebrated philosopher of Bok¬ hara, in Kborassan, died in 1036, in the £8th year of his age. Modern critics are inclined to allow him the praise of a good botanist, but his talents do not appear to have equalled his
leputation, and the intemperance of his life disgraced his character as a physician. Averrhoes, the cotemporary of Abdollatiph and of Sala¬ dme, was born at Cordova, the principal city of the Moors in Spain. He studied theology, mathematics, and the Aristo¬ telian plulobophy, at Seville, and the fame of his talents causal the Caliph Jacob Almanzor to appoint him supreme magistrate and priest of Morocco and Mauritania. This ıapİd advance excited the jeaiouby of his rivals, who soon brought about his disgrace b\ the charge of heresy. His pupil Maimonides left Cordova that he might not be compel¬ led to join the outcry agamst hun. Averrhóes afterwards con¬ fessing himself a penitent, was restored to his honours. He died in 1206. Averrhoes appeals to have deserved his fame by his temperance, his learning, and his clemency as a judge. He was a warm admirer of Aristotle, and of the medical treatise of Avicenna. He was. a great commentator on the writings of others, composed many works on medicine, and is the first who records the observation that the same pei son could have the small-pox but once.

She describes the Moorish houses, whether palace or cottage, as being all built on one model, and varying only in size and decoration.

Each suite consists of a large hail or sala, with an alcove on the side facmg tlie door, for the reception of visitors.

The manner in which Hassan contrived to silence those enemies whom he did not chuse to destroy, may be shewn in the btery of the Imam Fakreddm Razi, a celebrated doctor of Persia. Fakreddm had been accused of a secret incli¬ nation to tbe Ismailian doctrine, and to repel the charge, he publicly anathematized its followers, from the pulpit. His conduct having been reported at Alhamout, the head¬ quarters of the Assassins, the Monarch sent one of his fedais or ministers of death, who tendered to the Imam in his master's n .ше the choice of a dagger or a purse of gold. The softer metal prevailed, and Fakreddin was given to under¬ stand that he might rely on the annual subsidy of three hun¬ dred and sixty bysants, if he would engage never again to speak ill of the sect of Ismail ; but that on the slightest relapse the dagger would be inevitable. At his next preaching, the Imam, as may be well supposed, found an opportunity to praise those who had so lately experienced his malediction: and when thechange was noticed by his friends, he pithily observed, that " certain weighty and pointed arguments had induced him to a change of sentiment."

Tbe circumstances are related at length by Walter of He- mingford. He died while Richard was occupied in collect¬ ing twenty thousand marks for the redemption of hii hostages. Pestilence, numerous fires, great drought and sterility, and a subsequent inundation of the Danube had desolated Aus¬ tria, but without awakening the conscience of the Duke, who thirsted sfili for the English gold, and prepared to cele¬ brate Christmas v itb great splendour, in contempt of the anathema of the Pope, under which his dukedom then suf¬ fered. The first day passed off well, but on the morrow, the martyrdom of St. Stephen, while engaged in martial games with bis knights, his horse fell, his ancle was dislocated, and his leg broken. The next day the physicians found it black and thought amputation necessary ; and as no one durst per¬ form the operation the Duke cut it off himself with an axe and three blows of a hammer. The mortification how¬ ever was not arrested j unequivocal feigns of death appeared, and the Duke -in despair besought the Bishops publicly to release hím fiŕom the excommunication. This they refused till he consented to make the Church judge of his quarrel with the King of England, and that his Optimates should swear to uphold their decree. They then commanded that the hoétages should be liberated svithout ransom, and when the eon of· Leopold, who inherited his father's avarice as w( 4 as bis power, endeavoured to evade the sentence, they so worked upon his fears and credulity, that he not only sent back the hostages, but restored a sum of four thousand marks already received from England.

The attachment of Bertrand to the " young king " had all the impetuosity of his character, and at his death he express¬ ed hie grief in two poems which are still preserved to us.— This event was also the occasion of his reconciliation with Henry the Second.—That king, attributing to Bertrand the seditious conduct of his son Henry, determined to punish him; he besieged the castle of Hautefort, and made Bertrand and all the garrison prisoners. When Bertrand was conducted to bis conqueror, Henry reproached him with many bitter taunts. " It is you, then," said Henry, " who boasted you had more understanding than you could make use of." " I had a right to say so formerly," replied Bertrand ; " but in losing tbe yomig king, your son, I bave lost all tbe reason and tbe ability ï once possessed." At the name of his son, Henry wept. " Ah, Bertrand !" he cried, " unfortunate Bertrand ! your mind might well be perplex-
ed on lobing my коп, for he loved you most tenderly ; und I, for the parental love I bore him, restore to you your liberty, your castle, your possessions ! 1 restore to you my favour and friendship ; and I will give you five hundred marks, to repair the mischief I have done you."

The Saxon Duke was graced taith Helen' s hand.' Richard had encouraged the devotion of Bertrand to his sifter Helen, or Eleanor, who was not insensible to im homage. Her beauty was the theme of many of his poems, and or one occasion, when the camp was in want of provisions, he calmed the pangs of hunger by singing her perfections. Her marriage with Henry the Lion, Duke of Saxony, was the signal for Bertrand's final quarrel with Richard. —If it be ob¬ jected that it was Matilda, and not Helen, who was the wife of the Duke, and mother of the Emperor Otho, 1 can only reply that there is great confusion among historians respecting the sisters of Richard.

On the other hand, he flatters the martial fame of Richard, by comparing him to some celebrated robbers—in his eyes their profession was no dishonour.

Henry of Champagne, then King of Jerusalem, while on a tour to the Lesser Armenia, paid a visit to their King, and was received with distinguished honour. The chief having shewed him his castle, led him at last to a very lofty tower, on each turret of which stood a man clothed in white. " Without doubt," said he, " you cannot boast of subjects so devoted as mine." At the Same time he made a signal to two of these men to cast themselves from the tower—They did so, and instantly expired. " If you desire it," continued the Mountain Prince, " all whom you now behold shall cast themselves down likewise." In taking leave of his guest he
offered to rid him of any enemy whom he might suspect of designs on his crown. In like manner did Hassan display the obedience of his .slaves to the ambassador of Malek Schah. —One man plunged a poniard in his side, and a second flung liirnself from the tower__" Tell your master," said he, " that I have 60,000 soldiers who are animated by tbe same spirit." Nor is this spirit extinct. One of the modern Wahabees, who a few year*, since, stabbed an Arabian chief near Bassorah, not only refused life, but courted death, grasping in his hand a paper which hc seemed to prize beyond existence. This was an order from the Wahabee chief, for an emerald palace, and a number of beautiful female slaves in the region of eter¬ nal bliss. Hassan certainly excelled in the art of systemati¬ zing murder. Note (1), page 1Ш, hne ¥ib. For with the hidden stars his hopes are lost.

And daily musses sought her souTs repose. I know not how the romance of the bloody Queen Eleanor with her bowl and dagger, and the tragical end of fair Rosa¬ mond, has crept into English History. The revenge of the injured Queen was confined to the sending her rival to the Abbey of Woodstock, where her splendid tomb afterwards attracted the notice of Hugh, Bishop of Lincoln, The pre¬ late with a harshness that seems inconsistent with a character otherwise so exemplary, commanded her bones to, be removed from the church. The fable appears to me to have originated in the story of another Rosamond, which is related by Gibbon, in the eighth volume of his history. Note (p), page 149, line 549.

There would be little interest in a more enlarged detail of the events which took place in England during tha absence of Richa«p, but I have alluded to many circumstances which are not mentioned by Hume, and which 1 bave taken chiefly from Mr. Berington's history, or his principal authority Hoveden. Longchamp Bishop of Ely, and the Pope's legate in England, was chancellor of ¿he kingdom, and partook its regency with Hugh Bishop of Durham, the same to
whom Richard had sold the Earldom of Northumberland, with the remark, that he had performed a miracle in making a young earl out o f an old bishop ¡ the oppression and assump¬ tion of the favourite soon disgusted both the nobles and the people, but his power was such that the Archbishop of Rouen, the Earl of Strigulph, Sir Hugh Bardolph and others, whom the King had appointed his counsellors, durst not produce the mandate. He even ventured to arrest his colleague, whom he compelled to renounce his earldom, and threw Geoffrey Plantagenet (the King's brother) into prison. Note (r), page ,151, line 584·. For three Jull years to shun the English shore. Geoffrey Plantagenet, svas the son of Henry the Second and Fair Rosamond. He was first Bishop of Ely, and Pope Celestine the Third long refused to consecrate him in the Archbishopric of York on account of his dissolute habits. The relation which Hoveden gives of the quarrels and in¬ trigues which attended his election is curious. Richard had bound his brother John, at his departure from England, not to enter the kingdom for three years, and he exacted the same oath from Geoffrey. Note (s), page 151, line 590. Too rashly sanctioned what her lords approved. Tlie royal brothers assembled the Barons ; the Bishop of Ely was deposed, and after a faint struggle fled from England in a female habit. The Queen sanctioned these proceedings, and had they stopped there, Richard would have had little cause to complain of his brother's violated vows.—But John soon began to she\, his rebellious spirit, and Geoffrey and Eleanor had soon the opportunity of proving their fidelity towards their lawful monarch.
Note (t), page 152, line 606. To guard his rights, till Richard should return. This refusal is highly creditable to the Gallic nobles, and proves that the chivalrous spirit of honour was already awakened. Philip was unable to triumph over their re¬ luctance till he circulated the report that Richard, not con¬ tent with the murder of Conrad, had suborned assassins against his osvn life. For some time the French king never moved svithout a guard, whose avowed object was to secure him against this attempt. Note (u), page 152, line 608. For Richard's triumphs breath'd on every gale. I knosv not whether I am too partial to my hero, but in all the books, which I have had occasion to consult, Philip Augustus, notwithstanding his superior policy and the praise of the French, cuts so poor a figure, that I cannot help think¬ ing that Richard, with all his faults, has never had justice done towards him. Philip notoriously took every opportunity to defame his rival, and the calumnies which have been already mentioned are not the only ones which he propagated. Speak¬ ing of his return to Europe, Hoveden says, " Qui cum venisset Romam, mala multa locutus est de rege Angliæ, in conspectu domini Papæ et omnium Cardinalium; dicens quod Rex Angliæ coegit eum à terra Hierosolymitana recedere, et appellavit eum de proditione sua. Sed nec Dominus Papa, nec Cardi¬ nales fidem habuerunt verbis ejus, scientes hoc magis ex invidia processisse, quam ex delicto Regis Angliæ." Never¬ theless the Pope received Philip with honour, and absolved him from his vosv of visiting Jerusalem, at tbe same time per¬ mitting him and bis people to bear tbe cross and palm-branch, which distinguished pilgrims, « Deinde Rex Franciæ effecit adversum Romanorum Imperatorem quod ipse regera Angliæ caperat, si per terrani suam transiret. Deinde rex Francia;
veniens in terrain suam, defamavit regem Angliæ adversus próximos suos, imponens ei crimina multa." Note (x), page 152, line 622. Lest one lorn wretch should hear and curse his reign. Richard ordered all tlie prisons to be thrown open at his coronation, lest any of those who languished in confinement should curse his accession. The number of prisoners at the death of Henry the Second seems to have been very great, and, from the temper of the age, it may be doubted whether the most criminal part of the community was always that most likely to be in confinement. This proceeding of the King's was at least an act of general amnesty for past offences. Note (y), page 153, line 641. In Erin s wars, and f or his matefdess bow.

Those who have perused Mr. Ellis's agreeable abstract of our old English Romances of Chivalry, can scarcely fail to remember with pleasure the twelve lays of Marie of France, said to have been composed at the court of our Henry the Second, and which appear to contain more novelty and ele¬ gance of invention than is usual in the Fabliaux of that age. Alphonzo the Second, King of Arragon, was himself a Troubadour and the patron of Troubadours, in whose eyes his bounty covered his numerous vices and his notorious want of public faith. The songs of Bertrand de Born, prove, however, that there were others of the tuneful brotherhood, whose hatred painted in the darkest colours the Prince whom their flattery adorned with every virtue. Beatrix, the sister of Aiphonso, was married to Raymond Bérenger, Count of Provence. They were both votaries of the Muses. Note (d), page 176, tine 99. Arnaud, whose strains the female heart allure. Arnaud Daniel has been celebrated both by Petrarch and Dante. The former calls him the " Great Master of Love," and in a poem, where he begins each stanza with a line from some celebrated poet, he has borrowed one from him, vol. ir. 2 D
the only Provençal on whom he confers that honour. Never¬ theless, the taste of modern critics has agreed to prefer what remains to us of Arnaud de Marveil, whom Petrarch calls " the less famous Arnaud." Arnaud de Marveil was long attached to Adelaide, daughter of Raymond of Toulouse, married to the Viscount de Beziers ; but Aiphonso of Arragon was also an admirer of this lady; and the unhappy Troubadour was at last dismissed, to appease the jealousy of his royal rival. Note (e), page 176, line 108. When Princes sought; and Queens adjudged the prize. Eleanor of Guyenne presided for some time over the Courts of Love, which her son Richard, then only Count of Poitou, held at Avignon. At these meetings questions in the science of Love were frequently debated; some favourite Knight took the name of " the Nightingale, the counsellor of Love," and sustained his side of the argument against other Cavaliers under the names of the Goldfinch, the Chaffinch, &c. it was always understood that tlie nightingale was to be victorious. One specimen of these questions or tensons ďaniour will probably be sufficient : One lady being beloved by a very valiant knight, com¬ manded him to abstain from a tournament, and the prize was in consequence obtained by his rival. Another lady, whose cavalier was a coward, urged him to enter the lists ;—he did so, and was victorious. Which of these knights gave the strongest proof of love? Note(f), page 177, line 1Э8. And knightly youth to deathless deeds inspire. The reader is requested to bear in mind the distinction between the Langue d'Oc, or Provençal dialect, now pre- gerved only in the songs of the Troubadours and the Patois of some regions of France, and the Langue d'Oil, or Romanse
language, the parent of tlie modern French, in which the Trouvères composed their Fabliaux, and the early romances of chivalry. Note (g), pnge 177, line 189. Such Pierre has framed. Pierre Cardinal, who lived nearly a century, and died about the year 1200, is called by Sismondi the Juvenal of Provencal poetry. His numbers seem to have been as har¬ monious as his satire was severe, and he spared neither the highest clergy, the military orders, the monks, nobles, nor even the ladies. Of the clergy he says (w ith a boldness which in those days is almost inconceivable) : " Indulgences, pardons, God and the Devil ; they make use of all. To some they grant Paradise by their pardons, and others they send to hell by their excommunication. There is no crime which the monks will not absolve, and they sell to renegades and usurers the sepulture which they refuse to the poor. To live in idleness, to buy good fish, the whitest bread, the most exquisite wine : this is their whole employment. Would to Heaven I belonged to their order, if this be the way of salvation!" In another place he says :—" Du levant au couchant, je fais cette proposition à tout le monde : je promets un besant d'or u tout homme loyal, pourvu que chaque homme déloyal mc donne un clou. D'un petit gâteau je nourrirais tout ce qu'il y a d'honnêtes gens ; mais, si je voulais donner à manger aux méchans, j'irais sans regarder, criant partout : Messieurs, venez manger chez moi." The contrast between this Trou¬ badour and his contemporaries, who devoted the charms of " la gaie science" exclusively to arms and love, induces me to make one more quotation from Pierre Cardinal :—" Once on a time a storm of rain fell on a city, which struck with madness every person whom it wetted ; and all but one indi¬ vidual, who was asleep and did not leave his house, shared 2 d 2
this fate. When he waked, the rain had ceased, and he went forth to pay visits to his fellow citizens, whom he found indulging in every species of extravagance ; one was dressed, another naked ; one spit up into the air, another was flinging stones ; one was tearing his clothes, another svas dressed in royal robes, and believed himself to be a king. The one ra¬ tional being was astonished to find that all had lost their senses, and sought on every side for a sensible person, but sought in vain. The more he was amazed, the more they too were surprised at his orderly deportment, and they did not hesitate to aifirm that he had lost his reason, because they perceived that his actions bore no resemblance to their own. Then arose an emulation between them, each striving to inflict on him the greatest number of blows ; they push, tear, shake, and overwhelm him ; now they knock him down, now they raise him up ; and with difficulty he saves himself by gaining his own lodging, covered with mud and half dead.— This fable is a representation of the world, and of those who compose it. The world is the city filled with frantic people ; covetousness is the rain with which it is inundated ; and pride and depravity have enveloped all men. If any one has been preserved from them by the assistance of God, he is consi¬ dered as a fool, tormented, and persecuted, because he thinks not like others," Note(h), page 184, line 291. On three huge crags, with horrid depths between. It would be little amusing to the reader to enter into the va¬ rious etymologies of the nameof Trivallis, or even the different opinions respecting its locality. Mr. Sharon Turnerand Mr. Mills read it Tyrolis, and consign the lion-hearted King to a castle in the Tyrol. The description in the poem ispartly taken from some notes on tbe subject with whichl have been furnish¬ ed by the kindness of M. Schweighæuser, Jun., Professor of Greek philosophy at Strasbourg ; though the vicinity to Lan-
dau agrees but ill with the relation that Richard was con¬ fined in that castle while in the power ef the Duke of Austria, and before his fate was generally known. But there are other places which assert the name of Trivallis, and I am inclined to think, that as Richard was not only immured by Leopold, but afterwards compelled to follow the motions of the Imperial Diet to Haguenau, Worms, Spires, and Mayence, every castle which can pretend to the honour of having sheltered the heroic monarch is anxious to claim a title so illustrious. I subjoin a portion of M. Schweig- hæuser's letter : " Le mention de nos monumens me conduit au château de Trivallis, que nous appelions Trifels (fels signifie roche, et Tri paraît designer le nombre de trois, quoiqu'on ait trouvé aussi d'autres etymologies). Mais jc l'ai aussi vu moi-même, et je viens encore de recueillir quelques renseignemens à ce sujet auprès d'un habitant des environs. Vous trouverez quelques indications intéressantes sur les circonstances his¬ toriques qui se rattachent à ce château, dans le t. ii. p. 188, de YAlsatia Illustrata de Schœpflin, qui se trouve sans doute dans quelque Bibliothèque de Londres. Outre votre Richard, Henri VI. y avait fait garder d'autres prisonniers illustres, et des trésors immenses, et déjà Henri cinq en avait fait un usage pareil. Quant à la position, ce château, flanqué de deux autres plus petits et séparés du chateau principal par des vallées, est situé à environ trois lieues à l'ouest de la ville de Landau, sur une montagne sauvage, couvert de forêts ténébreuses, mais dominant la riante vallée, où se trouve la petite ville d'Anweiler. Le hazard d'une promenade soli¬ taire, et qui n'avoit d'autre but que de gravir, avec l'impé¬ tuosité de la jeunesse, les hauteurs et les rochers, m'y conduisit il y a plus de vingt-cinq ans, et je fus singulièrement frappé par les beautés sauvages de ce site, par le* murs impo¬ sants du château queje découvris tout-à-coup et dont une tour 2 d 3
formidable existe encore, ainsi que par les cris des oiseaux de proie que mon approche troubloit dans leur repos." Note (i), page 186, line 337. And steal his accents as I steal his song.

Leopold sold his royal prisoner to the Emperor Henry VI. for 60,000 pounds of silver, of the standard weight of Cologne.

Note (1), page 195, line 533. Or roam as wolves, to feast on human blood. The belief that those who deal in magic are compelled annually to wear for a certain period the form of ravenous animals, and that they are then the most ferocious beasts of the forest, seems to have been a favourite superstition in many parts of the world. America has its wizard tigers ; the forests of Germany their weir-wolves, and those of Annonça their loups-garoux, or bisclaverets. In the Lays of Marie of France (mentioned in a preceding note on this book), there is a pleasing fable under the name of Risdaverct, and the German tale of The Three Sisters, with perhaps many others, have their origin in the same superstition.

Among these was a chair of state of massy gold, belonging to tbe Queen ; and a table formed of one piece of native gold, large enough for twelve persons to dine at. These claims were commuted for a certain quantity of ships and money.

Tlie heroes of the Crusades were almost as much given to weeping as those of Homer and Virgil : but the eloquence and argu¬ ments of the English Monarch seem to have produced no com¬ mon sensation on the Magnates of Germany.

In the suspensions of hostility which occurred during the third Crusade, it was often realized.

Henry in consequence deferred the liberation of his prisoner, and shesved him tbe letters. " Richard then des¬ paired of his liberty." Note (c), page 269, line 47.

Received the King, nor England known his doom. Perhaps of ail the disgraceful circumstances which attended the captivity of Richard, this last is the most scandalous.

Note (f), page 273, line 127. Now Trenchemer joys to steer his long-lost lord. Alain de Trenchemer, the favourite pilot of Richard, is celebrated both in history and romance.

Not ttvice thy ransom ioould have brought thee here. " Tlie citizens having changed their tears into the oil of gladnees, the face of the whole city was adorned, so that the German nobles that accompanied Richard, and vho believed that England had been drained for the ransom of the King, were astonished at the greatness of its wealth, and one of them said to Richard, ' í admire, oh King ! the prudence of thy people. Now that thou art returned, they
shew their riches in safety ; but a short time since, when thou wert in the custody of our Emperor, they deplored their poverty. Verily, О King, if the Emperor could have fore¬ seen the wealth of the English, he would not have believed that England could be easily exhausted; nor have dismissed thee without thou hadst given an intolerable sum for thy re¬ demption.' "— Walter of Hemingford, p. 539. Such speeches are frequently recorded to have been made by foreigners on their visits to England. The latest is perhaps that of the Emperor Alexander. Note (h), page 275, line 169. Till Richard's might isfelt — beneath his power. The besieged heard the clamour of the multitude, and the sound of the trumpets, but thought it a trick of the generals to delude them.

Mr. Ritson, in his collection of songs, &c. relating to the adventures of Robin Hood, seems to think the popular belief of his having been Earl of Huntingdon, not inconsistent svith the manners of the times. Most of the ballads describe him as not being on good terms svith John, which countenances tbe idea that " the King," with whom he had a friendly meet¬ ing, was probably Richard, especially as Hoveden mentions that after the siege of Nottingham, that Monarch visited Clipstone, and Sherwood Forest, and was much pleased with that part of the country, which he bad never seen before. Such an adventure is sufficiently in harmony with Richard's character.
Note (k), page 277, line 217. But a new day rose brighter than the last. Hoveden records it as a saying, on the death of Henry the Second and accession of Richard : " Mira canam, sol occubuit, nox nulla secuta est. Vere nulla nox secuta est post occasum sob's. Nam radius solis solium solis tenens, sole suo jubar lucidius ac latius spargi t." He continues his play of words many lines farther : " Sol pater, et radius filius cius erat." Note (1), page 277, line 226. Used the best means to human wisdom given. The cross-bow was for some time laid aside, in obedience to the second Lateran Council, which proscribed its use, as an instrument of destruction so powerful and so hateful to God, that he who exercised it against Christians and Catho¬ lics should be held accursed. The anathema appears to have occasioned its entire disuse. It had been employed in the first crusade, but does not appear again, even in the Holy Land, till Richard the First, interpreting the prohibition literally, revived it against the Infidels—-whose destruction must be equally pleasing to God and man. He afterwards used it in his European battles ; and when he fell by the " quarrel" at the siege of Chaluz, it was considered by his enemies as an instance of heavenly retribution.

Only two persons of any note are said to have peribhed on the Christian side in the double battle of Jaffa, which may certainly be reckoned among the most extraordinary in history. Those who may be desirous of perusing its details, will find many interesting particulars fn the Histoire de Saladin, and the Histories of the Crusades ; but Gibbon's short account is perhaps more flattering to the fame of Richard Cœur »e Lion, than any thing else which has been written respecting hira ; unless it be Mr. Sharon Turner's admirable sketch of his reign, in his History of England. The terms of the treaty between Richard and Saladine, and the facts on which the concluding pages of the poem are founded, are in the histories of the Crusades. Some liberties have been taken, especially in condensing into one scene the solemn swearing of the peace at Ramla, the accomplishment of the vows of the Crusades, the celebra¬ tion of mass in the church of the Holy Sepulchre, and the behaviour of Saladine on witnessing the descent of the Sacred Fire ; but almost all the circumstances are historical.,

§ Note (a), page 8, line 42.&emsp;*Alkarmel, fellest of Messiah’s foes*.

Mount Carmel is memorable in Sacred History as the spot on which Elijah confounded the priests of Baal, and also as the scene of his retirement. The cavern which the Prophet inhabited is still shewn. This mountain seems to have been indeed one of those “high places” selected for religious ceremonies in all ages, and to have witnessed them in all their variety. After the fire of Heaven had thus once destroyed idolatry, we have the authority of Suetonius, that a pagan divinity of the same name with the mountain was worshipped there. He had an altar, and sacrifices, but no temple or statue. Him the Romans transformed into the Carmelian Jove, to whom Vespasian offered a sacrifice, when he came into Syria to subdue the rebel Jews. The Convent of the Virgin next occupied the height; it was in its turn profaned by Mahommedan superstition, but was afterwards restored, and gave rise to the military order of “Our Lady of Mount Carmel,” instituted by Henry the Fourth of France. I believe this convent is still in existence. Carmel has shared the fate of the rest of Syria, where neglect and oppression have made a desert of regions that nature formed a garden. Its summit is craggy, but even there a few wild vines and olive trees attest the fertility for which it was once so famous, and whence it derived its name, Carmel signifying in Hebrew, “the vine of God.” The mountain forms one of the most remarkable headlands on the coast of the Mediterranean.&#160;<a href="#ref01-a" rev="footnote" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>

§ Note (b), page 9, line 77.&emsp;*Joy! for this night the Queen Sybilla dies*.

Sybilla was daughter to Amalric King of Jerusalem, by his first wife Agnes de Courtenay, only child to Joceline de Courtenay, third and last Count of Edessa. She was first married to William Longsword, son of William the Third, Marquis of Montferrat, and elder brother of Conrad of Montferrat. By him she had issue Baldwin the Fifth. Her first husband dying, Sibylla married Guy de Lusignan, whom she is said to have chosen for his personal beauty. At her father’s death, her brother, Baldwin the Fourth, succeeded to the throne of Jerusalem: but he was a leper, and his talents, though considerable, were not equal to supply the inexperience of youth and the defects of nature. He soon fell a victim to his malady, and the unhappy realm of Jerusalem, already involved in dangers from which only the greatest prudence and courage could extricate it, devolved on the infant son of Sybilla and Montferrat. Raymond Count of Tripoli was chosen as his guardian and regent of the kingdom: but he insisted, as he was next male heir to the throne, that the custody of the young king should be shared by Joceline Count of Edessa. The character of Raymond might have been deemed above suspicion, but the event shewed that his fears were prudent, for in less than six months the little Baldwin died, and his mother succeeded him aa Queen, not without suspicion of having contributed to his death.&#160;<a href="#ref01-b" rev="footnote" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>

§ Note (с), page 11, line 109.&emsp;*The Cyprian sceptre base Comnenus sways*.

At the period when the poem commences, Cyprus was in the possession of the usurper Isaac Comnenus, the descendant of that Alexius who filled the throne of Constantinople during the first Crusade, and whose hollow friendship, perhaps, cost more lives to the noble leaders whom he had invited from Europe, than his enmity could have done. It is impossible to read the history of those times, without wondering at the duplicity of the Greeks and the forbearance of the Latins. The feeling that the Greeks were Christians, and that their vow was to combat the enemies of Christianity seems to have had extraordinary force upon bands of warriors strong enough to have crushed the faithless empire, and who when in Europe were not remarkable for their moderation. In the middle ages (notwithstanding the glorious exception of two Emperors of the Comnenian line) the name of Greek appears indeed to have been synonymous with every possible aggravation of meanness, treachery, cowardice, and cruelty. Vinesauf, in a furious tirade against the Greeks, observes, that the vices of their ancestors remained to them, but that their virtues had all passed into Italy. The perfidy of Sinon, the craft of Ulysses, and the atrocity of Atreus, were still theirs by inheritance.&#160;<a href="#ref01-c" rev="footnote" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>

§ Note (d), page 12, line 148.&emsp;*Have we not crush’d Imperial Conrad’s host?*

These lines allude to the disastrous event of the second Crusade. The Emperor Conrad the Third of Germany and Louis the Seventh of France pursued different roads through Asia Minor; and the valour of the Seljouk Turks of Iconium was not move fatal to the followers of Conrad, than the perfidy of the Greek guides, who injured their health by supplying them with unwholesome provisions, and either led them into deserts, where myriads perished from famine, or betrayed them to their enemies. The Emperor, at last, with less than one tenth of his original numbers, succeeded in joining the army of Louis, which had also met with many disasters, but was in greater force, and had been amused by the Greeks with tales of the feigned successes of Conrad. The battle of Laodicea followed, in which the Turks suffered a defeat so signal, that the Greeks acknowledged the moderation of the Crusaders in not having levelled Constantinople with the ground. But many miseries again awaited them on their road to Antioch, and the second Crusade terminated in the fruitless attempt on Damascus. The town was already in the extremity of despair, when the Syriac Christians became jealous that their western allies should enjoy the spoils which their valour was about to win, and by treacherously prevailing on them to change their point of attack, rendered the whole expedition abortive.&#160;<a href="#ref01-d" rev="footnote" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>

§ Note (e), page 12, line 153.&emsp;*We fill’d with leprosy the courts of kings!*

The successes of Saladine had been assisted by an earthquake, which overthrew the fortifications of several cities that would otherwise have opposed him. These lines allude also to the comets and meteoric phenomena so often noticed in the history of the Crusades, to the frequent famine and drought from which the Christians suffered, and to the leprosy of Baldwin the Fourth.&#160;<a href="#ref01-e" rev="footnote" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>

§ Note (f), page 13, line 170.&emsp;*Who trifles with his friendship, sports with fate.*

The conduct of Frederic Barbarossa, in resenting the duplicity of the Greeks was more spirited than that of his precursors had been. In one instance he shewed his resentment by causing the standard of the western Empire to float from
the walls of Constantinople, and Isaac Angelus found it thenceforward prudent to treat with somewhat better faith, a monarch that he found had the will as well as the power to punish him. The Sultans of Iconium followed the double policy of the Greeks, by feigning a friendship for the army whose approach they dreaded, and then profiting by its fancied security. But Frederic, though attacked in the mountains, and at disadvantage, when the two divisions of his army were at a distance from each other, gave the Turks a signal defeat. The Emperor and his son, Frederic Duke of Suabia, both distinguished themselves highly in this engagement.&#160;<a href="#ref01-f" rev="footnote" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>

§ Note (g), page 19, line 293.&emsp;*“To rule the Eagle!” cried the Prince of Tyre.*

The house of Montferrat was descended from the Dukes of Saxony, and was at this period one of the most powerful in Italy. William the Third, surnamed the *Old*, had married a sister of the Emperor Conrad. He had four sons: Boniface, who received the crown of Thessaly as the reward of his achievements at the taking of Constantinople in 1203; William *Longsword*, the second son, has been already named as the first husband of Sybilla. Reynier, the third, died in the Holy Land about three years before the loss of Jerusalem. The fourth son, who after his imperial uncle bore the name of Conrad, was the most distinguished; and the graces of his person were no less remarkable than his valour. After the surrender of the Holy City, he arrived at Tyre in the very moment when the inhabitants were about to deliver up the town to Saladine. His presence inspired fresh courage, he forced the Soldan to raise the siege, and thus preserved the only city which the Christians still retained in Palestine. His assumption of the government and title of Prince of Tyre was a natural sequel to these events, but it is to be regretted that his subsequent violence destroyed the esteem which he had acquired by his talents.&#160;<a href="#ref01-g" rev="footnote" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>

§ Note (h), page 20, line 304.&emsp;*Or when her warlike peers no more obeyed.*

Scarcely had Baldwin the Fifth expired, when his mother became desirous to reign in his stead, and disdained neither stratagem nor false promises to satisfy her ambition and that of Lusignan. While the Count of Tripoli assembled the Barons of the empire at Napolose, the daughter of Amalric, acting by the advice of Heraclius, Patriarch of Jerusalem, and Eudon, Grand Master of the Templars, announced her intention of separating herself from her husband, and choosing a warrior who was able to defend the kingdom: on condition that the Barons would acknowledge as king, him whom she should elect. The Barons, who expected that her choice would fall upon Raymond, readily consented. The gates of Jerusalem were closed, and Sybilla repaired to the church of the Holy Sepulchre, attended by her nobles, and crowned with a garland. Mass was sung before the sacred tomb. Heraclius vowed fidelity to her in the name of the clergy and the people, pronounced aloud her divorce from Lusignan, and commanded her in the name of Heaven to bestow her hand and the sceptre on the man whom she believed to be most worthy. Sybilla next prostrated herself, to implore the guidance of Providence in her choice; then rising, she raised the chaplet from her head, and placed it on with solemnity on the brows of Lusignan, declaring that “man could not separate those whom Heaven had united.” The nobles felt that they were duped: and if a few, imposed upon by the splendour of the scene, applauded the conjugal fidelity and affection of Sybilla, the majority foresaw the evils which so imprudent a choice was likely to bring upon Jerusalem; and the friends of Raymond, in particular, felt indignant at the elevation of one, who while he filled the high office of Regent during part of the reign of Baldwin the Fourth, had proved how unequal he was to the government of a kingdom, already involved in difficulty and danger. — Hoveden, Michaud, Mills, &c.&#160;<a href="#ref01-h" rev="footnote" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>

The Prince of the Assassins, stimulated, as is supposed, by the wish to be freed from a tribute which he paid to the Grand Master of the Templars, sent offers of alliance to Baldwin the Fourth, and a proposal to embrace Christianity with all his followers. To these advantageous terms Baldwin had agreed, but the Grand Master was loth to give up his tribute, and as the Envoy left the King’s tent, two of the Templars (some say Eudon himself) fell upon him, and dispatched him with their daggers.&#160;<a href="#ref01-k" rev="footnote" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>

<a id="note01-l"></a>
§ Note (l), page 23, line 392.&emsp;*The bonds of life, this pains my sires in heaven.*

In this part of my story I have followed the judgment of Messrs. Michaud, and Marin, who endeavour to repair the injustice which appears to have been done to the character of Raymond by the greater number of historians. His discontent at the election of Lusignan to the throne of Jerusalem, led him to form a party in favour of Thoron, but Thoron declined the proffered honour, and Raymond retired to his county of Tripoli. Lusignan, instead of conciliating him, determined to besiege his town of Tiberias, or Tabaria; Raymond prepared to defend it, and in his anger implored the assistance of Saladine. At this time dreadful portents were seen in heaven and earth, and the Knights Templars and Hospitallers were nearly all cut off by a Musulman army, which had advanced into Galilee, on its way, it was said, to the assistance of Raymond. The terror of this defeat appeased the discords of the Christians, and Lusignan and Raymond were reconciled. The forces of the kingdom assembled in the plain of Saphoury, to the number of fifty thousand, when intelligence was received that Saladine had taken and burned the town of Tiberias, and now besieged in its citadel the wife and three sons of Raymond, who intreated his instant succour. The Barons assembled in the tent of Lusignan, when Raymond demanded to be heard: “I am about to offer,” he said, “a counsel that will surprise all; but I give it with more confidence as it is contrary to my interest.” In a word, he declared that he could not prefer the defence of his own family and possessions to the safety of the Christians of the East; the army now assembled at Saphoury was their only hope, and that to lead it into a dry and barren desert would be its destruction. He swore before God and men that he would voluntarily abandon the county of Tripoli, and all his possessions to save the town of Jesus Christ. Their only interest was to destroy Saladine, and to preserve defenders to Jerusalem; and that all the evils which might fall upon him would become a source of good, since he endured them for the cause of his Saviour, and the welfare of his people. The more generous this advice appeared, the less was it believed sincere. The Grand Master of the Templars, blinded by his hatred to Raymond, interrupted him many times with allusions to his treaty with Saladine, and said that *the hair of the wolf might be seen under the sheep’s skin*. When Raymond invoked the name of Christ, Eudon replied that *Mahommed* would sound better from a traitor. Raymond scorned to recriminate, but offered to submit to death if events were not as he had predicted. Marin compares the blindness of the Christians to that of the Trojans concerning the prophecies of Cassandra. They persisted in accusing Raymond of treason. Yet the force of his reasoning prevailed, and it was determined to remain at Saphoury. But during the night the Grand Master of the Templars came to Lusignan, and filled him with the blackest suspicions of the treachery of Raymond. The weak Prince gave orders for the army to advance: for the first time he was obeyed, and it was for the ruin of the Christians. This army was indeed the only hope of Palestine, for even this was equipped from sources not her own. England had already begun to supply the necessities of other nations; it was supported by the treasures which Henry the Second had sent to Jerusalem; and to associate that monarch in the glory of the expedition, the arms of England were emblazoned on the banners of the Christian forces. All was lost at Tiberias: the wood of the True Cross was taken, the army was annihilated, and Lusignan a captive. If the heroic valour of Raymond on this dreadful day, if the fulfilment of his words, be not evidence of his truth, it might be inferred from the wildness and incongruity of his calumniators. Raymond found refuge at Tyre, and on his return to defend Tripoli, was attacked by a mortal illness, caused by grief at the downfall of the Christians, and the shame of having been suspected of treason by those for whom he had sacrificed everything. His ardent character changed to a deep melancholy, which ended in madness. The time of his death is variously stated. I shall say nothing of the idle stories, that he and Saladine had drank human blood as a pledge of friendship, that he fought masked against the Templars, that he had embraced Islamism, that he was smothered in his bed by his people, who wished to force him to surrender, or that he was stabbed by the envoys of Saladine. Mr. Mills, I perceive, is among those who doubt the fidelity of Raymond, but in my opinion the very violence of his character places it above suspicion.&#160;<a href="#ref01-l" rev="footnote" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>

Hubert, Bishhop of Salisbury, and afterwards Primate of England, deserves to be singled out even from a crowd of heroes; he was one of the bravest warriors of the third crusade, and not more distinguished for his martial prowess than his Christian virtues. This prelate and the amiable Hugh, Bishop of Lincoln, form a striking contrast with the haughty Philip, Bishop of Beauvais, and the libertine Geoffrey, Archbishop of York (son of Rosamond), who became the helmet much better than the mitre.&#160;<a href="#ref01-m" rev="footnote" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>

§ Note (n), page 26, line 449.&emsp;*Till contrite hearts appeas’d the offended Lord.*

As the crusades were supposed to be undertaken under the immediate sanction of Heaven, those who embarked in them expected some evident interposition of divine favour in their behalf. They disdained the common precautions of war, and murmured when they felt those evils to which their own imprudence had exposed them. In those cases, the clergy and leaders who shared the enthusiasm of their followers, or who were at least interested to support it, found their best resource in the assertion, that the crimes of the Crusaders (which were in truth sufficiently glaring) had forfeited the favour of the Almighty, and that it was in vain to hope for success, until a general reformation of manners and morals, accompanied with sincere penitence and humiliation, should first have washed away the stain. The appeal was seldom vain, reformation followed, and the enthusiasm which accompanied it frequently prepared the way to the anticipated success; and though the good resolutions which had been formed, quickly vanished in the delirium of victory, the licentiousness which ensued only gave fresh force to the next admonition. Antioch witnessed two or three of these alternations of feeling. While that city was besieged by the Christians, a severe famine led to the most horrible crimes: but the exhortations of the pious Adhemar were at length answered by a return to the strictest rules of moral discipline. Immediately afterwards Godfrey recovered from a violent illness, and a victory was obtained over the forces which were hastening to the assistance of Baghasian. It would have been heresy to doubt that these happy events were marks of the restored favour of Heaven. Again, when the Christians, having conquered Antioch, were in their turn besieged by Kerboga, and reduced to extremity by a famine still more dreadful than the former, the “pious fraud” of the Sacred Lance was the harbinger at once of the restoration of order, and the signal victory which annihilated the army of that prince. Mr. Mills has drawn a very pleasing picture of the good conduct of the Christian army before Nice. “The camp presented the rare and edifying spectacle of a chaste and sober soldiery; and although not free from the common disposition of exalting past ages at the expense of the present, the confession was drawn from the severest censors, that there was far more virtue among the crusading warriors, than among the hosts of Israel in old time. The simplicity and purity of the early church were revived. So affectionate was the union between the brotherhood, that all things were held in common. The generals not only commanded and fought, but watched, and did the most humble duties of the camp: so that the officer and the soldier were scarcely to be distinguished. Artificial discipline was needless, when virtue pervaded every part of manners,”—*History of the Crusades*, vol. I, ch. iv.&#160;<a href="#ref01-n" rev="footnote" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>

§ Note (о), page 29, line 513.&emsp;*My mother gave me, an unwilling bride.*

Mr. Mills has justly observed, that in the middle ages, whenever a divorce was desired, a pretext was easily found. Yet if ever nonage could bc admitted as a plea, it must be allowed that Isabelle was entitled to claim it, as she was but eight years old when her mother bestowed her on the Count of Thoron.&#160;<a href="#ref01-o" rev="footnote" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>


§ Note, page 30, line 543.&emsp;*Four reverend priests the Book of Life sustain.*

This Standard is described by Vinesauf and most of the writers on the third crusade. Mailly observes, from Le Gendre that the custom of placing the banner on the top of a tree, itself raised on a scaffold, and drawn on a car by six oxen with velvet housings, adorned with the arms of the leader, was prevalent in the twelfth century, and that it came from Italy. The Crusaders probably owed the idea to the Pisans and Genoese, who sustained a considerable share in the siege of Acre. Vinesauf evidently speaks of it as a novelty. The fashion appears to have lasted only about one hundred and twenty years, being found cumbrous and inconvenient. It must have been almost impossible for a defeated army to save its standard.

§ Note, page 30, line 544.&emsp;*Near it rode Lusignan, whose vest displayed.*

For the arrangement of this battle see *Marin; Histoire de Saladin*, vol. ii. p. 184.

§ Note, page 32, line 570.&emsp;*Who in Tabaria’s field its guards subdued.*

Tekieddin Omar was the nephew of Saladine, and one of the bravest of his generals. He was the bitter enemy of the Christians, who had but too many reasons to deplore his valour. At the fatal battle of Tiberias he took Lusignan prisoner, and also the True Cross, which Rufinus, the Bishop of Acre, according to custom, carried that day in battle. The Bishop was armed with a cuirass, contrary to the usage of all the other Prelates, who before him had carried that Holy Wood unarmed, yet had never received a wound, whereas he, notwithstanding his armour, was shot quite through the heart with an arrow. Omar, in presenting the cross to Saladino, observed, “it should seem, from the lamentations of the Franks, that this wood is not the least important fruit of our victory.” After Saladine’s entry into Jerusalem, the splendid gold Cross which the Christians had erected on the summit of the mosque built by the Caliph Omar, and which occupied the site of the Temple of Solomon, was cast down and dragged through the streets in the mud, to the Tower of David, amid the lamentations of the Christians.”—*Maimbourg, Marin, &c.*

§ Note, page 34, line 628.&emsp;*Five dauntless Mamlukes, in his palace bred.*

With this slender guard, five of his principal Mamlukes (for the number is specified) Saladine passed many times through the enemy, and endeavoured to rally his flying troops. Speaking of the Mamlukes, Marin observes, “we must not confound those whom we have hitherto called Mamlukes, with those that afterwards reigned in Egypt. This name properly signifies a domestic slave, and was given to those who were particularly attached to the service of the Prince or his Emirs. In the commencement the Mamlukes were the children of the concubines of the Sultan, but afterwards the latter purchased slaves, of which they formed their *halca* or guard; and they often passed from the vilest employments to the command of armies. Saladine was the first who formed them into a body of soldiers, subjected them to severe discipline, and employed them on the most important occanions. It should be remarked that these Mamlukes wore a sort of yellow livery, yellow being a colour which distinguished all his household and which was affected by those who wished to appear attached to it. His successors in Egypt bought many of these slaves, who became at last the principal force of the state. They defended it at first with courage, but concluded by invading it themselves. We must not forget to say, for the history of manners, that these Mamelukes *wore the arms of the Sultan*, but that, to distinguish individuals, bars of crimson, roses, birds, griffins, and other figures were added to them upon the shield.”—*Histoire de Saladin*, tom. i.

Under the Abassides, black became the standard of the Caliphs, and has ever since continued the distinctive colour of Islam, or Mahommedan orthodoxy, in opposition to the green banner of the Fatimite Caliphs, and the white one of the Suffees “the inspired.” It has always been the custom for the principal Arabian or Moorish families to distinguish themselves and their followers by appropriate colours; of which many amusing exemplifications may be found in the History of the Quarrels of the Abencerrages and the Zegries, in the “Civil Wars of Granada.” Yellow was the peculiar badge of the house of Ayoub, the father of Saladine; and the Soldan, no less proud to display his orthodoxy than his personal power, always took care to blend the *black and yellow* in his standards. Omar, as the nephew of Saladine, bore a yellow plume, and a yellow banner. In his wars with the Christians, the Koran was always carried in state in the army of Saladine; a proof that he, no less than the Crusaders, considered himself engaged in a religious contest.&#160;<a href="#ref01-p" rev="footnote" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>

Ranulph de Glanville is named among the Norman Knights, and it is therefore probable that he was a Norman by birth as well as by descent. In his youth he was a distinguished warrior; he led the armies of Henry the Second more than once, and took the King of Scotland prisoner at Northallerton. He was afterwards Justiciary of England, and is reported to have been the author of the law-book which bears his name; the earliest which gives any coherent account of English laws, and perhaps the first treatise on jurisprudence which appeared after the dissolution of tho Roman empire; but Mr. Reeves (Hist. of English Law, vol. i. p. 121) seems to think it unlikely that in those days a great political character should have been also an author. He suggests the possibility that the work might bear his name, from having been composed under his patronage and superintendance. When Henry the Second died, Glanville, to avoid engaging in his old age under a new master, took the cross, and sailed to Palestine, where he seems to have arrived soon after the commencement of the siege of Acre, about two years previous to the battle in which he fell.&#160;<a href="#ref01-u" rev="footnote" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>

§ Note, page 45, line 830.&emsp;*The heaven descended Oriflamme unfolds.*

The Oriflamme, or sacred banner of France, was reported to have descended from heaven, in honour either of Clovis or Charlemagne, It was, according to Mailly, a simare banner of flame-coloured taffeta, without figures or embroidery, but with three deep indentures at the bottom; and suspended to a gilded lance. Hence was derived its compound name, the word *flamme* relating to the colour of the silk, and being also a name commonly given to banners of that form. Other writers have said that it was embossed with the golden lilies of France; but they have possibly confounded it with the royal standard, of which notice will be taken in a subsequent note. Mr. Southey, in his Joan of Arc, states that the Oriflamme was originally used only in wars against the infidels, and that in after years it became a signal that no quarter was to be given; he adds that when Philip (as reported by some historians) erected the Oriflamme at Crecy, Edward in return raised up his burning Dragon as the English signal for massacre.—The Oriflamme was in fact only the standard of the abbey of St. Denis, and borne in its wars by the Counts of Vexin, as *Avoués* or secular champions of the abbey, till Philip the First united the Vexin to the Crown, when this banner being in high reputation, he gave it place before even his own standard; the taste of the age enveloped its history in fable, and it was believed to ensure victory. The fallacy was at length proved, and the Kings of France found it expedient to forget it, or to feign that it had been reclaimed by Heaven under Charles the Seventh. Philip Augustus, previous to his embarkation for the Crusade, received the Oriflamme, and the *bourdon*, or pilgrim’s staff, with great solemnity in the church of St. Denis.

§ Note (x), page 48, line 908.&emsp;*And the glad seas feel lighten’d of their weight.*

In ages when the ocean has become the readiest means of communication between distant regions, it is hardly possible for us to conceive adequately the terrors of such an expedition as the voyage from France or England to Jerusalem in the twelfth century, and it is probable, that nothing short of the almost incredible waste of human life which had been occasioned by the land journeys of the pilgrims, would have prompted the hazardous enterprize. In the time of Magnus the third of Norway, Skopte Augmundson, allied to the Royal Family, had warm discussions with the king about the succession of an estate, and not obtaining his demands, left the court. In 1100 he equipped five vessels for the East, and took with him his three sons: but they all died before they reached Palestine. He was however the first Scandinavian who had passed the straits. The ardour of crusading was kindled. Sigurd, one of the sons of Magnus, embarked from Norway with sixty vessels; was well received on his way by Henry the first of England; took the fort of Cintra in Lusitania from the Saracens, beat them next at Lisbon and Alcazar; twice fought their piratical fleet, passed the straits, and in the Isle Formentera attacked the cave of some infidel pirates. It was overhung by a rock, which the Norwegians mounted, and crushed them with stones; then lighted wood before its mouth, and almost stifled the brigands, who made a desperate sally, but in vain; they were all destroyed. Sigurd gained a great booty, and received the solemn thanks of Yvica and Formentera for their deliverance. He was afterwards kindly received by Roger the Second of Sicily, and in 1110 landed at Ascalon, whence he made the pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and assisted at the siege of Sidon, The voyage had occupied more than two years, and this expediton, which has been strangely neglected by historians, was considered as one of the most remarkable of those which occurred during the Crusades. But it was only the nations of the Baltic and Adriatic who possessed any share of maritime spirit or power. In the days of Charlemagne, France had something like a navy, but it declined under his feeble successors, and was annihilated after the usurpation of Hugues Capet. England was not better provided. The Saxons had lost all the naval pride of their ancestors, and the Normen, or Normans, whose Danish forefathers had been the scourge of Britain, after
their conquest of England, bounded their voyages to the passage of the channel. Genoa, Pisa, Venice, and the Saracens of Barcelona, engrossed the whole commerce of Europe, and Philip Augustus and <span class="smallcaps">Richard</span> were alike compelled to hire from the Genoese the vessels which conveyed them to Palestine. Nor were these vessels the floating castles of modern England. Closely resembling the Liburnian galleys of the Romans, they trusted more to oars than sails. The compass was not then in use, and every nautical art imperfect and ill understood. The relation which Hoveden and others have given of the voyage of <span class="smallcaps">Richard</span>, proves how completely the pilots stuck to the shore, and how much they feared the element which they pretended to govern. Even in the thirteenth century it was rare for a British ship to be seen in the Mediterranean. — *Catteau Calleville, Révolutions de la Norvège. — Mailly, &.*&#160;<a href="#ref01-x" rev="footnote" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>

Fuller commends <span class="smallcaps">Richard</span> for confnming and extending these laws. The rules which he enacted for the maintenance of order on board his fleet, though strongly marked with the character of the times, seem to have been dictated by good policy. <span class="smallcaps">Richard</span> has also had the credit of a set of regulations compiled in France under St. Louis, and chiefly borrowed from the “Consolato del Mare,” or earliest maritime code of the middle ages, which was promulgated at Barcelona in the beginning ot the thirteenth century, and being acceded to by Philip Augustus and the Count of Provence, became binding in the Mediterranean, Mr. Hallam says, that these regulations were called the “Laws of Oleron,” from an idle story that they were enacted by <span class="smallcaps">Richard</span> I, while his fleet lay at anchor in that island on its voyage to the Holy Land. But it is unlikely that another nation should give an English Sovereign the credit of any improvement which it might itself have disputed, and I think it probable that the “Laws of Oleron” originated with Richard, though they may have been first collected and consolidated under St. Louis.

The author must here beg pardon of all who may be interested in the fame of William the Second of Sicily, for having, to suit her story, bestowed upon that monarch a less amiable character than history assigns to him; in short, for having arrayed him rather in his grandfather’s colours than his own; though the appellations of the Bad and the Good are neither of them perfectly consistent with historical truth. At the death of William, Sicily became a scene of confusion. Constantia, daughter of Roger, the father of William, and married by the ambitious policy of Frederic Barbarossa to his second son Henry, afterwards emperor, was the legitimate heiress. But Tancred, the bastard offspnng of William, with the aid of a strong party in the island, which could ill brook the idea of a foreign master, or a female reign, usurped the sovereignty, and threw Matilda the widow of William into prison.<span class="smallcaps">Richard</span>arrived shortly after at Messina, wher Tancred found it prudent to set her at liberty, and to compromise the claims which <span class="smallcaps">Richard</span> made upon him for her dower, and for the wealth which William had bequeathed to Henry the Second of England, by the payment of twenty thousand ounces of gold as a compensation for the dower, twenty thousand ounces for the legacies, and by agreeing to equip ten galleys and six palanders or horse transports, for the use of the Crusaders. — *Hoveden, Mills, &c.*&#160;<a href="#ref03-a" rev="footnote" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>

Having described the ornaments, and mode of procession of the assistants, the monk of St. Alban’s goes on; ‘They then stripped him of all his clothes except his breeches and his shirt, which was unsewed between the shoulders, for the convenience of anointing; being thin-shod with sandals worked with gold, the Archbishop Baldwin anointed him King, upon the head, between the shoulders, and upon the right arm, with prayers appointed for this purpose. Having then laid a blessed linen cloth upon his head, he placed the bonnet thereon. Having then clad him with the royal robes, together with the tunic and dalmatic, the Archbishop gave him the sword to subdue the enemies of the Church, which being done, two Counts put on his spurs, and having then received his mantle, he was conjured by the Archbishop, on the part of God, not to accept of the royalty unless he intended to keep his oath. Then taking the crown from the altar, he delivered it to the Archbishop, who placed it on the King’s head; he at the same time received the sceptre into his right hand, and the royal wand into his left. In this account I shall only notice the following particulars, namely, that the royal robes consisted partly of ecclesiastical ornaments, namely, the tunic and dalmatic, which are the principal dresses of deacons and subdeacons; becondly, that the spurs, which are the emblems of knighthood, were fixed on, not by the Archbishop, but by secular Barons; and lastly, that the King first took his crown into his own hands, and so delivered it to the Archbishop, to signify that he did not hold his temporal power of the Church. This circumstance was of the utmost importance, at a time when the Church had recently forbidden Bishops and Abbots to receive investiture from temporal princes, by the pastoral staff and ring, lest it should be inferred that temporal authority was held of the Crown.’”

Dr. Milner dismisses the subject with the mention of a few of <span class="smallcaps">Richard’s</span> exploits, and speaks of his valour and magnanimity with admiration as warm as they elicited from Mr. Gibbon.&#160;<a href="#ref03-b" rev="footnote" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>

§ Note (c), page 89, line 136.&emsp;*What knights in tilting or Castilles excel.*

A tournament usually lasted several days, and the exhibition of each day was different. As the tilt and the mêlée answered to the single combat and the battle, so did the Castilles to the assault of a castle. The attack was generally made with violence, and was often attended with bloodshed. In 1546 the Court of France passed the winter at La Roche Guiоп, and amused itself with the construction of Castilles, which were bombarded with snow balls. The weapon may appeal harmless enough, yet these Castuiles cost the life of the Duke D’Enghien. See M. de St. Palaye sur l’Ancienne Chevalerie. — Some idea of this martial spoit may perhaps be formed from the attack on the Castle of Beauty, at Camacho’s wedding, described in Don Quixote.&#160;<a href="#ref03-c" rev="footnote" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>

To this circumstance many allusions are made in Don Quixote, particularly when a scarlet mantle is thrown over him, on his arrival at the Duke’s castle. Our forefathers were also much attached to costly furs, with which they bound or lined the mantle, as may be still seen in the state robes of our nobility. The favourite furs were the royal ermine, the miniver, the sable, the *gris*, and the vair, or grey squirrel. The knights sometimes wore surcoats of vair or other furs, whence they have been introduced in many families as the held of their armorial bearings. — *St. Palaye, &c.*&#160;<a href="#ref03-d" rev="footnote" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>

Pigment, hypocras, and clairette seem to have been mixtures of wine with honey and spices. The hypocras was the most esteemed. The Clairette is said to have been sometimes served warm: perhaps, if we allow the substitution of honey for the modern luxury of sugar, which the Crusades had then but partially rendered known, the familiar names of mulled wine and negus may give a tolerable idea of these favourite beverages.

It was the custom at these state feasts to remain many hours at table, and the intervals between the several courses were beguiled by various “interludes,” or theatrical representations, which took place on the very table round which the guests were seated. The personages which figured in these interludes were generally allegorical, and contrived to flatter the principal guests. The machinery was probably very inferior to that now used in pantomime, and the astonishment of the historian has undoubtedly not taken from its effect, yet it often raises an idea of more ingenuity than we are apt to expect from so rude an age, A more particular account of one of these interludes will be given in the note to the Vow of the Peacock. In the History of the Civil Wars of Granada the strange devices which the knights exhibit on their entry to the tournament held by Abenamar, and the wonderful transformations which occur, are so much in the style of these interludes, as to leave little doubt that the latter must have been of oriental origin. — *St. Palaye, &c.*&#160;<a href="#ref03-h" rev="footnote" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>

The courts and castles were excellent schools of courtesy, of politeness, and virtue, not only for the pages and squires, but also for young ladies or damsels. They were early instructed in those accomplishments which accorded with the manners of the age; were taught to receive with politeness the knights who arrived at the castle; to disarm them, to give them fresh clothes, serve them at table, and even attend to their wounds. But perhaps it would be difficult to convey a better idea of these feudal customs than is to be found in many of the speeches of that mirror of chivalry, the valiant knight of La Mancha. It was usual for the inferior knights to send their daughters for education to the castles of their feudal lord; but any lady of distinguished rank, beauty, and merit was solicited even by those whose lands lay at a distance, to accord to their children the advantages which they would derive from her instruction and example. — *St. Palaye, Ellis, &c.*&#160;<a href="#ref03-i" rev="footnote" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>

§ Note (m), page 101, line 398.&emsp;*In loflier numbers breathed Tyrtæan fire.*

Bertrand de Born was one of the most extraordinary characters of his day, and Millot, (Hist. Littéraire des Troubadours), remarks on the manner in which he has been passed over, both by literary and political historians. He was Viscount of Hautefort, in Perigueux, and began his career by depriving his brother of his share of inheritance. The unhappy Constantine obtained the support of the Count of Perigord, and Talleyrand Lord of Montagnac (ancestor to that Talleyrand, who held so distinguished a place in the cabinet of Napoleon), while <span class=”smallcaps”>Richard</span> of England, then only Count of Poitou, and the Viscount of Limoges, suspended their own quarrels to embrace the cause of the injured. On the other side, Bertrand was supported by the Viscounts of Ventadour, Segur, Gordou, Gévaudan, Tartas, and Turenne. The Counts of Foix, Angoulême, and Armagnac; the Lords of Puiguillen, Clarensac, Gragnel and St. Astier, great Barons, of Perigord, and, to crown the whole, the Prince Henry, elder brother of Richard, was to take the command. Many of these names are as uncouth as if they had been borrowed from the Tartars, and have little interest to an English ear, but their number shews the manner in which the fiery Bertrand always contrived to engage in his own quarrels all the princes who were within the reach of his friendship or his reproaches. As violent in love as in war, his impetuous passions exhaled themselves on every occasion in songs, which have more of the strength than the sweetness of poetry. By these he animated his soldiers, he encouraged his allies, he irritated his enemies, he sustained his own hopes; and, when the flame of war was extinguished, by these he had power to rekindle it. It would be useless to follow Bertrand through the story of his life, or rather of his wars, but some farther particulars will be given in another part of the poem. Suffice it to say, that Richard, by negotiation, contrived to avoid an engagement with his brother, and that Bertrand, after many alternations of friendship and hatred, finished by becoming the implacable enemy of the Lion-hearted King.&#160;<a href="#ref03-m" rev="footnote" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>

§ Note (о), page 103, line 444.&emsp;*Placed on a golden dish of rare device.*

Of all the “noble birds,” the peacock and the pheasant enjoyed the highest rank. They appeared only at the most splendid feasts, they were dressed with the richest spices, decorated with gold, and jewels, and borne to the table by the most distinguished ladies. To carve the peacock or the pheasant, was also one of the proud privileges of the bravest cavalier, and he to whom it was offered, was obliged in courtesy to protest his own unworthiness, and not to accept the office but upon “great persuasion.” The vow of the peacock is, perhaps one of the most romantic features of chivalry. The lady bore the honoured bird, which was always adorned with its gayest plumage, to every knight in succession, beginning with him who was first in valour and rank, and each knight was expected to signalize his courage and his love by some vow, made “before the peacock and the ladies.” When this ceremony was completed, the peacock was borne back to the table, and placed before the chosen knight, who drawing his sword, began to carve it with great ceremony, and it was expected that he should so divide it, as to give a morsel to each guest, however great might be the number. To illustrate this subject, and that of the interludes already mentioned, I will abridge a part of the account given by M. de St. Palaye of the feast held at Lille, in 1453, at the court of Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, on account of the crusade against the Turks, who had just reconquered Constantinople: “At last the festal day arrived. If the magnificence of the Prince was admired in the number and abundance of the courses, it shone still more in the spectacles then known by the name of *“Entremets.”* Divers decorations, machines, figures of men and uncommon animals, trees, mountains, rivers, even a sea covered with ships, appeared in the hall. All these objects, intermixed with men, and birds and other living animals, were in motion in the hall or on the table, and represented a sort of allegorical ballet. It is difficult to suppose what must have been the size of this apartment, which contained a table so spacious, besides the multitude of guests and spectators. All at once a giant appeared, armed like a Saracen of Grenada. He conducted an elephant, who bore a castle, in which was a distressed dame clothed in black like a nun. In vain she requested the giant to stop: he led her forward to the table of the Duke, and there the captive lady, who was intended to represent Religion, recited a long complaint of the evils which she suffered from the Saracens, and the tardiness of those who ought to deliver her. Toison D’Or, King at Arms of the Order of the Fleece, then advanced, preceded by a long file of pursuivants, with a living pheasant on his finger, adorned with a collar of gold and gems, and presented to the Duke two damsels, of which one was Violante, bis illegitimate daughter, and the other Isabeau of Neufchatel, daughter to the Lord of Montague; each lady being accompanied by a Knight of the Golden Fleece. Then the King at Arms offered the bird to the Duke, in the name of the ladies, who recommended themselves to the protection of their Sovereign, “to the end that the antient customs might be observed, according to which at feasts and other noble assemblies, a peacock or other noble bird was presented to the princes and lords, that they might make vows in behalf of the dames and damsels who besought their assistance.” The Duke replied, “I vow first, to God my Creator, and to the most glorious Virgin, and after them to the pheasant and the ladies,” to carry the war among the infidels, &c. &c. The signal was followed by all his court: each knight vowed to distinguish his courage against the Turks by some singular exploit; and imposed upon himself some arbitrary penance. Some would not sleep on a bed, others would not eat off a table-cloth, some would abstain from meat or wine on certain days, some would not wear a particular piece of armour, or would wear it day and night; some clothed themselves in sackcloth; in fact, the admirable ridicule of Cervantes was but the echo of these vows, which we that live in soberer days are apt to believe only the inventions of romance writers. The vows finished with a new spectacle. A lady clothed in white, like a novice, and bearing her name of *Grâce Dieu* in golden letters on her shoulder, led in twelve damsels, who represented the Virtues, which were to accompany the Crusaders. Each bore her name also embroidered in gold, and recited a few verses. These twelve ladies were the knightly virtues of Faith, Charity, Justice, Reason, Prudence, Temperance, Fortitude, Truth, Generosity, Diligence, Hope, and Valour, *Et toutes enfin commencèrent à danser en guise de mommeries, et à faire bonne chère pour remplir et rachever plus joyeusement la fête.”* One of the most singular of these fantastic scenes is the Vow of the Heron, which forms the subject of an ancient poem, printed also by St. Palaye. The Count D’Artois being banished from France, took refuge in London. One day his falcon caught a heron. The Count was at first indignant at so vile a capture, but afterwards gave orders to his “officiers de la bouche” to pluck and dress it. At night, when Edward the Third was at supper with his nobles, his Queen and her damsels, he entered, attended by minstrels and two noble ladies, bearing the heron between two silver plates, and advancing with great state to Edward, presented to him this most cowardly of birds (which is said even to fear its own shadow), as the reward of his indifference for a crown which he allowed to remain in the hands of his rival. Stung with this taunt, the enraged King swore that the year should not pass before Philip should see him in France, bearing fire and sword, to avenge this affront, were the French army ten times greater than his own. The Count D’Artois then went round to the nobles, and all hastened to bind themselves by some wild condition. The gallant Sir Walter Manny, whose ancestor accompanied <span class=”smallcaps”>Richard</span> to the third crusade, engaged to take a certain town defended by Godemar du Fay. The Earl of Salisbury declared, in honour of the lady of his heart (the daughter of the Count D’Erby), that he would not uncover his right eye during the war. It is impossible to read the vow made by Queen Philippa without shuddering, for she called heaven to witness that she would destroy herself and her unborn infant, if the period of its birth should arrive before her husband had taken her across the seas, in acquittal of her oath. Edward was filled with horror at her words, and forbade the vows to be continued. The heron was cut up and eaten. Froissart mentions, that at the battle of Poitiers there were many young knights who had one eye covered with cloth, and that they had sworn to their ladies not to restore it to its use till they had signalized their prowess in France. But most of these conceits were the refinements of a later age of chivalry than that in which the poem is placed.&#160;<a href="#ref03-o" rev="footnote" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>

He was afterwards minister to William Longsword, Rollo’s son and successor, and guardian to his child during his minority. He married a lady of the royal family of Burgundy; from his eldest son descended the ancient Earls of Leicester, while the offspring of the second took the name of Harcourt, and were renowned both in England and France. The Sir Robert Harcourt mentioned in the poem was the son of Ivo, and inherited his father’s English possessions, leaving those in Normandy as the portion of his brothers, but it was properly his descendant William, the same that took so distinguished a part in the siege of Damietta in 1218, that acquired the surname of the Englishman. The Harcourts seem to have been particularly stricken with the mania of crusading, and there is scarcely a single expedition to the Holy Land of any importance, in which they were not conspicuous.&#160;<a href="#ref03-ee" rev="footnote" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>

§ Note (hh), page 110, line 579.&emsp;*His name renow’nd on earth, his “Hope in Heaven.”*

The name of Percy comes from a town in Lower Normandy, near to Villedieu, and not, as some have supposed, from the accident of piercing a King of Scotland’s eye, at the siege of Alnwick Castle: for though that accident is said to have befallen Malcolm the Third (who was contemporary with William Rufus), the officer that slew him was named Hammond, and had no connexion with the Percy family, who did not possess lands in Northumberland till the time of Edward the Second. Its progenitor was Mainfred, a Danish chieftain, who made irruptions on France prior to the expedition of Rollo. Two of his descendants, William and Serlo, assisted William of Normandy in his conquest of England. William was much beloved by the Monarch, and obtained large grants of land in Hampshire and Lincolnshire. He was also in habits of close friendship with Hugh Lupus, who bestowed on him the lordship of Whitby, where he restored or rather founded the abbey of St. Hilda. His brother Serlo became the first Prior, and his nephew William, who was at Serlo’s death chosen Abbot, was of such high renown for sanctity, as to be afterwards canonized. This first Lord William de Percy was surnamed Alsgernons (aux Moustaches); he went with Duke Robert and other Normans to Palestine in 1096, and died at Mount Joy, so named by the pilgrims who usually had the first view of the holy city from that eminence. Here his followers interred his body, but brought over his heart, according to the practice of those ages, to be deposited in Whitby Abbey. His wife was Emma de Port, for the Conqueror having bestowed on him Semar, near Scarborough, and other lands, “he wedded her that was very heir to them, in discharging of his conscience.” Emma outlived her husband, and was herself a benefactor to Whitby.

Their son, Alan, called the great Alan, was also so benificent to the Abbey, as to acquire the title of its second founder; but his warlike achievements are wrapped in oblivion. He had seven sons, and the eldest of these had four children, but they died early, and he and his brothers passed away and left no heir. Maud, the eldest daughter, had married William de Plesset, Earl of Warwick: but he also died childless in Palestine, and the only hope of succession remained with the youngest daughter Agnes. She married Josceline de Lovain, son of Geoffrey Barbatus, Duke of Nether Lorrain, Count of Brabant and Lovain, and brother to Adelicia, second wife of Henry the First of England. He took the name of Percy, but was permitted to retain his hereditary device, *Or, a lion rampant, azure*, which with a change of colour only, is still the arms of Brabant and Hainault. Josceline was of one of the noblest families in Europe, being descended from Charlemagne, and from the illustrious Duke Regnier, who was taken prisoner by Rollo the Dane.

Henry de Percy was the true representative of this illustrious line at the time of <span class="smallcaps">Richard’s</span> Crusade; but to avoid confusion, from the endless repetition of the same familiar name, I have changed it to one frequent in the family annals. In 1234 his younger brother Richard had contrived to get possession both of lands and honours, and it was not till after a solemn trial before Henry the Third, that his nephew William (son of Henry de Percy) obtained justice. The motto alluded to in the text is, “Espérance en Dieu.”&#160;<a href="#ref03-hh" rev="footnote" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>

§ Note (ii), page 110, line 593.&emsp;*His look appall’d, and death was in his blow.*

The elder Percevais seem to have been remarkable at once for talent and cruelty. They are sprung from Robert, younger son of Eudes, sovereign Duke of Brittany; but were thence transplanted into Normandy, and at the time of the Conqueror possessed the castle of Yvery, with great estates and power, and the hereditary office of chief butler. Some of the family came to England with William; but Roger de Yvery, faithfully adhering to Robert, his eldest son, against William Rufus, was by the latter dispossessed of many of his lands, and particularly the castle of Yvery in Oxfordshire, which was bestowed on Guy de St. Valery, and was thenceforward called St. Valeria.

In the meantime the main stem of the family reigned at the castle of Yvery in Normandy, which was built by Albreda, wife of Ralph, Earl of Yvery and Baieux, who had more of the lioness than the dove in her composition, for when the castle was finished, she ordered the architect’s head to be struck off, that he might not build another like it; and afterwards, attempting to retain possession of it against her
own husband, was killed by him in the attempt. Their son Ascelin (sometimes called Gouel de Perceval) inherited all his mother’s ferocity, and acquired the surname of Lupus from his violent character. He was a great warrior, and commanded the Norman forces at Mantes, where William the Conqueror received his death-wound. But one of the most remarkable features of Ascelin’s life, was his war with the Earl of Bretevil, on account of a woman which his (Ascelin’s) youngest brother had ravished. He defeated the Earl, took him prisoner, and confined him three months in the castle of Breherval, where he was treated with the utmost severity, and exposed at the upper windows of the fortress to the frost in the depth of winter, covered only by his shirt, which was previously dipped in water, and in this situation was he compelled to remain till it froze to his back. Nor could he escape *ex ore Lupi*, from the jaws of the wolf, till he agreed to give three thousand dreux pounds for his ransom: and, what must have been more galling than all the rest, to yield his only daughter in marriage to Ascelin. Nevertheless the war revived, till in three years the Earl was nearly ruined, but he found means to interest Philip King of France and Robert Duke of Normandy in his cause, and also the clergy, who were incensed against Asceline for the little reverence he had shewn them. In Lent, 1095, the Earl, with the forces which all these allies could raise, assisted by Robert de Belesme, a very expert officer, and an inveterate enemy to Ascelin, and by the engines which had lately been used at the siege of Jerusalem (they having been invented about that time by a famous engineer in the first crusade), attacked Asceline, in Breherval; but he defended it two months against them all, and at last made a treaty, by which he remained in possession of all his honours, only allowing the Earl of Bretevil to retain quietly his castle of Yvery, the suzerainty of which Duke Robert had bestowed on him, and which was one cause of quarrel. Ascelin not liking to pay to the Earl the homage he had formerly paid to the Duke.

The second son of Ascelin, William, surnamed *Lupellus*, or *the little wolf*, rebelled against Henry the First. After an unsuccessful battle, he was taken prisoner by a peasant, but bribed him with his arms to let him escape. The peasant shaved him in the manner of an Esquire, and carrying a staff in his hand he reached the Seine, where he was forced to give his shoes to the boatman for his passage, and so go barefoot home.

William took part with Matilda against Stephen. After his death the surname of Lupellus seems to have become general among his descendants.—Richard his fifth son continued the line, and being nearly related to Earl Strigulph whose mother was like his, a daughter of the Earl of Mellent, he accompanied him in his Irish expedition—and was with <span class="smallcaps">Richard</span> in the Holy Land. I ought to apologize for the length of this note, but the history of this family seemed to me to present so good a view of the darker manners of the times, of the discourteous Barons against whom knight errantry was really useful, that I felt unwilling to curtail it.—Ascelin must certainly have been one of the greatest as well as one of the worst men of his time.&#160;<a href="#ref03-ii" rev="footnote" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>

§ Note (kk), page 115, line 688.&emsp;*And wondering wisdom warbled from his tongue.*

Pierre Vidal was one of those strange contrasts, so often met with in the history of the middle ages. The character of his muse was different, or he might perhaps bear a comparison with Alfieri, for while good sense and sound feeling reigned in his poetry, his life was marked by an eccentricity little short of madness. St. Palaye calls him the Don Quixote of Troubadours. The professed admirer of every beautiful woman, he believed himself equally the object of regard, and often boasted of imaginary favours. Having once indulged his vanity at the expense of a Provençal lady, her husband punished him by slitting his tongue. Hugues, the Lord of Baux, took compassion on him, and had him cured. He remained attached to the family, and soon became enamoured of Adelaide wife to Barrai de Baux, the head of the house. His whimsical passion was a source of great amusement to this lady and her husband; and the latter, far from being jealous of his extravagancies, gave him arms and habits like his own, and allowed him the freest access to his wife. Adelaide on her part pretended to return his love: but being soon disgusted with the presumption which her affected smiles inspired, she forced her husband to dismiss the unhappy minstrel, who while exhaling his sorrow in verses which are yet remarkable for their sweetness, sought consolation in war, and went with Cœur de Lion to Palestine.

The bravadoes in which he announced his prowess were not less extravagant than the complaints in which he breathed his love. “My enemies,” said he, “tremble at my name, and the earth shakes beneath my steps. All that oppose me I cut to pieces.”

It may well be believed that such a character was a source of great amusement to the young Knights who accompanied our Lion-hearted Monarch, and they alternately amused themselves with feeding and exposing his follies. During the King’s residence in Cyprus, they contrived to marry him to a lady, who appears to have been distantly related to some one of the families which had sate on the throne of Constantinople. They persuaded him that she was niece to the Emperor, and was to have the diadem transferred to her. No more was needful to heighten Vidal’s eccentricity to madness. He usurped the Imperial state and title, gave that of Empress to his wife, had a throne carried before him, and expended all his earnings in support of his Utopian dignity. Nay, so incurable was this fancy, that five and twenty years after, he
succeeded in collecting a little troop as mad as himself, and made a crusade to Constantinople, in the hope of recovering his empire.

But perhaps the most ridiculous proof of his wildness, was that elicited by his passion for Louve de Penautier, a lady of Carcassonne. As her name signified a female wolf, he thought himself bound not only to assume in her honour the name of *Loup*, but to wear the *wolf*-skin also, and in this disguise to be hunted by his own dogs, whom he would not permit to be called off till he was at the point of death. The lady’s compassion prompted her to dress his wounds, but she laughed with her husband at his folly.

This folly, however, scarcely ever touches his writings, and the moment that the muse possessed his fancy, she seems to have inspired him with a discrimination and prudence, which it would have been well if he could have carried into the affairs of life. His tale of the Jongleur not only gives admirable lessons to the young Troubadour for his conduct in the world, but some hints by which his patrons might be benefited. He also composed a treatise on the government of the tongue, an invective against Philip Augustus for not redeeming the Holy Sepulchre; another against the King of Spain, for buying peace from the Moors instead of subduing them. He complains of the conduct of the priesthood, and the encouragement given to heresy by their bad lives. And, finally, he launches into invective against the Emperor Henry the Sixth, for detaining <span class="smallcaps">Richard</span> in prison, against the faith of nations and the privileges of Crusaders. In short, his themes were various, and generally handled with power.&#160;<a href="#ref03-kk" rev="footnote" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>

There is little temptation to enlarge on the melancholy picture presented by the last years of the kingdom of Jerusalem. Amalric was a brave soldier, and might have made his power respectable, but his avarice and inconsistency ruined his cause. The blind passion with which he sought to obtain the wealthy dominion of Egypt led him into long and useless wars, while at the same time he had the inconceivable folly to sell some of his strongest fortresses to the Saracens and the next moment to break the peace formed with them, if the slightest prospect of advantage was held out from another quarter. His son Baldwin the fourth was only thirteen when Amalric died, and was afflicted with leprosy. Raymond of Tripoli became Regent during his minority, but his reign from the first hour of its commencement was disturbed by the dissensions of his nobles. As Baldwin grew up to manhood he took the reins of government into his own hands and signalized his brief authority by the complete defeat of Saladine near Ascalon. But his spirit and activity gave way beneath a fresh attack of disease; an unworthy jealousy of the power and commanding character of Raymond led him to prefer Lusignan as Regent, and he soon after died, leaving the crown to Baldwin the Fifth, the infant son of Sybilla, and William of Montferrat. The events immediately subsequent have already been noticed in the First Book.&#160;<a href="#ref03-nn" rev="footnote" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>

The humanity of Saladine, and the cruelty of <span class="smallcaps">Richard Cœur de Lion</span>, are phrases which must be familiar to many of my readers.—It is not my wish unduly to exalt the character of my hero, neither would I rob the Conqueror of Jerusalem of one well earned laurel. His conduct to the vanquished in the City deserves the highest praise, and is an instance of that generosity of which the history of the East offers so many striking examples, and which does not in those climes appear incompatible with acts of the greatest cruelty in the same individual. Rinaldo of Chatillon was the object of peculiar resentment to Saladine. Raised by the preference of Constantia, widow of Raymond of Poitiers, to the throne of Antioch, he was for many years the captive of Noureddin. When he regained his freedom, Bohemond, the son of Raymond, was old enough to govern his dominions, and Constantia was no more. Rinaldo married the widow of Humfrey of Thoron (father to the Thoron who appears in the poem) and thus became Lord of the impregnable fortresses of Carac, and Krak or Montroyal. From this latter place he ravaged the frontiers of Arabia, and when peace was concluded with Saladine, still continued his incursions. Saladine remonstrated to the King of Jerusalem, but Baldwin the Fourth had not power to punish or restrain his vassal. Rinaldo who had often plundered the caravans of Mecca and Medina, now conceived the bold project of penetrating even to those cities, and of pillaging the Caaba and the Tomb of the Prophet. Assisted by a band of Templars, he surprised the Egyptian merchants, who were conveying along the Red Sea, the treasures of India, and entered triumphant into countries which had never yet beheld the Christians. He reached the valley of Rabid, about ten leagues from Medina, where he was attacked by a Syrian army and defeated. Rinaldo and a few others escaped as by miracle to Krak. Part of the prisoners were executed as criminals, and we have the authority of the Arabian historians, Schahabeddin, Tabari, and Aboul-Feda, for stating that the rest were immolated at the same time with the victims sacrificed at the ceremony of the Grand Beiram. This horrible execution did not satisfy the vengeance of Saladine, and he invaded Syria, incessantly repeating the vow to kill Chatillon with his own hand. It was not, however, till the battle of Tiberias, that this daring warrior fell into the hands of the Soldan, when the circumstances of his death are faithfully given in the poem. The day after the battle witnessed a scene which was still less in accordance with the humanity ascribed to Saladine. He caused such of the Knights of the Temple and of St. John, as were among the prisoners, to be led before him, and declaring, that he “would deliver the earth from those two abominable races,” he permitted the emirs and doctors of the law, who surrounded him, to kill each a knight. Loaded with chains and incapable of resistance, these devoted warriors disputed with each other the honour of first receiving the crown of martyrdom, and many who had never belonged to the military orders, cried aloud, that they were Templars or Hospitallers, and gloried in partaking their fate. Saladine, seated on his throne, beheld and applauded the execution.&#160;<a href="#ref03-oo" rev="footnote" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>

After the battle of Tiberias, in which Lusignan was taken prisoner, Jerusalem, under the orders of the veteran Baléan D’Ibelin, made a more resolute defence than could have been expected from its destitute condition; but was at last forced to surrender. The Latin historians remarked that the Crusaders had entered the Holy City on a Friday, at the very hour when their Saviour submitted to death to atone the crimes of man. The Saracens re-took the town also on a Friday, the Mahommedan day of religious observance, and, according to their belief, on the anniversary of the day when their prophet arose from Jerusalem on his miraculous journey to Heaven: but an eclipse of the sun, which took place at the moment the conditions of surrender were adjusting in the tent of Saladine, was regarded as an evil omen.&#160;<a href="#ref03-pp" rev="footnote" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>

Some of the most splendid monarchs of Persia belonged to the Seljoukian dynasty, which expired in the year 1194. The kindred Sultan of Roum, whose capital was first at Nice, and afterwards at Iconium, rent many of its fairest provinces from the Greek empire, and maintained itself till 1308. It is from this branch of the Seljouc Turks that the Ottomans now upon the throne of Constantinople are descended. The Seljouc dynasties of Caramania, of Aleppo, and Damascus, were of shorter date. The last was that of Damascus, which city was given up to Noureddin by Ayoub, the father of Saladine, who was then Vizir to the last Seljouc prince, Modgireddin Abe. Ayoub had been under great obligations to Noureddin, and his brother, Shiracoush, was then in his service. The Sultan rewarded them both with liberality, and Ayoub received the government of the yielded town as the meed of his treachery. These two emirs were also endowed with the peculiar privilege of sitting in the presence of Noureddin, without waiting for permission.&#160;<a href="#ref04-b" rev="footnote" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>

These towers were similar in nature to those employed by Godfrey at the siege of Jerusalem, and even in an age when we hear familiarly of the destructive powers of our modern artillery, there is something imposing in the account of such gigantic engines; these were higher than the walls of the city, and each was capable of containing five hundred men. They consisted of three stories: in the first story were the battering rams; in the second, the Balistæ and Catapults, which threw darts and stones to the distance of one hundred and twenty-five feet. The stones were from three hundred to four hundred pounds weight; they crushed the roofs of houses, overturned the machines of the enemy, and shook the walls: the third and last story contained one hundred warriors, who were armed with axes, maces, &c, and protected by a roof from the stones and fire which were hurled from the engines of the besieged. It was also provided with a *pont levis*, or flying bridge, which could be let down upon the walls. These moving castles were raised upon wheels, and covered with leather hardened in vinegar, to render them impenetrable to common flame, and to the ordinary Greek fire. After the earth had been levelled, and a part of the fosse filled up, they were rolled forward by means of levers.

§ Note (f), page 138, line 121.&emsp;*To shivering want his own rih mantle gave.*

The banners of France were three, the royal or personal standard of the King, the “Chape de St. Martin,” and the oriflamme. The royal standard was a square banner, or gonfalon, of a blue colour, and powdered with lilies of gold. This was usually entrusted to some vassal of valour and consequence, who was called the gonfalonier, a name in later years confined to him who bears the standard of the Holy See. At the battle of Bouvines, the standard of Philip Augustus was borne by Gallon de Montigny, who, when the King was unhorsed, gave notice of his danger by lowering it several times. The “*Chape de St. Martin*,” according to Le Gendre, was a banner of taffeta, on which the Saint was depicted, and which had acquired extraordinary virtues, from having been allowed to remain some time upon his tomb. Other writers assert that it was the mantle of the Saint, and some have pretended that it was worn by the Kings of France in battle. Others suppose it to have been the banner belonging to the Abbey of St. Martin of Tours, and others again contend that it was not a banner, but a coffer or portable pavilion, containing the relics of many saints, and among others those of St. Martin, which the Kings of France held in the highest veneration. Whichever of these opinions may rest on the best authority, the presence of the Chape de St. Martin was supposed to ensure victory, and its place in battle was immediately after the royal standard. The oriflamme has been already considered, but the dignity of bearing it was sought by the most renowned knights, and contested with almost as much eagerness as the principal command, at least if we may judge from the instance of Arnoul d’Andrenhem, who under Charles the Fifth resigned his office of Maréchal of France, that he might exercise that of *Porte Oriflamme*. The bearer, however, had no authority, except over the troop at the head of which he carried his banner; but that troop consisted of all which chivalry could boast, of most noble and most valiant:—added to which, the oriflamme was always in the van, either in march or in battle, consequently in the post of danger and honour; and when it was present, even the banner of the King became of small account, and was called only the royal pennon. Nothing can more decidedly mark the respect in which the oriflamme was held, than the oath administered to the bearer. “You swear and promise, on the precious body of Christ Jesus, here present, and on the bodies of Monseigneur St. Denis and his companions, here also, that you will loyally, in your own person, guard and govern the oriflamme of our Lord the King, also present, to the honour and profit of himself and his kingdom, and that you will not abandon it, neither for the fear of death nor for any other cause, but that you will in all things do your duty as beseems a good and loyal knight towards your Sovereign and liege Lord.” — See *Mailly*, vol. i.&#160;<a href="#ref04-f" rev="footnote" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>

§ Note (h), page 144, line 257.&emsp;*He moves not, speaks not, lives to pain alone.*

The general suffrage of mankind seems to have established Saladine as the greatest man of the age in which he lived; yet in the power of supporting any reverse of fortune, he shewed himself much inferior to his antagonist, <span class="smallcaps">Richard Cœur de Lion</span>. Some historians have said that the English Monarch was never so great as in his dungeon of Trivallis; but the Sultan of Damascus, whether from mental weakness, or constitutional infirmity, seems to have been sunk into a deplorable state of despondency by every defeat. The picture in the poem goes not beyond that which is drawn by his annalists, and after the loss of Acre, we have the testimony of the learned Abdollatiph to that morbid state of mind, which would not admit even the presence of his sons. This great physician, after having acquired by travel a knowledge of the learning and antiquities of India and Damascus, was then on his road to Egypt, and felt it a point of duty to pay his respects to the Sultan *en route:* but the unhappy Monarch was in a state which precluded his admission. M. Michaud’s observations on the general character of Mahomedan courage are not inapplicable to this subject. “The reader may have remarked, in perusing this history, that the religion of Mahommed, all warlike as it is, does not inspire in its disciples that obstinate bravery, that perseverance under misfortune, that unbounded devotion, of which the history of the Crusades offers so many examples. The religion of the Musulmans requires the stimulus of victory to preserve its strength and violence. Trained in the blind doctrine of fatalism, they are accustomed to regard success or defeat as the decree of heaven. Victorious, they are full of courage and ardour; but when vanquished they allow themselves to be cast down, and feel no shame in yielding to an enemy, whom they regard as the instrument of destiny. Their courage is rarely excited by the desire of acquiring renown, and even in the moments of their military ardour, it is rather the fear of punishment than the thirst of glory that detains them in the field. The power to brave their foes must be derived from a chief whom they dread, and despotism appears necessary to their valour,” — Vol. ii. p. 213.&#160;<a href="#ref04-h" rev="footnote" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>

The strength of Ah, who wrenched off one of the gates of Bosra, and used it for a shield, appears beyond belief, and the exploits by which Kaled acquired the surname of “Seif-Allah,” or the “Sword of God,” are not less wonderful. Ali was vindictive and ambitious, and his struggles for the Caliphate led to that great schism, which has separated Persia from the standard of Mahomedan orthodoxy. Kaled seems to have been without ambition, ferocious, and delighting in battle for its own sake. The enthusiastic character and marvellous achievements of the companions and successors of the Prophet, gives to Mr. Gibbon’s account of the origin of Mahomedanism all the interest of romance.&#160;<a href="#ref04-i" rev="footnote" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>

This vase has long been lost. Giamschid was the son of Caiomurs, the first of the Preadamite Sultans, who reigned over the Genii before the creation of man.

§ Note, (l), page 149, line 350.&emsp;*And vanish’d in a pyramid of light.*

The idea of this incident is taken from a passage in the *Histoire de Saladine*, which says that many fruitless attempts had been made by the besieged to set fire to the wooden castles of the besiegers, or to overturn them with stones. Saladine promised great rewards for their destruction; at last a young man of Damascus flattered himself that he would burn them by means of an inflammable matter of which he possessed the secret, and which was different from the common Greek fire. In reality, after having mixed various drugs with naptha or petroleum, in brazen vases, these vases were hurled against the castles, and consumed them in an instant. Michaud says that they were reduced to ashes, as though they had been struck by the lightnings of Heaven. In the *Pièces Justificatives*, at the end of his second volume, is an extract fiom the MS. Life of Saladme by Renaudot, which bears upon the subject. “It is certain,” says M. Renaudot, “that the artificial fire, called Greek fire, *feu de mer*, or liquid fire, whose composition is found in the Greek and Latin historians, was very different from that which the Eastern nations began to use at this period, and of which the effect was the more surprising, as its саusе was entirely unknown; for, while the common Greek fire was prepared with wax, pitch, sulphur, and other combustible matters, the principal ingredient of this was naptha or petroleum, of which there are natural springs in the neighbourhood of Bagdad, similar to those remarked by the ancients near Ecbatana, on the confines of Media, and in other parts of Реrsia. It appears probable that the Orientals first made use of it at this siege (Acre), and that the Christians, from its resemblance, called it also Greek fire, and believed it to be the same which was known throughout the Levant. The Greeks and Mahomedans afterwards continued to employ their respective fires, without communicating the secret to other nations. The Greeks distinguishing the naptha fire of the east by the name of *Median fire;* and the Latins confounding both under that of Greek fire, in the same manner as the Orientals afterwards gave the appellation of naptha to the gunpowder by which it was superseded.” M. Mailly enters into a digression on the subject of the Greek fire. Its effects are doubtless exaggerated; and, though I have availed myself in the Poem of such exaggerations, there are not perhaps many who will now seriously believe on the authority of some old historians, that it consumed the very stones, or that, while the tendency of all other flame is to aspire, this had at least an equal inclination to burn downwards. M. Mailly, whose work was published in 1780, states that some of his contemporaries had pretended to a re-discovery of its composition. It was not ten years before that a person named Dupré, had died in the receipt of a pension paid him by the French Government on condition of burying his secret in oblivion. Mailly had himself known a physician, who had made the same discovery, or at least one similar, but to whose labours the ministry gave no encouragement, “a humanity,” he adds, “as honourable to philosophy, as to our country; the only one perhaps, where persons in place may be found, sufficiently the friends of mankind, to forbear multiplying the sources of their destruction; and to remember, that if unhappily wars are sometimes necessary, infernal secrets should be left to infernal armies, and that we already possess too much, in the use of gunpowder!!” The English Government would certainly have drawn upon itself the anathemas of M. Mailly, and have afforded a fine field for the display of his national vanity by its patronage of the Congreve rockets, had they then existed.&#160;<a href="#ref04-l" rev="footnote" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>

§ Note (p), page 164, line 706.&emsp;*Protects the mole, the shelter’d port commands.*

The form of Acre is triangular. It is defended by the sea on the north, western, and southern sides, and on the northeast or land side is guarded by walls and strong towers. At the northern extremity, or apex of the triangle is the Tour du Diable (Satan’s Fort). In the middle of the line, and at a projecting angle, is the Tour Maudite (Accursed Tower), the scene of the most violent assaults. At the south-eastern extremity, very near to the sea, is the Tower of David, or Tour du Patriarche; beyond this the wall extends a short distance into the sea, and is terminated by a small fort to which I find no distinguishing name. The sea encroaching on the southern side, or base of the triangle, forms a sort of bay defended by a mole, which springing from the shore near the southwestern corner, stretches half across, and is bounded by a strong tower, built on an insulated rock. This rock was formerly the site of a temple of Jupiter, and the place where the priests retired to inspect the entrails of the victims. From the number of flies which were hence attracted to the rock arose its name of Tour des Mouches. I have endeavoured to retain the pleasanter part of the idea, and have called it the Tower of Sacrifice. I may perhaps here be permitted to make a short observation on the names of Acre and Ptolemais, respecting which much has been written. The former name, or at least such modification of it as arises from the different pronunciation in various languages, seems to have been both the ancient and modern appellation of the city, and it has been questioned whence it acquired that of Ptolemaïs. Some writers have suggested that this last name, though employed by the Greeks of the Lower Empire, and the Latin authors, may never have become general among the natives of the country. Vinesauf, I think, gives a satisfactory explanation. The old town of Acre, as appears from the remains of its walls, did not occupy more than the lower half of the triangle, and Vinesauf says that to the north or on the side nearest to the hill of Turon, was that part of the city called Ptolemais, having been more recently built.&#160;<a href="#ref04-p" rev="footnote" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>

To the left of the mosque, on the north of the city of Acre, are the ruins of a building still known by the name of King <span class=”smallcaps”>Richard’s</span> Palace. Dr. Clarke calls its architecture gothic, and from the representations which I have seen, the arches are decidedly pointed. Two lofty arches and part of the superstructure remain; the cornice is ornamented with enormous stone busts, of very distorted countenances, whence the building has derived its name; these being supposed to represent the heads of the Saracens whom the Lion-hearted Monarch killed, or ate, according to the romance. Dr. Clarke thinks it more probable that it has been a church of St. John the Baptist, and erected during the time when the Christians were in possession of Acre, whether before or after its capture by Saladine.

These were incessantly filled with warriors from almost every nation of Christendom.

Conrad of Montferrat first visited Palestine at the time of the second crusade, when his father with his four sons accompanied his uncle, the Emperor Conrad the Third, on that unfortunate expedition. He afterwards distinguished himself in Italy in the contests between the Emperors and the Holy See, conquered some of the Islands of the Adriatic, which he sold to Venice, and then passing a second time to Constantinople, he assisted Isaac Angelus to establish himself on the imperial throne, having killed in battle the leader of the rebels. The sister of this monarch was at first a bait for his ambition, but finding that his marriage gained him nothing but the title of Cæsar, and the right of wearing purple slippers, he left the unhappy Theodora, and sailed to Palestine in quest of more substantial laurels. He arrived at Tyre in a single ship, on the very day when it was engaged to surrender to Saladine if not relieved. The Sultan threatened to place the old Marquis of Montferrat, who had been some time his prisoner, in front of his army, and to expose him to the arrows of the besieged if the town did not surrender, but Conrad was either too well convinced of the humanity of Saladine to fear his threat, or was insensible to the appeal, and replied that if the Soldan were barbarous enough to cause the death of one who had surrendered on his parole, he should glory in being the son of a martyr. Tyre remained his own; he assumed the title of its Prince, and enlarged its territory. Vinesauf says, that he had also another wife in Germany, high born and beautiful; I think her name was Emilia; but many of the heroes of the crusades would not have been sorry to claim at least one of the indulgences of the Mahommedan law.

Maurice, his eldest son, married Alice, daughter of Roger de Berkeley, and was one of the rebellious barons in the reign of John.&#160;<a href="#ref05-c" rev="footnote" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>

§ Note (d), page 189, line 313.&emsp;*To Acre borne, had made your valour vain.*

The Dromond was bound from Damietta to Acre. Both the European and Oriental writers vaunt its magnitude, and the importance of the stores which it contained. It was said to hold corn sufficient to supply the city of Acre for twо years, besides great quantities of Turkish bows, of urns with Greek fire, and, among other ammunition, of venomous serpents, which were destined to sting or bite the Christians to death. To modern ears, this seems an extraordinary weapon of offence, as the serpents might be perverse and bite the wrong party; it is possible that these were some warlike engines, bearing the form or name of serpents, though the other idea is not unworthy of the fancy, which supposed <span class="smallcaps">Richard</span> to have brought to Acre no less than thirteen ship loads of bee-hives, the denizens of which did good service against the besieged. See the Romance:

> Kyng <span class="smallcaps">Richard</span> into Acre’s cyté<br>
> Leet keste the hyves gret plenté.<br>
> It was hoot in the someres tyde,<br>
> The bees bursten out on every syde,<br>

A similar incident occurs in the history of the Caliph Vathek, where Carathis introduces small pots of venomous serpents into her apartments, to destroy her unsuspecting visitors. The Oriental writers agreed, that if the Dromond had arrived in safety, the Christians would never have been able to take Acre. The Romance has the same idea:

I cannot give a better idea of <span class="smallcaps">Richard’s</span> magnificence, or of the joy of the Crusaders on his arrival, than by quoting two passages from Vinesauf, the former of which describes his entrance into the harbour of Messina, the second his appearance in the bay of Acre. After observing on the necessity of splendour in princes, *qualem te video, talem te esse spero*, and the disappointment of the Messinese, who on going out to meet Philip at his arrival, found him in a single ship, like a fugitive, and hastening to hide himself in his castle, as though he feared the sight of men; the chronicler continues: “ Porro Rex Angliæ ille magnanimus, ex quo fama prædicante divulgabatur adventare, catervatim ruunt populi, ilium cernere cupientes; et in littus se ingerentes certatim occupant sedes ilium ascendentem visuri. Et ecce eminus prospiciunt mare galeis opertum innumeris, et vox à longe intonabat in aures eorum tubarum reboantium, et lituum clarius et acutius resonantium, interea propius accedentibus fuit videre galeas seriatim remigantes, variis undique ornatas et refertas armaturis, ventilantibus ad aurum innumeris penuncellis, et signis, ordine decoro, in hastilium summitatibus; rostris galearum varietatibus picturarum distinctis, appensorum in singulis proris, scintillantibus radiis scutorum, videres ex multitudine adventantium remigantium mare fervescere, tubarum intonationibus, quas trumpas vulgo dicunt, audientium aures tinnire, et ex vario tumultuantium acessu delectationem excitari. Cum ecce rex magnificus juxta navigantium galearum catervatim obsequio stïpatus, cæteris eminentiori et ornatiori præstans in prora, tanquam ignota visurus, sive ab ignotis videndis fertur in littus obsitum densarum turbarum agminibus, et omnibus tanquam se ultro videndum exponens, eleganter ornatus in littus ascendit, ubi nautas, quos eo præmiserat, cum cœteris addictis obsequiis suis reperit, eum gratanter excipientes, et dextrarios, et equos suos nobiles, sibi pridem commissos ad vecturam exhibentes.

It was on the day of St. Barnabas, or of the summer solstice, that <span class="smallcaps">Richard</span> appeared before Acre. The whole army advanced to meet him, and the earth shook with the exulting shouts of the Christians, while the Turks, who heard their trumpets and acclamations, were deprest and terrified. “Duo Reges à portu sese mutuo deducentes gratanter officiosis alter utrum venerabantur obsequiis.

Henry the Second of England, son of the above named Geoffrey, was the first of our Kings who bore the name of Plantagenet.

Of the immense booty which fell into the hands of the first Crusaders, at the battle of Antioch, nothing was so highly prized, or excited so much admiration, as the superb tent of Kerboga, King of Mosul, one of their principal antagonists. It was adorned with gold and silver in every part, was of such vast extent as easily to contain two thousand men, was divided into streets, and defended by towers, like a fortified town. This tent, the only one perhaps of the kind which had been seen siпсе the time of Constantine, who caused a similar one to be constructed, became the property of Bohemond, who sent it to Bari in Italy. — *Mailly, &c*. — The crusading Princes appear to have quickly caught a taste for this oriental luxury, and their small and clumsy tents were soon improved upon an Eastern model; though they never attempted to vie with this pompous specimen of Asiatic luxury, which will remind the reader of the tent given by the fairy Paribanon to her lover Achmed, in the Arabian Tales. Another splendid tent is named by the historians of the first crusade; it was sent by an Armenian Prince, Nichosias, as a present to Godfrey, but fell into an ambuscade prepared by Pancrates, who sent it to Bohemond, as a gift from himself. Godfrey reclaimed it, and it became the subject of much altercation between the two leaders, till Bohemond was at last compelled to yield.&#160;<a href="#ref05-k" rev="footnote" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>

This river formerly so celebrated for its silicious sands, and the accidental discovery of glass, is joined near its mouth by another river, which being figured in some charts as a separate stream, doubts arose as to which really deserved the name of Belus.

§ Note (r), page 212, line 825.&emsp;*A thousand marks proclaimed to him should lure him home.*

I avail myself of this incident to notice a characteristic difference between the third Crusade and those which preceded it. Louis the Seventh of France, and the Emperor Conrad, followed the track of Peter the Hermit and Godfrey of Bouillon. They had to contend with all the fatigues of a long and difficult journey, with all the miseries of famine, and all the dangers arising from open hostility and secret treachery; in Hungary, Bulgaria, and the Greek provinces bordering on Constantinople. These evils redoubled, when, passing into Asia Minor, they became entangled in mountain passes, and exposed to the incessant attacks of the Turks, under the dominion of the Seljouc Sultans of Iconium. Scarcely a third of their numerous armies reached Palestine, and those who did not perish in the journey, or whose sufferings did not cause them to turn back before they attained the Holy Land, arrived there in a deplorable state of exhaustion and poverty. Destitute of provisions, of money, frequently of arms and clothing, warriors of high birth, and ample European possessions, were often reduced to subsist on the charity of wealthier or more provident leaders; and all were in need of assistance. Frederic Barbarossa, whose lamentable expedition forms a part of the third Crusade, still pursued the beaten track; and even the courage and ability which had been displayed in a long life of war, could not save himself and his army from the fate of their precursors. Philip Augustus and <span class="smallcaps">Richard</span> of England, however, took warning from the sad example, and emulating the adventurous spirit displayed by the Norwegian Sigurd, and other warriors of the Baltic, they dared to entrust themselves and their armies to the ocean, and hired for the voyage the galleys of Genoa and Piso; for Venice, though then the first of maritime powers, took little part in the crusades, till her own interests were attacked in the contest for Constantinople. Some dangers were encountered in the course of the voyage, part of which may be reckoned among the ordinary casualties of the sea, but of which the greater proportion should be ascribed to the imperfection of the galleys, and to the ignorance of pilots. Still the French and English crusaders encountered neither toil nor privation, and the nobles transported into the East the comforts and many of the luxuries of their feudal castles. The passion for the chase, which then began to rage in France, and had even shewed symptoms of its future dominion in England, prompted many to carry with them their hounds and their falcons. The hunting equipages of several were even scandalously magnificent, and the Syrian nobles thought that their new allies seemed better prepared to wage war with the wild birds and beasts of their country, than with the Saracens. The numbers of dogs and falcons belonging to some individuals is almost beyond belief, and Philip Augustus was determined not to be outdone by his vassals. The bird whose loss is mentioned in the poem, was the subject of a serious embassy to Saladine, the conditions of its restoration were debated with all the solemnity of a treaty, and a sum of money was offered, which would have been sufficient for the ransom of many Christian knights. A fact which gave just offence to those whose relations or friends were prisoners to the Soldan.

The private interests of Philip Augustus, and the lukewarmness or disagreement of other princes, prevented the third crusade from being equally glorious in its result with that of Godfrey, but it was distinguished by more of discipline and conduct, and was free from those disasters, those deplorable scenes of human vice and suffering, which cause the mind to revolt from the history of almost every other expedition to the Holy Land. In the preceding crusades, the examples are distressingly numerous, and, in those which followed, the names of Constantinople and Damietta are sufficient to prove that the leaders of the Latin armies, brave and pious as they were, had not yet learned to be generals. When I saу that I ascribe the less disastrous issue of the third crusade to the influence of <span class="smallcaps">Richard Cœur de Lion</span>, I shall perhaps raise a smile, and be thought unduly partial to my hero, but the consideration of this subject will be more in its place when I have occasion to speak of the march to Arsouf, and the battle of Jaffa.&#160;<a href="#ref05-r" rev="footnote" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>

Knights were divided into two classes, Knights Bannerets and Knights Bachelors: no man being properly a Knight Banneret, who could not bring into the field a certain number of lances, from fifty to twenty-five, this last was the lowest number; he had also a right to a war cry, which other knights had not. He was distinguished by the square banner, carried by a squire at the point of his lance, whereas the Knight Bachelor had only the cornet or forked pendant. When a Banneret was created, the general cut off the ends of his pendant to render it square, but this honour conferred no command except over his own dependants. Olivier de la Marche makes a distinction between the Bachelor created Banneret on account of his estate or merit, and the hereditary Banneret, who took a public opportunity of requesting the Sovereign to unfold his family banner, which he had before borne wound round his lance: the first was called *réleve bannière*, the second *entrer en bannière*. Sir John Chandos was still a Bachelor when he led part of the Black Prince’s army into Spain, and first raised his banner at the battle of Navarette, where it was *unfolded, not cut*. — See *Hallam’s Middle Ages*.&#160;<a href="#ref06-j" rev="footnote" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>

That of Carrio, perpetuated in the Carews of Cornwall and Devon, was derived from a fief which William inherited in right of his mother.—This family is by some antiquaries derived from the Dukes of Tuscany, who are said to have passed from Florence to Normandy, but its descent appears pretty well established from Othoer, a powerful lord under King Alfred, and of Norwegian ancestry. Gerald, great grandson of Othoer, was sent by Henry the Second against Owen Rhys, Prince of Gwyneth or North Wales, whom he reduced to submission, and was made Castellan of Pembroke, under Montgomery Earl of Pembroke, Having also slain Owen, son of Cadugan ap Blethyn, chief Lord of Cardiganshire, he was made president of the county of Pembroke, chamberlain to the King, and married the Princess Nesta, daughter of the vanquished Prince of Gwyneth. His second son, Maurice, was the principal person by whose aid Ireland was conquered, and distinguished in most of the principal actions there. From him descended the Fitzgeralds, Dukes of Leinster, Fitzmaurices, Earls of Kerry, and the Fitzgeralds, Earls of Desmond (now extinct); of the same stock were the Geralds, Earls of Macclesfield (now also extinct); the Lords Gerald of Bromley, the Geralds of Bryn, in Lancashire, and many other noble families of the same name.

The “Letters from Tripoli” contain many distressing relations of the manner in which Georgian and Circassian girls are kidnapped by the Tartars, and hurried across the desert in sacks slung on the back of a camel. Many die on the journey, or never recover their fatigues, though they are afterwards fattened with the greatest care, and instructed in such accomplishments as are considered most marketable. Of these stories the most interesting is that of Lilla Haluma, who after many sufferings was sold to Hadgi Abderahman, afterward ambassador in England; and by her beauty and gentleness not only induced her master to marry her, but to grant her many indulgences not often accorded to the Moorish females, and among others, that of receiving intelligence from her native country, and relieving the wants of her family, who had fallen into distress. Many of the poorer Georgians educate their daughters expressly for the Turkish market, and themselves dispose of them to the Tartars.&#160;<a href="#ref06-n" rev="footnote" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>

## Book VII

<a id="note07-a"></a>
§ Note (a), page 273, line 36.&emsp;*Thou hold’st my life as dear as thine to me.*

The speech of Philip Augustus is very nearly that which history ascribes to him; there appears little doubt that his sickness was affected, and that his religious ardour having never been great, his reasons for returning to Europe were purely political. These were the death of Theodoric Earl of Flanders, in consequence of which the Earldom reverted to his Suzerain, but which he was in danger of losing, if not at hand to take care of his interests; and the convenient opportunity which the absence of <span class="smallcaps">Cœur de Lion</span> afforded him for attacking his ill-defended states, and gratifying the jealousy with which he regarded the superior wealth and martial fame of his rival. The friendship of Philip Augustus had been fatal to <span class="smallcaps">Richard</span> while only Count of Poitou, for it led him into rebellion against his father, and his hatred in after life was his perpetual bane. The Crusade produced a faint and false accord; each had bound himself by the most solemn oaths to a participation of peril, of glory, and of conquest; to defend as his own the possessions of his comrade, both at home and abroad; and the Church had rivetted these vows by the most deadly imprecations on all that should violate “the Peace of God.” Yet were all these vows made but to be broken; real friendship needs no such covenants, and it has been ever obvious that the most solemn engagements are as wax before the flames of ambition. <span class="smallcaps">Richard</span> and Philip were seldom together for three days without a quarrel; and though, as at Messina, the influence of the Holy Cause terminated these discords by a renewal of their vows, yet, as Michaud observes, there could be but little faith in a friendship which it was necessary to obtest so often. As soon as <span class="smallcaps">Richard</span> arrived at Acre, the contest about Cyprus rekindled the sparks of jealousy, and the two Kings never once joined their forces against the foe; the most that could be obtained was that, one should attack the army of Saladine while the other assaulted the city; but on more than one occasion, as has been already noticed, Philip would have retired with disgrace before the Soldan, if Richard, forgetting his animosity, had not withdrawn his troops from the town and redeemed the victory. His martial superiority was thus rendered but more manifest. It was the duty of each leader to support his troops: and the monthly allowance which <span class="smallcaps">Richard</span> granted to each man, was one-third more than that bestowed by Philip. It was natural that all who lived upon “debateable land” (and when we remember how many of the fairest provinces in France belonged to <span class="smallcaps">Richard</span>, these could not be few), should be eager to profess themselves the followers of the most munificent master: Philip therefore accused <span class="smallcaps">Richard</span> of seducing his soldiers from their allegiance. In a word, he had less irritability than the English Monarch, but as he also wanted his frankness, he seems never to have forgotten their former discontents, even at the moment when he again pledged an inviolable friendship; and when envy was in secret rankling in his heart, new grounds for quarrel could never belong absent.&#160;<a href="#ref07-a" rev="footnote" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>

§ Note (b), page 273, line 54.&emsp;*Again to pledge the vows of Vezelay.*

Vezelay is a small town in Burgundy, not far from Auxerre, and was the place where Philip and <span class="smallcaps">Richard</span> met to make final arrangements for the crusade. The vows taken at Vezelay were nearly the same as those by which the Crusaders, at the council of Clermont, bound themselves to abstain from all private or Christian warfare, and by which all the Princes and Nobles became reciprocal guardians of each others dominions during the crusade; such as might remain at home, or might return before the rest, pledging themselves to respect the rights of the absentees. Philip and <span class="smallcaps">Richard</span> made a further agreement, that neither should abandon the crusade without the consent of the other; it was hence that <span class="smallcaps">Richard</span>, when that consent was asked, required as a condition that Philip should again bind himself not to commit any outrage on his undefended states, of which his eagerness to return made him justly suspicious; and that Philip, in reply, demanded the renewal of <span class="smallcaps">Richard’s</span> homage for the extensive fiefs which he held of the French crown; so extensive, indeed, that when it is remembered that neither Burgundy, nor Lorraine, nor Flanders, then belonged to the Kings of France, it may well be asked, on what pretensions they founded their right to the title of “King of Kings,” and first of the Monarchs of Europe.&#160;<a href="#ref07-b" rev="footnote" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>

This memorable expression has been ascribed to <span class="smallcaps">Richard</span> by the historians of the times, though they differ in their account of the occasion which called it forth. Some say, that during his residence at Jaffa, he penetrated, on one of his romantic hunting excursions, to a hill whence he had a distant view of the towers of Jerusalem. He was then preparing to return to Europe, and the Holy City seemed to upbraid him with his want of power to relieve her, and with his meditated desertion of her cause. He wept, and veiling his head in his mantle, exclaimed, “that those who could not deliver, were unworthy to behold her.” Other writers address this expression, as I have done, in reproach to some of his companions, who deserted their vows for the deliverance of the sepulchre.&#160;<a href="#ref07-c" rev="footnote" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>

<i class="fa fa-info-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> Note (d), page 275, line 98.&emsp;*Paid the dire forfeit of his broken word.*

This is the least graceful feature of King <span class="smallcaps">Richard’s</span> life, and that which I have felt most difficulty in managing. To have passed it over entirely, would scarcely have been allowable, but after much consideration, I determined to touch it as slightly as possible. I could not hope to imitate Mr. Southey’s extraordinary power of identifying myself and my feelings with those of the age or country of which I treated, neither could I expect or wish, in the nineteenth century, to obtain the sympathy of my readers in an attempted extenuation of massacre. Yet it would surely have been as unjust to <span class="smallcaps">Richard</span>, as it was inconsistent with a story of which he was the hero, to hold forth to the detestation of posterity, an act not only excused, but applauded by the fanaticism of his contemporaries. The facts were briefly these: when Acre was surrendered, about 4,000 captives remained in the hands of the two Sovereigns, <span class="smallcaps">Richard</span> and Philip. A treaty had been entered into with Saladine for the payment of a large sum of gold, the surrender of the wood of the True Cross. &c. &c. on condition of which they were to receive their liberty: but if he failed to fulfil the treaty before a certain day, their lives were forfeit. The day expired, the conditions were unfulfilled; a good deal of fruitless negotiation followed, which only led to mutual exasperation; and, after waiting three weeks, Richard, who was preparing to commence his march, gave orders for the massacre. The numbers who are reported to have fallen vary from 1,500 to 4,000 or 6,000; I am inclined to think the lowest number the most correct. Many of the more wealthy had been already ransomed, or were reserved for ransom; and Philip, who had in the meantime departed to Tyre, took *his* share of the captives with him. <span class="smallcaps">Richard</span> often sent for them, but he who was about to leave Palestine seemed rather inclined to obtain money for their freedom, than to strike terror by their murder, and if at last he gave them up to his rival, it does not appear that he did so previous to the massacre. Aboulpharagins says, “that the time being expired, Saladine sent to the Franks, ‘Dismiss all the Arabs who are in your bonds, and I will give you the third part of the gold, and hostages for the other two; or otherwise, ye shall give me hostages for the third part which ye have received.’ But the Franks said, ‘Our word alone is sufficient to you, and our honour: why should we give hostages?’ Then the heart of Saladme was hardened, neither would he consent, and the Franks being enraged, bound all the Arabs with cords, and leading them forth from the city on to the hill, having clothed them in vile garments, they ran upon them with drawn swords, and slew them in sight of the Moslem camp.” The author of the Life of St. Louis relates the event in a manner which lays the first guilt of massacre on Saladine, and implicates Philip in the retaliation inflicted by the Christians. “Cinque mille hommes qu’il y avoit de garnison demeurèrent prisonniers, à condition d’être relachés en faisant rendre la vraie croix, et les esclaves Chrétiens: sinon qu’ils demeuroient à la discretion des vainqueurs. Mais *Saladin, ayant fait mourir un grand nombre des prisonniers qu’il avoit de son côté*, bien loin de tenir la capitulation, ces 5,000 hommes eurent tous la tête tranchée, *un moitié an nom de Philippe, et l’eutre au nom de <span class="smallcaps">Richard</span>. Ce fut Eudes, Duc de Вourgogne, qui ménagea cet honneur à la France avec tant d’exactitude*.” The Romance of <span class="smallcaps">Cœur de Lion</span>, which by its naïveté renders amusing those scenes of horror which would otherwise disgust, increases the number of the captives to 60,000, commands their destruction by the voice of an angel, and dwells with peculiar pleasure on the edifying effusion of Pagan blood. At the same time it is not sparing in its abuse of Philip, whom it accuses of avarice in liking better to
receive ransom for his prisoners, than to follow the good example of putting them to death. I ought not to omit, that Saladine was certainly not slow in making reprisals on the Christian captives in his hands; and Mr. Sharon Turner, in his admirable sketch of the Third Crusade, relates an interesting anecdote of a young warrior whom the Soldan kept for two days with him in his tent, conversing with him, and endeavouring to convert him, or to find some reason which might excuse to his own bigotry the disposition which he felt to exempt him from the fate of his companions. At last he gave orders for his death, an instance of cold blooded cruelty, of which Mr. Turner seems to think, that Richard, ferocious as he has been deemed, would have been incapable.&#160;<a href="#ref07-d" rev="footnote" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>

There were at least three embassies sent to Conrad at Tyre; of these the Bishop of Salisbury, Otho of Burgundy, and Roger de Quincy, Earl of Winchester, formed part; but as the several negotiations are not important to the story, I have mentioned but one, and engaged in it those personages that best suited my subject. The Bishop of Beauvais was certainly with Conrad at the period when he was engaged in treaty with Saladine, He was one of the most distinguished for valour among the martial prelates of thе age, but he did not, like Hubert of Salisbury, and the venerable Baldwin, Archbishop of Canterbury, combine the clerical virtues with the prowess of a warrior.

The historians of the time are followed in this arrangement of the troops. Whatever was most precious moved in the centre, surrounded by the knights of England and Normandy; while the auxiliary cavalry, if I may so call the smaller troops belonging to other nations, formed the front and rear, and the infantry protected the flanks. The Templars and Hospitallers frequently exchanged places, but one was always in advance of the army, while the other formed the rear-guard. They were engaged in constant skirmishes with the infidels, especially after leaving Cesarea, and many acts of signal valour are recorded. The disposition and conduct of the troops in this long and difficult march, though not one of the most splendid achievements of our lion-hearted King, is among those which have gained him the greatest credit in modern times, and proves that in his military arrangements, he was not deficient in that prudence which has so often been denied to him. He is allowed to have been the first who in the age of chivalry consented to make use of infantry as a body, and who knew how to place it to advantage.&#160;<a href="#ref07-f" rev="footnote" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>

Its prickly leaves wound the horses, and, if torn, their acrid juice is still more distressing in its effects. It is not easily cut down, and it will not burn. It does not however appear to have been so common in Palestine in the twelfth century, as to cause any inconvenience to the Crusaders. Mrs. Tully, in her admirable Letters from Tripoli, admires the beauty of its red and yellow blobsoms, which she describes as hanging like festoons on the edge of its gigantic leaves.&#160;<a href="#ref07-k" rev="footnote" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>

The history of the sugar-cane is curious, indigenous in Egypt, and cultivated with success in Syria, in Cyprus and Rhodes, this important plant was first made known to Europe by the Crusades. The soldiers of Raymond of Tholouse in 1098 discovered it in the neighbourhood of Tripoli, and when the march to Jerusalem was determined, they were with difficulty torn from the novel luxury. The mode of extracting the sugar was simple, but appears to have been efficacious. The inhabitants, when the canes were ripe, pounded them in a mortar, and then permitted the juice to coagulate in a cake “whiter than salt or snow.” The “*Canna Mellis*,” as it was called, (the Crusaders seeming to consider its juice as another species of honey) was soon transplanted into Sicily, where it appears to have flourished, and to have given rise to the extravagant passion for sweetmeats which existed in Italy in the fourteenth century, and of which traces may yet he found in the Carnival. Egypt was the principal source whence this consumption was supplied. From Sicily the culture of the sugar-cane passed to Grenada, thence to Madeira, and from Madeira to Brazil, whence it spread over the New World.&#160;<a href="#ref07-l" rev="footnote" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>

§ Note (m), page 279, line 181.&emsp;*All lovely yet appear’d that chosen land.*

The present appearance of Palestine corresponds so little with the glowing description of “a land flowing with milk and honey,” or with the bunch of grapes which attested its fertility to the Children of Israel, that most of the writers on the Crusades have thought it necessary to enter into some details respecting its past and present state. A long and narrow tract of sandy coast, bounded by rocks and deserts, and but imperfectly and partially watered by mountain torrents, which, while they spread lavish fertility in their immediate neighbourhood, leave the rest a waste, conveys no adequate idea of the Land of Promise; the chosen Land, which was selected by Divine Will as the residence of his favourite people; the scene of his miraculous interpositions in their behalf, and finally the incarnation of his Son, and the redemption of mankind. The religion of Mahommed, like the locusts which visit most of the regions in which it predominates, seems to spread devastation in its course. The comparison maybe fanciful, but it is true, that while Christianity is on every side ameliorating the face of nature, in the same proportion that it improves the social condition of mankind, draining the bog, levelling the mountain, overcoming the rigour of the frozen north, or the drought of tropical climes, Mahommedanism, the religion of war, of oppression and cruelty, has been long at strife with the bounty of nature in some of the fairest portions of the globe. Even the provident labours of their ancient cultivators are neglected and despised. The canals of Egypt are suffered to go to decay, nor can the diminution of that belt of verdure which still clothes the bounteous Nile, warn the careless and oppressed inhabitants to oppose in time the encroachments of the desert upon that Granary of the Ancient World. In Palestine, the descriptions of the Crusaders seem to present a middle point between its former beauty and its present state of neglect. It had suffered much and often, from war and pillage; and the martial spirit of feudal discipline in a kingdom struggling for existence was nearly as unfavourable to the husbandman, as the rapacious inroads of the Turks; yet there had been intervals in which it had revived, and its beauty, though blighted, was not destroyed.

I cannot resist the temptation of subjoining to this note the comment of a literary friend. “The fertility of that country depends upon moisture and shade; humidity is encouraged by trees, it has never been observed that the fatal and *predestined* blow was given to Palestine by Titus. To frame those immense works with which he assailed the capital, he cut down gardens, groves, and forests, for many leagues around. Deprived of shade, the ground has ever since remained scorched and barren, for no attempts were or could be made to replant, &c. This, in a word, is the reason of the barren state of the country.”&#160;<a href="#ref07-m" rev="footnote" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>

The heliotrope, so much admired for its fragrance, was the sunflower of the ancients, and the flower into which Clytie was supposed to be transformed. It is said always to turn its blossoms to the sun, and to follow him through the skies: but this “fond idolatry” is so much more conspicious in the common American sunflower, which has in addition the advantage to resemble the object of its adoration, that it has sometimes caused confusion; and a celebrated Italian artist, in painting the story of Clytie has introduced the sun-flower instead of the heliotrope.

The country between Cesarea and Jaffa is one of the most difficult and dangerous which an army can have to struggle with. On the left is that prolongation of the chain of Lebanon, known by the general name of Mount Sharon, though in parts it borrows that of Napolose, of Sichem, and other places in the vicinity. A straggling forest, composed entirely of cerrial oak, extends over the sides of the hills, and sometimes approaches very near to the sea; the intermediate space is broken by rocks and torrents, whose stony beds are scarcely less difficult to cross in the summer, than their furious waves in winter. A French traveller (M. Paultre) compares this tract to that extraordinary region in the neighbourhood of Fontainebleau, which any of my readers who have had a taste of its cross-roads cannot fail to remember. Large blocks of calcareous stone, grey without, from the effect of weather, but white at their more recent fractures, protrude on every side through the soil, and force the stunted trees to assume a thousand ungraceful forms. Indeed they appear rather the remains of a nobler forest, crushed by these gigantic masses, than to have sprung up around them. The forest of Sharon, of Arsouf, of Napolose, of Ascalon, or of Jaffa, for it bears all these names, is about six and thirty miles long, and from seven to nine broad. Many recent writers on the subject have exerted themselves to prove that this is the spot whence the leaders of the first crusade derived materials for the construction of their warlike engines; and which Tasso has embellished with so much of romantic fancy. Their arguments appear to be well supported; the situation of the wood of Sharon answers with tolerable precision to that of the Enchanted Forest, which was formerly supposed to have had no existence but in the imagination of the poet; and the idea derives new force from its being the only place within any probable distance from Jerusalem which could have afforded timber for the purposes of the siege. The more the Poem of Tasso is compared with the history of the time, and the geographical localities of Palestine, the more does his scrupulous accuracy become manifest: an accuracy the more surprising when it is remembered how much less of foreign countries or of ancient history was generally known, than in our more enlightened days, and that perhaps few of his readers would have detected or condemned any departure from historical truth.&#160;<a href="#ref07-s" rev="footnote" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>

It has already been observed, that this forest is entirely composed of cerrial oak; *Quercu Cerris*. The trees glowing in a shallow soil, near the sea, and scarcely ever receiving a due poition of moisture, do not attain any great size. Their appearance announces extreme age, yet their height does not exceed twenty-five or thirty feet, while eight or nine inches is the diameter of their stems. Their growth is seldom upright, and their summits affect an orbicular form, like that of trees which have been pollarded. The wood is very hard, the stems are knotty, yet the bark is smoother than that of our English oak: the leaves more shining and less deeply indented, the acorns large, and with a cup unusually wide. M. Paultre observes, that the scales which cover the cup are not rounded, as in our European acorns, but pointed and bent back in a sort of volute, which has acquired for this tree the name of *Quercus Crinita*. He compares the general appearance ot the forest of Arsouf to the straggling woods on the gravel hills of Lower Burgundy. — See *Michaud, Pièces Justificatives*. Other writers describe the Quercus Cerris or Turkey oak, and the Quercus Crinita, hairy cupped oak, or Burgundy oak, as distinct species, but the Oriental oaks in particular do not seem to be accurately known.&#160;<a href="#ref07-t" rev="footnote" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>

§ Note (x), page 296, line 564.&emsp;*Till Heaven in thunder check’d his mad career.*

Alasia, or Alice, or as some have called her Adelaïs, Princess of France, and sister to Philip Augustus, was unhappily betrothed in infancy to <span class="smallcaps">Richard</span>, afterwards King of England, and was sent to the court of Henry the Second, to be educated for her future husband. When the Princess grew up, <span class="smallcaps">Richard</span> demanded his bride, but Henry would not yield her. <span class="smallcaps">Richard</span> rebelled against his father, and joined with Philip Augustus, who espoused his quarrel; the armies met at Gisors, and were on the point of coming to an engagement, notwithstanding the remonstrances of Pandulphus, the Pope’s legate, the same to whom King John afterwards surrendered his crown. The impetuous <span class="smallcaps">Richard</span> was not to he persuaded out of a quarrel, in which he felt that justice was certainly on his side, though his rebellion was a crime, and in the heat of his passion, he lifted his spear as if to strike the Legate. In the meantime a thunderstorm arose, and *the thunderbolt fell between the two armies*. This extraordinary circumstance, which may be naturally accounted for by the attractive influence of the polished arms and armour on the electric matter, was regarded as the manifest interposition of offended heaven. A peace was soon concluded; Henry consented to create <span class="smallcaps">Richard</span> Duke of Normandy, to acknowledge his right to the succession, which he had wished to alter in behalf of his favourite John, and to give up Alasia at a fixed time. The latter clause he never fulfilled. He also renewed his vow of the Crusade, while Philip Augustus, <span class="smallcaps">Richard</span>. and most of the Barons, took or resumed the Cross.

On <span class="smallcaps">Richard’s</span> accession, Philip expected that he should immediately marry the Princess; but his attachment appeared to be cooled. Philip resented this slight upon his sister, and the unfortunate lady, after having been the cause of many private altercations, was on the point of seeing herself again made the subject of open war. <span class="smallcaps">Richard</span> is however said to have given Philip a satisfactory reason for his change of purpose, in the discovery that his father had detained Alasia from him, on account of a criminal passion which he himself entertained for the young Princess. He gave proofs of her having even borne a son to Henry, and Philip was fain to close the quarrel; and to thank the knightly honour of <span class="smallcaps">Richard</span>, which prevented him from making the scandal public. Alasia was afterwards mentioned in the dispute at Messina, but she is never named as a cause of feud in the after-wars of the Kings, though they were undertaken by Philip, on pretext of recovering her dower of Gisors, and the Vexin, which <span class="smallcaps">Richard</span> would not yield.&#160;<a href="#ref07-x" rev="footnote" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>

§ Note (y), page 297, line 582.&emsp;*His name outshine the conquerors of the world.*

This extraordinary man was the Abbé Joachim, who after his return from Jerusalem retired to the mountains of Calabria, where he passed for a Prophet. In austerity of manners and life, he affected to emulate St. John the Baptist. His pilgrimage to the Holy Land had been blest with visions, and Christ himself had taught him to understand the Apocalypse, and to read there, as in a faithful history, all that was to pass on earth. The account of him may be found in Hoveden. He at last incurred the censures of the Church, but at the time of <span class="smallcaps">Richard’s</span> voyage he was in the full odour of sanctity, and the Monarch’s superstition was piqued to see the fancied saint. He did not however go to Calabria, but sent for Joachim to Messina, where he was questioned as to the result of the Crusade. Joachim said that Saladine was one of the seven heads of the Dragon in the Apocalypse, and predicted that Jerusalem should be delivered seven years after the conquest of the Soldan. “Why then,” said <span class="smallcaps">Richard</span>, “should wo go so soon?” “Your arrival,” replied the Hermit, “is very necessary: God will give you the victory over his enemies and make your name celebrated above the Princes of the Earth. This reply, which was more flattering to the vanity of <span class="smallcaps">Richard</span> than to the impatience of the Crusaders, gave especial umbrage to Philip, and possibly it was less his superiority to the superstition of his age, than his jealousy of the glory announced to his rival, which made him affect to despise the prophet and his predictions.&#160;<a href="#ref07-y" rev="footnote" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>

Amrou, a general of the Caliph Omar, won Egypt from the Emperor Heraclius, and in the place where he encamped (near to Babylon, which still existed) he built a new town, called *Mars Fostat*, the City of Tents, in which the governor of the province afterwards resided, till Egypt was conquered by Djouhar, in the name of Moez, the Fatimite Caliph who reigned in Africa. Djouhar awaited in his camp the arrival of his master. He caused it to be surrounded with a strong wall, which was soon filled with palaces and mosques, and grew into a town, which he called Kahira, or Al Kahira, the Victorious (corrupted by the Christians into Cairo), and Mars Fostat thenceforward went by the name of Old Kahira. Saladine, after his establishment in Egypt, determined to build a wall, which should enclose both the new and old town. This labour was continued during his life principally under the eye of Karacous, who was governor of Kahira, till summoned to the defence of Acre: but the successors of the Soldan neglected to complete it. Saladine also raised a superb mosque over the tomb of the Imam Shafei, founder of one of the principal orthodox sects of Islam, and added to it an hospital for the poor, and a college for theology, history, poetry, medicine, and arithmetic; at the same time he constructed the Castle of Kahira, or the Castle of the Mountain, the only place of defence which now exists in Egypt. It was celebrated for its extent and magnificence, and the ruins which still remain are interesting. The arches are pointed, Joseph’s Well is another monument of the reign of Saladine, and was called after him, for the Soldan was proud of his name of Yusuf, or Joseph, which he inherited from his grandfather, and he loved to trace his descent from the Patriarch himself. — See *l’Histoire de Saladine, &c.*&#160;<a href="#ref08-b" rev="footnote" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>

§ Note (g), page 319, line 282.&emsp;*And war she never sought, but well sustain’d.*

Saleh, the son and rightful heir of Noureddin, was but six years old when his father died, and fled for protection from Saladine to his uncle the Sultan of Mosul. Saladine was successful in every campaign, and Saleh, who feared to he given up to the victor, endeavoured to make peace with him. After the treaty was signed, and Saladine was in consequence preparing to withdraw his army from the siege of Aleppo, a young Princess arrived in the camp, escorted by a great number of slaves. She endeavoured to throw herself at the feet of the Soldan, but he who recognised the daughter of Noureddin, raised her, and inquired what she wished. She asked the safety of her brother, and the restitution of the fortress of Ezaz, which Saladine had recently won by a sharp siege. He granted her request with courtesy, and added many valuable presents. Some time after this, when Saleh and his protector the King of Mosul were both dead, Saladine continued the war; and Mazoud, son of the latter, being besieged in his capital, had recourse to the same means which had before moved the pity and blunted the sword of the conqueror. He sent the daughter of Noureddin, accompanied by his own mother and many noble ladies, to implore again the clemency of Saladine, and the restoration of the towns of Mesopotamia. This step was considered as a mark of the greatest submission, and from the humanity and generosity of the Sultan, its success was confidently anticipated. But Mazoud deceived himself. Saladine had found him too troublesome an enemy to let slip his prey in the very moment of success. He received the Sultanas with kindness, and with all the honours due to their rank; but intreaties and tears were vain; he was inflexible for the first time. On this subject M. Marin observes, “that to the political spirit of the present times it would appear surprising that a hero should yield his conquests at the tears of a few women, for they asked no less than the kingdom of Mesopotamia, Nevertheless, the manners of a nation which we are accustomed to call barbarous, caused the firmness of the Soldan to be regarded as an act of the greatest harshnesss. Many Doctors of the Law, although his subjects, dared publicly to reproach him in their writings, and it is remarkable that he himself repented of what he considered an act of inhumanity.” I have less authority for the martial character of the daughter of Noureddin. At the death of Baldwin the Third this noble Arab had replied to those who counselled him to invade Judea, “that it was inhuman to molest the grief of a people that deplored its master, and that he should believe his own glory tarnished, by the attack of those who were not in a condition of defence;” but when Noureddin himself died, Amalric did not think it necessary to imitate his generosity. His invasion of Syria, however, had not the success which he had anticipated. At Paneas or Belinas (Cesarea of Philippa), he was stopped by a woman. The widow of the Atabeg who had been its governor, defended the place with such spirit, that he was glad to hide his retreat by permitting it to he рurchased. I have ventured to give this exploit to Almahide. Saladme married either the daughter οf the widow of Noureddin, but it is uncertain which.&#160;<a href="#ref08-g" rev="footnote" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>

It has already been stated, that the House of Perceval, or Yvery, can trace its genealogy beyond the Conquest. Two of the family came to England with William, one of whom, Roger, was brother in arms with Robert D’Oyley, a noble Norman, and the friends bound themselves by mutual oaths to share each other’s fortunes. The conqueror rewarded the services of D’Oyley with the only daughter and heir of Wigod de Wallingford, a potent Saxon lord, and in virtue ot the agreement, Roger de Yvery obtained of his friend one of the honours, thenceforward called the Barony of Yvery in Oxfordshire. Roger had besides large possessions, and was Chief Butler of England, while some of his family held the same office in Normandy. In 1074, in conjunction with Robert D’Oyley, he founded the Church of St. George, in the Castle of Oxford, and in 1077, he also founded a Benedictine Monastery to the Virgin, near the Castle of Yvery, not far from Evreux in Normandy.

While the Gospel was carried in state before the leader of the Christians, the Koran, a Koran written under the auspices, if not by the hand of the Caliph Omar, was borne with equal ceremony in the ranks of Saladine, who would pause upon the field of battle to perform his stated prayers, or hear a chapter of the sacred volume.&#160;<a href="#ref08-o" rev="footnote" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>

The family of Courtenay, in the beginning of the thirteenth century, gave three Emperors to Constantinople; but this House, after having been raised to unexampled honours in Asia, fell, at least in France, into a decline as rapid as its elevation had been wonderful. The passion for crusading seems to have touched almost every branch of this noble family, und many were the martyrs whom it gave to the holy cause. Reginald de Courtenay, a very powerful peer, was in Palestine with Louis the Seventh, and was among those who vindicated the character of Eleunor of Guyenne, when charged by her husband with nuptial infidelity.

Among these Robert de Neuburg was distinguished. The others are Walkelin Earl of Ferrers, Robert Trusebot, Henry, Count of Champagne, Josceline de Montoirs, the Count of Clermont and Hubert Bishop of Salisbury. Conrad of Montferrat bears the odium of having at least increased this famine by withholding the provisions which it was in his power to furnish from Tyre; and Vinesauf devotes no less than twelve sections to s description of its horrors, concluding each with execrations against the obnoxious Marquis, towards whom, indeed, he never omits any opportunity of shewing his detestation. But while he gives so much space to the especial abuse of Conrad, he seems to have hated Leopold so completely as to wish to rob him even of the immortality of infamy, and notwithstanding his many gallant actions in the Crusade, he never once names, even in a catalogue, that arch-enemy of his own heroic sovereign.

The orthodox Mahommedans maintain that the torments of hell are of eternal duration, — *Sale’s Koran—Preliminary Discourse.*



[^1]: On the eastern coast of the Mediterranean is a small bay, of which Mount Carmel forms the southern extremity, while that to the north is occupied by the city of Acre. The plain, on the south, is watered by two rivers; the Belus, whose sands were sought from a great distance for the manufacture of glass, and the “ancient river, the river Kishon;” but like most of the Syrian streams, they roll a torrent in the Spring, and they nearly disappear in the Autumn. Acre, washed on two sides by the sea, is protected on the third by strong walls, and a succession of massy towers. The Christians, at the commencement of the siege, pitched their camp on the hill of Turon, to the north-east of the town; but this camp being enlarged by the arrival of successive bodies of Crusaders, it extended gradually from Belus to the sea, and almost matched the city in the strength of its ramparts. To the south-east, and a little more remote, but still within the Belus, is a conical hill, called Mahumeria, or the Hill of the Mosque, and by some writers, the Tomb of Memnon. Here were the headquarters of Saladine; but much of his army seems to have been encamped on the heights of Kaisan, and in winter it retired to the yet remoter mountains of Kharouba. Acre was therefore enclosed by the Christian army, which, in its turn, was enclosed by that of Saladine.

[^2]: “Neuf rangs de morts couvraient le terrein qui s’étend entre la colline at la mer, et chaque rang était de mille guerriers.” — <i>Michaud from Bahaheddin</i>

[^3]: Michaud, vol. ii. p. 70, in speaking of the Turkish mode of warfare in their inroads on the kingdom of Jerusalem, says, that when successful, they returned to their country loaded with spoil, and singing these words:— “The Koran is plunged in joy, the Gospel in tears.”

[^4]: The Emperor Conrad the IIId. of Germany lost his army, by the treachery of the Turks of Iconium, in the mountains of Armenia. Frederic Barbarossa overcame the Turks, but perished near the same place in the river Saleph, believed by some writers to be the Cydnus, whose icy waters had nearly proved fatal to Alexander the Great.

[^5]: James, Lord of Avesnes and Guide, was one of the most renowned captains of his age, and emulated the fame of his ancestor Gerard d’Avesnes, who had gained honour in the first Crusade. — *Maimbourg*.

[^6]: When Geoffrey de Lusignan heard that Sybilla had made his brother Guy King of Jerusalem, he replied, with more of frankness than fraternal affection,
“If she have made Him King, she would have made a God of me.”

[^7]: Isabella, married to Humfrey Count of Thoron, was the daughter of Amalric by his second wife, Mary, sister to Isaac Comnenus.

[^8]: Before Saladine released his royal prisoner, he bound him by and oath to resign all future pretensions to the throne of Jerusalem; but Lusignan was no sooner at liberty than his desire of vengeance awakened, and Heraclius made no difficulty of freeing him from his vow, declaring, not only that compulsory engagements could not be considered binding, but that it was meritorious to break such as were made with infidels.

[^9]: After the taking of Jerusalem, the crown was offered to Godfrey of Bouillon; but that pious leader declined it, saying, “that he would never wear a crown of gold in the place where his Saviour had worn a crown of thorns.” The title of First King of Jerusalem, which he bears in history, was bestowed on him by his comrades, but, I believe, never assumed by himself.

[^10]: The Count of Thoron must have been brave, since he is often spoken of in battle, and prudent, since he was frequently employed as an Ambassador; yet it is difficult to conceive how a man of any spirit could submit to the indignities which were put upon him. — Maimbourg says that he was extremely boyish in his manners. — Such a husband was not likely to suit with the high spirit of Isabella.

[^11]: The Knights of St. John, or Knights Hospitallers.

[^12]: *Deus id vult*, or *Dieu le veut*, the spontaneous burst of popular feeling at the Council of Clermont, and afterwards the well known war-cry of the Crusaders.

[^13]: “Que Dieu reste neutry et la victoire est à nous.” *Michaud* and others.

[^14]: Histoire de Saladin.

[^15]: This whimsical instance of the delirium of success is historical.

[^16]: The Latin historians ascribe the defeat of the Crusaders to this singular occurrence, and the confusion which it occasioned. The Arabians say, that the horse got out of one of the vessels, and was pursued. He took shelter with the Musulmans, who presented him to Saladine, which was regarded as an evil omen. See *Michaud, Morin, &c. &c.*

[^17]: The Green Knight, “*Le Chevalier aux armes vertes*,” seems to have excited no less interest by his valour, than by the mystery in which he was enveloped. He distinguished himself particularly in the defence of Tyre, under Conrad of Montferrat. “Lui seul, disent les vielles chroniques, il repoussait et dispersait des battalions ennemis; il se battit plusiers fois en combat singulier, terrassa les plus intrépides des Musulmans, et fit admirer de Saladin sa bravoure et ses faits d’armes.” *Michaud, Hist. des Croisades*. James of Avesnes would certainly have perished in this battle, but for the assistance which was promptly afforded to him.

[^18]: Frederic Barbarossa.

[^19]: Ralph, or Radulph of Hauterive or Altaripa, Archdeason of Colchester. He exerted himself nobly in the defence of the Camp against the attack of Omar.

[^20]: Vinesauf speaks of a savage nation who fought in this battle, with bodies as deformed as their minds were ferocious, black, of enormous stature, having red shawls on their heads instead of helmets, and bearing clubs set with fragments of iron.

[^21]: Guido, of Castelluno, and Lovel his brother.

[^22]: Anselmo, Lord of Karac and Montroyal.

[^23]: The Ribauds or Ribaldi were, as Marin expresses it, the Mamlukes of Philip Augustus; his body guard, composed of young men of family and of acknowledged valour. Throughout the Siege of Acre, they seconded every enterprize of their Monarch, and were foremost in every assault; but the memory of their dissolute habits survived their martial fame, and *Ribald* had long been a term of reproach.

[^24]: Josceline de Montmorenci.

[^25]: Drogo of Amiens, and Alberic Clement, the first who bore the title of Maréchal of France. Of the celebrated Hangest de Courcy, more will be said hereafter.

[^26]: The Princess here alludes to the circumstance mentioned in the note to line #141. That Isaac had been assisted in his attempt on Cyprus by Margaritus, Admiral of the King of Sicily, whose widow, the Matilda of the Poem, accompanied the Queen Berengaria. His exploits had gained Margaritus the surname of King of the Sea, *ou le noveau Neptune*.

[^27]: Albert has already been mentioned as having doubled the Cape of Amanthus, on which I believe some relics of the famous Temple of Venus are yet remaining. It is a bold promontory, on the south coast of Cyprus. Limisso, near which <span class="smallcaps">Richard</span> anchored, is to the west of the Cape; and Baffa, or Paphos, on its eastern side, and somewhat nearer. This tract is the most fertile part of the Island, which is on the whole mountainous.

[^28]: This fraudful embassy is spoke of by Vinesauf. He says that “Isaac sent presents of provision and Cyprus wine (whose like is not to be found in any other land) to the Queen, trying to persuade her to disembark. But she suspected his treachery, and refused, alleging her anxiety respecting <span class="smallcaps">Richard</span>: otherwise she would have been imprisoned.”

[^29]: At the Council of Clermont, which led to the first Crusade, all the crosses were red; but it was afterwards found convenient to have some national distinction in a war where all the nations of Christendom were mingled. The French, who had been foremost in the Crusades retained the Red Cross. The English wore it white, the Austrians blue, the Germans yellow, the Flemings green.

[^30]: The incidents of this battle have the authority of Vinesauf. Harcourt is meant to allude to his family motto, “*Le bon temps viendra*.”

[^31]: Some writers say that <span class="smallcaps">Richard</span> honoured Isaac with silver chains, in mockery of his own avarice; others that he asked for them. I have tried to combine the two accounts.

[^32]: The highest mountain in Cyprus bears the name of Olympus.

[^33]: And because Cyprus by antiquity was celebrated as the seat of Venus, that it might so prove to him, in the joyous month of May, he solemnly took to wife his beloved Berengaria.” — *Fuller’s Holy Warre*,” p. 121.

[^34]: At these feasts it was usual to lay a present on the plate of every quest, proportioned to the respect in which he was held.

[^35]: To eat on the same trencher or plate with any one was considered the strongest mark of friendship. At great entertainments, the guests were placed two and two, and only one plate was allotted to each pair. In the romance of Perceforest it is said, “There were eight hundred knights all seated at table, and yet there was not one who had not a dame or damsel at his plate.” — See Way’s *Fabliaux*, vol. i.

[^36]: “But those who wear the woodbine on their brow, Were knights of love who never broke their vow.” — *The Flower and the Leaf*.

[^37]: Colosso is a projection on the Cyprian coast, to the west of Paphos.

[^38]: The river Arga traverses the kingdom of Navarre, passing close by Pampeluna, and falling into the Ebro, which separates Navarre from Old Castille.

[^39]: Raymond Count of Sanctus Egidius, *Gallice* St. Gilles, was a descendant of the Raymond de St. Gilles who accompanied Godfrey to Palestine, and whose son became the first Count of Tripoli. He was consequently related to that Raymond of Tripoli whose death was described in Book I.

[^40]: Hugh Cyveilioc of Chester.

[^41]: Sir Richard *Le Forte* was a man of extraordinary strength and courage, in the time of William the Conqueror. At the battle of Hastings he bore a strong shield before the Duke, and contributed greatly to his preservation, he being often in imminent danger and having three horses killed under him. From the circumstance arose the motto with a double meaning, “Forte *scutum, salus* Ducum,” and the addition to the name Fort-escu. A shield is also the family crest.

[^42]: Robert Fitz Parnel, Earl of Leicester, son to Robert, who died on his pilgrimage. Fitz Parnel received intelligence of his father’s death during his stay with <span class="smallcaps">Richard</span> at Messina. He first unfolded his paternal banner at the battle of Arsouf, where he was much distinguished. Indeed his exploits in Palestine, in England, and Normandy, were second only to those of his Sovereign.

[^43]: Walter de Clifford, brother to the fair Rosamond.

[^44]: Botolph Stourton, who when the Conqueror entered in the West, was among those who broke down the sea walls of the Severn, and entering Glastonbury, guarded the pass by land till the Conqueror granted what they required.

[^45]: Turchil, son of Alwyne, was a powerful noble under Edward the Confessor. On the Norman invasion he gave no assistance to Harold, although he was then Earl of the County of Warwick, and hence grew into high favour with the Conqueror, who left him in possession of his lands, namely the Lordship of Compton, and forty-seven other manors. Turchil assumed a sirname in imitation of the Normans, and adopted Norman manners in every particular. Under Rufus he took that of Arden (from Arden in Warwickshire), which title descended to Siward his eldest son, while the second took that of Compton.

[^46]: In reversing the classical motto of Lord Rodney, “non generant aquilae columbas,” so as to give it a prospective rather than a retrospective sense, I trust not to have been thought to violate its true meaning. The Rodneys seem to have settled in England before the Conquest. Sir Henry Rodney was Steward to the young King Henry (son of Henry IId). His son, Sir Richard Rodney, was the one who accompanied his royal namesake to Palestine.

[^47]: See Ellis’s *Fabliaux* — The Mule without a Bridle.

[^48]: See Ellis’s *Fabliaux* — The Knight and the Sword.

[^49]: When Eleanor of Guyenne accompanied her first husband, Louis the VIIth of France, to the Holy War, she resided some time at Antioch, and is there said to have made acquaintance with a young Turk of the name of Saladine, and it has been supposed by some writers that this youth was the same with the great Saladine.

[^50]: Ten pieces of gold for each man, five for women, and two for children. Those who could not ransom themselves were to remain in slavery.

[^51]: This trait of generosity is historical.

[^52]: The daughter of Noureddin, when she solicited the Soldan to forego his conquest of the kingdom of Mosul. See note on Almahide to the eighth book.

[^53]: These were all in sight at once, and arrived on one day.

[^54]: See note on the Origin of the Order of the Garter, at the end of the volume.

[^55]: See note on the Mamlukes, Book I.

[^56]: This odious traffic is the indelible disgrace of Venice. It existed as early as the time of Charlemagne. The Pope interfered, and forbade at least the trade in Christian slaves; but while the markets of the Levant offered a ready sale, the captive and the kidnapped, of either sex, found his anathemas but a feeble defence. — *Heeren, “Sur l’Influence des Croisades,” &c*.

[^57]: “Great names, but hard in verse to stand.”

[^58]: The Accursed Tower is said to have owed its ill omened name to the circumstance that within its walls were coined the thirty pieces of silver for which Judas betrayed his Lord.

[^59]: Karacous was so much deformed as to have given his name to a kind of Punchinello, which still continues to amuse the people of the Levant.

[^60]: The celebrated apples of Istakar, which are said to be sweet on one side and bitter on the other.

[^61]: The Eastern nations made use of Clepsydra or water-clocks.

[^62]: This bridge is frequently named in Vinesauf, and was the scene of many skirmishes.

[^63]: The Hindoos as well as the Mahommedans are wont to use a string of beads to regulate the number of their prayers. The Hindu muntras or rosary is sometimes formed of the buds of flowers.

[^64]: The Knights Templar wore beards: a circumstance which distinguished them from all other military orders.

[^65]: The mantle of the Knights of St. John, or Knights Hospitaller, was scarlet with a white cross on the shoulder. After their expulsion from the Holy Land they changed the colour of the mantle to black, in sign of mourning.

[^66]: The Colocasis.

[^67]: See the opening of the third book.

[^68]: The manner in which the shields of the knights were ranged round the gunwhale of the galleys, when prepared for war, as well as the form of the wooden castle which it was usual to elevate at the prow when an action was about to commence, is shewn in that curious relic the Bayeux tapestry. In a MS. at the British Museum, of the time of Henry III, a vessel is represented as having a castle at the stern as well as the forecastle, which has evidently bequeathed its name to that part of a modern ship, although the castle itself has shrunk to a level with the main-deck.

[^69]: The eve of St. John; the dews of which are believed, in the East, to stay the progress of the plague.

[^70]: On the first of King Richard’s seals the shield bears two lions rampant. The second, which was engraved soon after his return from Palestine, is said to give the first example of the three lions passant gardant in pale. This was certainly his legitimate device. Henry II had five lions in his shield, but he gave two of them, with his eldest daughter, to Henry, Duke of Saxony, who was afterwards called “Henry the Lion.” The other three he kept for himself, and they have since been the acknowledged arms of England.

[^71]: In the hall where the principal personages who assisted in the siege of Acre met for council, three thrones were erected, for the Emperor of Germany and the Kings of France and England. I cannot distinctly make out whether Lusignan had at this time a separate throne, but he and Conrad afterward disputed that which had been intended for Frederic Barbarossa.

[^72]: Alasia, sister of Philip, to whom Richard had formerly been betrothed.

[^73]: Alluding to the thunderbolt which fell between the two armies, when Richard rebelled against his father, for the sake of this Princess his affianced bride, whom Henry detained from him.

[^74]: The antient name of Cairo was Fostat, till Dgîouhar bestowed on it that of Kahira, or “the Victorious.”

[^75]: The King’s illness makes a principal feature in the romance. Vinesauf calls the malady with which he was afflicted *Arnoldia*. It occasioned the loss of nails and hair; but I believe that the faculty have not yet been able to identify it.

[^76]: Historical; as is the subsequent speech of Saladine, which strongly marks the extent to which the Arabians carried their ideas of hospitality.

[^77]: See the “*Gerusalemme Liberata*,” Canto xviii, 49, 50.

[^78]: The name given to a species of burning dart, being a long stick of wood, tipped with combustibles, and hurled by the besieging engines.

[^79]: I need only refer the poetical reader to Mr. Southey’s Madoc. The real or supposed expedition of that Prince is placed in the reign of Henry II, after the battle in which Prince Hoel fell, and which determined the fate of North Wales.

[^80]: Baldwin, Archibishop of Canterbury, made a pilgrimage to Wales for the purpose of preaching the Crusade; and his journey is embellished by Giraldus Cambrensis with as many miracles and wonders as Amadis encountered in the Firm Island. The story of the young Elidorus, who lived some time with the Gnomes in their subterranean world, till he learned their language (which strongly resembled Greek), is a very pleasing fiction. Baldwin is said to have made many proselytes; and the ardour of crusading, which was new to Wales, began with nearly the same vehemence as in other regions; but it soon expired, and very few Welch were among the followers of Richard to the Third Crusade.

[^81]: See the Oration of St. Bernard at Vezelai; or Michaud, vol. ii., 124.

[^82]: Richard worked one of the Patrariæ for a considerable time.

[^83]: Vinesauf, who adds that the stone was picked up and sent to Saladine.

[^84]: See Hovenden, folio 395. The eclipse lasted three hours.

[^85]: At the time when Saladine approached the Holy City, after the battle of Tiberias, in which Lusignan was made prisoner, and at the moment when the deputies refused to surrender the town, a great eclipse of the sun “left all at once the heavens in darkness,” which was interpreted as an evil omen to the Christians.

[^86]: Historical.

[^87]: As in this Crusade each Chief was obliged to support his own troop, the leaders generally allotted a fixed stipend to each man.

[^88]: Leopold changed his armorial bearings after the siege of Acre. His original shield was, six Larks Or, in a field of Azure. The story is that at one battle during the siege, he fought so bravely that his armour was entirely covered with blood, save his belt, which remained white. In commemoration of this circumstance, the Emperor assigned to him and his successors their new device, Gules, a fess Argent.

[^89]: The sons of Esculapius may be interested to learn that this was no less a personage than Richard de Higel, Bishop of London, and the first who is mentioned as bearing the title of King’s Apothecary. In our degenerate days the functions of “soul-curer and body-curer” are not ordinarily thus united; but the clergy engrossed all the little learning of that semi-barbarous age, and the practice of pharmacy was not uncommon, even in the highest dignitaries.

[^90]: A large mantle or outer garment of dark brown cloth, which completely conceals the dress and rank of the wearer. These are worn by the women of the East when they go abroad. Those belonging to the lower classes are very coarse in their texture.

[^91]: This is a broad belt, formed of the choicest spices, and slung over one shoulder. The golden anklets are often massive to a very inconvenient degree.

[^92]: The Sarzar, a cold and fragrant wind, which, according to the Mahommedans, shall blow upon the last day, and destroy all living creatures.

[^93]: Nice, or Is Nik, the capital of Bithynia, is situated on the banks of the Lake Ascanius, now alled Ac Sou (*Eau blanche*). The inhabitants pretend that, when the waters of the lake are low, majestic edifices and massy towers are seen beneath the waves, the remains of a submerged city, which they suppose formerly to have occupied the site, and to have been destroyed by an earthquake. It is possible that this fable may have originated from the reflexion of the buildings of Is Nik in the water, but similar stories are not uncommon in the East.

[^94]: Israfil is one of the four Archangels; the angel of music, who is to sound the trumpet on the day of resurrection, and whose ravishing strains will delight the true believers in Paradise.

[^95]: In one of Mahommed’s battles many of his followers were grievously wounded: but, at the Prophet’s prayer, the plant from which the balm of Gilead or Tolu is obtained, sprung up like a grove, and their gashes soon yielded to the force of the miraculous balsam. The Suras are the divisions or chapters of the Koran.

[^96]: It was the custom for the vassal, when rendering homage, to present his sword to his Suzerain, and kneeling on one knee, with his hands between the knees of his feudal lord, to repeat the vow of fealty for such and such lands, saving his allegiance to some other lord for other lands and honours, or excepting such possessions as were unconditionally his own.

[^97]: Dr. Clarke speaks in admiration of this beautiful and stately plant. Indeed I have scarcely changed the words in which he describes it on his journey from Acre to Nazareth. A variety of this thistle has its leaves dappled, as though some white liquid had been spilled upon it. The legend which ascribes this peculiarity to the milk of the Virgin, which accidentally fell upon the plant, seems to have borrowed somewhat of the fanciful character of Pagan mythology.

[^98]: Ajax, who contested with Ulysses the armour of Achilles, and who, when the prize was awarded to his rival, became made and slew himself. From his blood sprung the hyacinth, which is said to have his name written on its petals.

[^99]: Ipsa tibi blandos fundent cunabula flores.<br>
Occidet et serpens, et fallax herba veneni<br>
Occidet;&emsp;\*&emsp;\*&emsp;\*&emsp;\*<br>
Molli paullatim flavescet campus arista,<br>
Incultisque rubens pendebit sentibus uva;<br>
Et duræ quercus sudabunt roscida mella.

[^100]: This fountain, frequently mentioned in the history of the Crusades, is about a mile to the south-east of Saphura, between the town and Nazareth. It was a place of rendezvous for the armies belonging to the Kings of Jerusalem, particularly during the reigns of Almaric and Baldwin the Fourth. *Clarke’s Travels*.

[^101]: Richard seems throughout his after life to have been actuated by a sincere repentance for his rebellion to his father. At his accession, he shewed no favour to those who had been his abettors, while he distinguished the faithful friends and counsellors of Henry. On one occasion he prostrated himself, clothed in sackcloth, to an assembly of priests and bishops, confessed his sins, submitted to their reproofs, and even to their scourges, and at last received their absolution.

[^102]: The nacaire, or long Saracen trumpet, was much used in the times of the Crusades. It is figured in Mr. Hamilton Smith’s Ancient Costume of England. The principal circumstances of the description in the poem are from the Arabic historians. The noise of drums and trumpets, and other martial instruments in the Musulman ranks, is frequently contrasted with the silence of the crusading armies.

[^103]: This was, in former Crusades, the general cry of the soldiers of Christ, but is named as having been particularly used by James of Avesnes in this battle. All the circumstances of his attack and death are historical.

[^104]: Andromeda is said to have been exposed to the monster on the rocks at Jaffa; and it was near Berytus that St. George conquered the dragon. The two stories have had their rise in the same allegory.

[^105]: Arnulph of St. Clair.

[^106]: Vigano de Cherbourg.

[^107]: Ascalon, often called in the East the “Bride of Syria;” that name is also given to Damascus.

[^108]: Osmere was the son of Elphege de Toketon, now Tufton.

[^109]: The arms of Grovesnor are a wheat-sheaf: those of Perceval, three white crosses on a field Gules; motto, “*Sub cruce candida*.”

[^110]: From Hamo is derived the family name of Amherst.

[^111]: This incident of a Templar renegade is on record.
