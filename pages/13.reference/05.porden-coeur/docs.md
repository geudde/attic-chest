## Ode tо thе King’s Most Excellent Majesty

Ruler of a happy Land!<br>
England’s far-descended King!<br>
Sprung from Him whose dreadful band<br>
Fought beneath the Raven’s wing:<br>
Whom his Cimbrian galleys bore<br>
To found on Neustria’s yielding shore,<br>
Beneath serener skies, a wider reign;<br>
Till, slighting realms so cheaply won,<br>
His brave Descendant launch’d anew, to gain<br>
Fair Albion for his Bride, and fill her Island Throne.

Sprung from those whom Britain’s call<br>
Summon’d in an earlier age.<br>
When her violated wall<br>
Felt the Pictish spoiler’s rage—<br>
Soon a milder, purer creed,<br>
Changed to white their sablе steed:<br>
Soon in one orb the sevenfold гаys combined;<br>
Her vanquish’d foes confest the flame,<br>
And England with her budding laurels twined<br>
Beyond the reach of Time, the wreath of Alfred’s fame.

Mourn not. if their mutual force<br>
Oft the plains in crimson dyed;<br>
If the Saxon’s generous Horse<br>
Stoop’d beneath the Lion’s pride.<br>
Thus two mountain springs descend,<br>
Thus their meeting waves contend:<br>
Long the fierce waters foam, and clash, and roar,<br>
Till to their strife the channel yields,<br>
Green turf and fragrant blossoms clothe the shore,<br>
And the broad tranquil stream spreads plenty through the fields.

With the broomy garland crown’d<br>
See the conquering Henry shine!<br>
<span class="smallcaps">Plantagenet</span>! that lofty sound,<br>
Blends the boast of either line,<br>
See the Silver Cross display’d<br>
O’er th’ impetuous <span class="smallcaps">Richard’s</span> head!<br>
On Syria’s holy plains, to win or bleed,<br>
Pours his devoted host along,<br>
While he, triumphant on his Cyprian steed,<br>
Scatters like morning clouds the misbelieving throng.

<span class="smallcaps">Monarch</span>! him I dare to sing!<br>
Him! thy kindred Henry’s son.<br>
From his gallant warriors spring<br>
They who late thy battles won.<br>
England now, from fields of strife<br>
Guards her Sovereign’s sacred life.<br>
Yet still aloft her star of glory shines;<br>
For He that late her Trident bore,<br>
And he to whom thy hand her Sword consigns,<br>
Shall mate with Arthur’s peers, and <span class="smallcaps">Richard’s</span> knights of yore.

Though no Cross their bosoms seal’d,<br>
Their march no mail-clad Prelates led;<br>
Sacred be each laurell’d field!<br>
In a hallow’d cause they bled.<br>
England’s thunders swept the sеа
That her brethren might be free;<br>
Nor for herself were fruitful regions gain’d:<br>
She the trampled fought to raise,<br>
And of a rescued world alone retain’d<br>
The honour of the strife, th’ imperishable praise.

Beneath Italia’s purple heaven<br>
Two gifted Sons of song divine<br>
To Immortality have given<br>
Thy parent Esté’s princely line;<br>
And ever when pale Cynthia pours<br>
Her radiance on its summer shores,<br>
Along the Adriatic’s listening waves<br>
Still sings the merry gondolier;<br>
His glistening oar to Roland’s glory laves,<br>
Or with Rinaldo woos some new Armida’s car.

Long may they sing—but shall not He<br>
Whom England proudly calls her own,<br>
Whose deeds of song and chivalry<br>
Once gave new lustre to her throne,<br>
One mellifluous strain inspire,<br>
Or rouse one warrior’s latent fire;<br>
Even as Himself could erst the gales invite<br>
To waft his bark to Syrian plains,<br>
Or call’d indignant from Trivallis’ height<br>
His lingering peers to loose their King’s ignoble chains? 

Say not Chivalry is dead;<br>
That her spirit charms no more—<br>
Noble souls still love to tread<br>
Paths of legendary lore:<br>
She speaks from every craggy steep,<br>
Yet crown’d with some embattled keep,<br>
Or stream that lave the Convent’s ruin’d cells,<br>
And in the Minster’s aisles of pride,<br>
Still many a sculptured Hero proudly tells.<br>
For her he bravely fought, for Heaven and England died.

She lives, while England is a name,<br>
While native in her sons shall spring<br>
That heaven-born zeal, that loyal flame<br>
Which binds her People to her King<br>
That zeal all selfish thoughts above<br>
Which lives but in its country’s love.<br>
Which seeks for Honour in the front of war,<br>
Which, as it stamps the Tyrant’s doom,<br>
Spreads with her rule the light of Truth afar;<br>
While Justice guides her sword, and Virtue guards her home.

<span class="smallcaps">Monarch</span>, hold that spirit dear!<br>
Prize the Muse that gives it fame!<br>
So, to some future Sovereign’s ear<br>
Shall Bards unborn thy worth proclaim,<br>
Or pausing on thy Father’s reign,<br>
Own their loftiest numbers vain,<br>
To picture one in every virtue blest;<br>
Who firm amid the tempest stood,<br>
Friend of the friendless, Champion of th’ opprest,<br>
Thine and thy People’s Sire—the Glorious and the Good!

Or how thine own majestic hand,<br>
Ending works so well begun,<br>
Led to an exulting land,<br>
<span class="smallcaps">Peace</span>, by noble daring won.<br>
Which long—but let not man presume<br>
To lift the veil of years to come,<br>
Suffice it that Eternal Wisdom sways.—<br>
That we to Heaven our eyes may cast,<br>
For present good our grateful anthems raise<br>
And wish that future years may but reflect the past.

To <span class="smallcaps">Thee</span>, of Arts and Song the Friend,<br>
Fearless the Bard her tribute bears,<br>
With vows for all that Heaven can send<br>
Of lengthen’d reign and prosperous years!<br>
And pardon Her whose minstrelsie<br>
Ambitious dwells on themes so high,<br>
Though haply she in vain the Muse may woo,<br>
And to thy footstool only bring<br>
A heart in every pulse to England true,<br>
True to her equal Laws, her Altar and her King.

## PREFACE

The greatness of an enterprize, while it increases the diffidence of an Author, almost destroys the right of apology. If, in attempting to celebrate the heroic achievements of <span class="smallcaps">Richard Cœur de Lion</span> in Palestine, and the events of the Third Crusade, I have ventured beyond my strength, I can only say that my fancy was captivated by the chivalrous and romantic spirit which breathes from every page of their history, and that in the wish to see them poetically treated, I forgot my own deficiencies, and also that much of the necessary information was to be derived from sources almost inaccessible to a female.

The character of <span class="smallcaps">Richard</span> has, I think, been a little unfairly delineated; and especially as respects his engagement in the Holy War. It is absurd to try the justice or the prudence of the Crusades by the feelings and opinions of the nineteenth century, and it is almost impossible to estimate what were or were not the advantages which Europe ultimately derived from its consequent intercourse with Asia. Every page of our old chronicles bears record of the darkness and ignorance which then enveloped even the most civilized nations of the West. Fanaticism and valour were the ruling spirits of the Middle Ages; and while we deplore the myriads of human victims that were sacrificed for the temporary possession of a narrow territory in Asia, we ought to remember that many of them would otherwise have fallen in feudal and intestine war, and that when the sword of bigotry reposed for a moment from the task of exterminating the followers of Mahommed, it was never without an object of persecution among the heretics of Europe. If <span class="smallcaps">Richard</span> drained his kingdom of its bravest warriors and riches treasures to lose them both in Palestine, in a contest which neither advantaged himself nor his realm, we must not forget that it was for the attainment of all which was then believed most precious; in obedience to an authority which he was taught to consider infallible; and to the still stronger voice of universal enthusiasm, which pointed out the pilgrimage to Palestine as the atonement for the greatest crimes; the certain path of salvation. The bravest Princes of Christendom were his comrades and his rivals, and had He only remained in Europe, his contemporaries would not have applauded his prudence, but have reproached him as a coward, and as a traitor to his honour and his God. He has been accused of shewing more of the brutal courage of a soldier, than the skill of a leader; but personal prowess was then esteemed as the noblest quality of a hero, and in that, <span class="smallcaps">Richard</span> excelled not only his companions, valiant as they were, but almost all the genuine warriors of antient days, and the Paladins of romance. It was not till after the departure of Philip Augustus from Acre, that <span class="smallcaps">Richard</span> became the leader of the Crusaders, and even then each independent chieftain arrayed his followers with more regard to his own interest and glory, than to the common good; yet the march to Arsouf, and the battle of Jaffa, are evidences that he both possessed and could exert the talents of a general; and the brief period of his stay in Palestine is almost the only page of the Crusades which can be read without horror, as it is the only one which is free from distresses and disasters of the most dreadful kind, and brought on by the most childish want of forethought and discipline.

With regard to his personal character. There are but two of the leaders of the Crusades that will bear the test of time. Godfrey of Bouillon, who was equally exemplary as a private soldier, a general, a monarch, and a christian; and Tancred, the perfect model of chivalry. Hume, in his History of England, has stigmatized <span class="smallcaps">Richard</span> as a bad son, a bad husband, and a bad king; but let us compare him with his contemporaries. The stains of rebellion, of rapacity, perfidy, and cruelty, are strong upon the names of his brother John, of Alphonso of Arragon, of Leopold of Austria, and Henry the Sixth of Germany. While we condemn his rebellion to his father, let us not forget his provocation and his repentance; as a husband, his history is at least unstained by the cold and inexplicable cruelty with which Philip Augustus treated for a number of years the most beautiful and accomplished Princess of her time; and if the indulgence of his martial genius impoverished his subjects, it endeared him to their hearts, and made the name of <span class="smallcaps">Cœur de Lion</span> the pride of England and the terror of Asia, A blind admiration of the Great of former ages, has been so often ridiculed, that we are now apt to run into an opposite extreme; they are like the fossil plants which we sometimes discover far beneath the surface; we know that our soil and atmosphere would not now support them, yet they once flourished there in appropriate use and beauty.

France was the cradle of the Crusades; and we have, till very lately, left it to the French to write their history. It has been remarked that the Monarchs of France and England never fought together in one cause, except at the Siege of Acre; and though the martial achievements and magnificence of <span class="smallcaps">Richard</span> be more congenial with the general taste of our Gallic neighbours, than the cool calculating policy of Philip Augustus, it cannot be matter of surprize that this circumstance should have peculiarly excited the feelings of national rivalry, to deepen the darker shades of his character, and to pass lightly over many traits of generosity and magnanimity. The jealousy of his comrades occasioned the Crusade to fail in its principal object of the re-establishment of the kingdom of Jerusalem, and their treachery rendered it a source of misery and civil conflict to England; but I cannot help thinking that had a longer life been permitted to him, he would have triumphed over his enemies, consolidated his power, and in the maturity of years and reflection, would have become one of the greatest monarchs in our annals.

The Latin kingdom of Jerusalem maintained itself not quite one hundred years. Of the multitudes that accompanied Godfrey, few contemplated a permanent expatriation, and when the object of their pilgrimage was accomplished in the redemption of the Sepulchre, they returned to Europe, leaving him to defend it with very inadequate forces. Yet the single year of his reign was a course of victory, and the code of laws which he caused to be compiled, has been considered as the best example of feudal jurisprudence. On his death, his brother Baldwin was called from the principality of Edessa to the vacant throne, and though the territory which he quitted was richer and more extensive than his new dominions; these were advantages not to be compared with the glory of reigning over the Holy City, and he cheerfully resigned his conquest into the hand of his cousin Baldwin du Bourg.

The avarice and ambition of the first Baldwin, had been a source of constant dissension among the Crusaders, and retarded the completion of their enterprize, but from the time of his accession, the brother of Godfrey proved himself not unworthy of his relationship. During a reign of eighteen years, with forces that seemed scarcely sufficient for the defence of his little state, he made it formidable to the Saracens of Syria and Egypt, and increased it to an extent which his successors were unequal to maintain. He died childless, and Jerusalem again looked to Edessa for a ruler, while Baldwin du Bourg, was succeeded in the principality by his cousin, Josceline de Courtenay.

The new king spent nearly the two first years of his reign in captivity among the Infidels; but the honour of his kingdom was maintained by his vassals, and with the assistance of the Venetians, he afterwards captured the important city of Tyre. As he had no son, he determined to chuse among the nobles of Europe a husband for his daughter Melesinda, and an heir to his crown. His choice fell upon Fulk, Count of Anjou; the father, by a former wife, of the House of Plantagenet; and who had already distinguished himself in a pilgrimage to Palestine. Fulk accepted the invitation of Baldwin, who expired after a reign of twelve years; and in him his subjects wept over the last of the companions of Godfrey, in whom they could find no fault, but that he was more of a saint than a hero. About this time arose the Knights Hospitallers, or Knights of St John, and the Knights Templars, afterwards the strongest defence of Jerusalem. But the power of the Christians was already beginning to decline; the virtues of Fulk were esteemed, but his faculties were enfeebled by age, and he left his sceptre to a minor.

The kingdom had hitherto subsisted through the weakness and disunion of the Saracens; they were now beginning to be united under formidable leaders, and in the reign of the Third Baldwin, Edessa was torn from the degenerate heir of Josceline de Courtenay, by Zenghi or Sanguin, Sultan of Aleppo, and his son, the celebrated Noureddin. The news of this disaster revived the enthusiasm of the West. The Emperor Conrad the Third of Germany and Louis the Seventh of France, accompanied by his wife Eleanor of Guyenne, (afterwards married to Henry the Second of England, and mother of <span class="smallcaps">Richard</span> and John,) led a force of seven hundred thousand warriors to the Holy Land. More than two-thirds of this immense armament perished through the ignorance and disobedience of its chieftains, the treachery of the Greeks, and the hostility of the Turkish Sultans of Iconium. The remnant besieged Damascus, but their valour was rendered vain by the jealousy of the Syriac Christians; and the Second Crusade was without one glorious action to atone for the appalling waste of human blood, or to vindicate tlie promises and exhortations of St. Bernard, which had tempted such multitudes from the bosom of their families. Soon after, in the midst of a succession of victory, Baldwin the Third died by poison, and was succeeded by his brother Amalric. A brave soldier but an imprudent king, he often purchased peace from the Saracens by the cession of some of the strongest bulwarks of his dominions, and then as foolishly violated the treaty bought so dear, whenever the arrival of a few straggling pilgrims from Europe held out the hope of obtaining some trifling advantage. He suffered himself to be involved in the domestic broils of Egypt, and afterwards sacrificed the interests of his kingdom to the chimerical hope of conquering that rich country.

The wars of Egypt were indeed fatal to Jerusalem, for it was in them that Saladine first learnt the duties of a soldier; and it is remarkable that Noureddin with difficulty compelled into the path of military renown, the man who was shortly after to pluck the sceptre from the hands of his son, and to become one of the greatest monarchs of the East. At his first campaign the unambitious son of Ayoub reluctantly quitted the pleasures pf Damascus, and the toils and perils of war were so little to his taste, that even the distinction which he acquired by the successful defence of Alexandria could not vanquish his disgust; and when the Sultan again ordered him to the banks of the Nile, he went, according to his own confession, with the despair of a man conducted to death. But after he had once fairly tasted the cup of glory his thirst became insatiable. The desire of empire and the triumph of the Koran annihilated every other passion, and the voluptuous youth became remarkable for the simplicity and even austerity of his life. His religious feelings were gratified by the deposition of the heretic Caliph of Саirо, and the restoration of Egypt to the orthodox faith of Islam. During the life of Noureddin, Saladine was contented to govern in his name; but at his death he raised the standard of revolt, won province after province from his children and his emirs, and then advanced to subdue Jerusalem, a city almost equally sacred in the eyes of a Moslem and a Christian. Gibbon has remarked that the successesi of Saladine were prepared by the circumstances of the times, and that he was seldom victorious when opposed by equal forces. It is also worthy of observation that he was unable to sustain the frowns of fortune. The loss of a battle or a friend sunk him into a state of despondency, from which he was only to be roused by the remembrance, that, according to the doctrine of his Prophet, all was predestined, and that it was impious to murmur at the Will of Alla. His character has derived a singular colouring from the mixture of severe devotion to a bigotted and cruel faith, with the feelings of a heart unusually generous and humane.

Jerusalem was a victim ready for sacrifice: Amalric left his crown to his son, a leper and a child, who died just as he was beginning to shew that he possessed talents worthy of dominion. His infant nephew survived him but a few months, and the kingdom, weakened by intestine broils, and exposed to a powerful enemy, remained in the insufficient hands of his sister Sybilla, and her husband, Guy de Lusignan, who had not even the prudence to conciliate those whom he pretended to govern, Or the good faith to observe a treaty with Saladine, which might have delayed for a few years the ruin of his power. He lost his army and his liberty at the battle of Tiberias; and Jerusalem, after a short resistance, submitted to the Soldan. The circumstances of its capitulation, and his generosity to the conquered, are detailed in the notes to the poem. Tyre was soon the only city of Palestine which remained to the Christians, and it was saved from sharing the fate of the rest by the opportune arrival of Conrad of Montferrat, with a few brave followers.

In the mean time the loss of the Holy City spread dismay in Europe. Some years previous, the Patriarch Heraclius had endeavoured to stimulate the potentates of France and England by the recital of its dangers; but the misfortunes of the Second Crusade were not then forgotten, and his intemperate harangues and infamous character were injurious to his cause. The venerable Archbishop of Tyre was more successful; and when he related the sad events of which he was afterwards to write the history, the brave and pious wept at the idea of the Saracens trampling on the Tomb of their Redeemer. Philip Augustus and <span class="smallcaps">Richard</span> sheathed on the field of battle the swords which were drawn for mutual warfare, and vied with the Emperor Frederic Barbarossa in their preparations for its rescue. Myriads hastened to take the cross, and to defray the expense of their equipment, the memorable tax of the
<i>Dixme Saladine</i>, or the tenth part of their rents and moveables, was imposed on all who remained behind. In the meanwhile the Soldan had released Lusignan from captivity, and as the hatred of Conrad had caused the gates of Tyre to be shut against him, he collected the few friends which still remained to him, and began the siege of Acre. Saladine advanced to its relief; successive bands of Christians, whose less splendid preparations had enabled them to outstrip the three great monarchs of Europe, arrived to reinforce the army of Lusignan, while that of the Soldan was continually recruited from Egypt, Damascus, and Aleppo; and the siege had continued nearly three years at the time when the Poem commences.

In this brief abstract I have merely attempted to recall to the memory of the reader a few of the principal events which preceded the action of the Poem. The recent publication of Mr. Mills’s History of the Crusades, has rendered more minuteness unnecessary. It is needless to say, that in a poem, much of fiction is necessarily blended, but where I have drawn from history, I have endeavoured to be correct For one great anachronism I must throw myself on the mercy of the critic, but it seemed to me otherwise impossible to preserve any unity of story without omitting the most romantic part of <span class="smallcaps">Richard’s</span> life.

It only remains for me to express my thanks to those friends who have assisted my labours. To Mr. Gifford, for the benefit which I have derived from his friendly criticism; and to Mr. D’Israeli, and Messrs. Longman and Rees, for the loan of many valuable books.

# Book I

While Britain’s annals shine with many a name,<br>
Her loftiest Poets might contend to sing;<br>
While British bosoms feed poetic flame,<br>
Why should Her Lyre with foreign praises ring?<br>
Not for my own, but for my country’s fame,<br>
Oh! make me worthy of my theme, and bring,<br>
Sweet Muse! thy noblest numbers, while I dare<br>
To blazon <span class="smallcaps">Richard’s</span> deeds, and <span class="smallcaps">Richard’s</span> Holy War.

In Honour’s fountain steep my Lyre, and give<br>
The great of distant ages to mine eyes,<br>
With all their martial pomp the dead revive,<br>
Heroic deeds and holy extasies;<br>
That they through long futurity may live,<br>
And breathe o’er unborn heroes as they rise<br>
The courteous grace, the spirit wild and high,<br>
The warm, romantic glow, of genuine Chivalry.

For, Britain! not in this thy noon of fame,<br>
Hast thou a son to noble hearts more dear,<br>
Than He, the terror of the Moslem name,<br>
Who on the deep thy White-Cross dared to rear<br>
And spread in Palestine, till it became<br>
The Christian’s day-star, and th’ Apostate’s fear,<br>
Who mix’d with martial deeds the minstrel lyre,<br>
He of the Lion-heart, the dauntless soul of fire.

## The Siege of Acre

On Carmel’s brow, and Acre’s placid tide,<br>
The crimson Evening’s latest radiance died;<br>
Warn’d by the thickening gloom of awful Night,<br>
The weary hosts suspend th’ unfinish’d fight,<br>
Each fainting Christian to his tent retires,<br>
And counts on either side the hostile fires,<br>
That from the towers of leaguer’d Acre shine,<br>
Or (stretch’d around,) the camp of Saladine.[^1]<br>
Since Salem’s exiled King begirt her wall,<br>
Since Asia’s Lord obey’d his people’s call,<br>
For three long years, in doubtful conflict tried,<br>
The scale of Victory bow’d to either side,<br>
Yet ne’er the sun on such a fatal field<br>
Had set, or saw so far the Christians yield;<br>
The Moslems sallied from th’ unconquered town,<br>
From Kaisan’s heights the Soldan thunder’d down,<br>
In vain they strove to stem the tide of fate,<br>
And crowds of Martyrs throng the heavenly gate;<br>
A strange mysterious terror seiz’d on all,<br>
Alike the feeble and the valiant fall;<br>
Nine slaughter’d ranks the purple plain o’erspread,<br>
And every rank contain’d a thousand dead.[^2]

The anxious warders in the camp below<br>
Mark’d a dense cloud on Carmel’s lofty brow,<br>
Portentous lightning flash’d; a sullen sound<br>
Of mutter’d thunder roll’d the mountain round,<br>
And lo! a sanguine meteor fires the air,<br>
Cleaves the dark mass and shrouds its brightness there;<br>
While the dun vapours and the clamorous din<br>
Declar’d that still it fiercely blazed within.<br>
With horror seiz’d, they tremble at the sign,<br>
And breathe in pious prayer the name divine.<br>
&emsp;Well might they tremble—there in close debate,<br>
A dark divan of hellish Genii sate.<br>
On that vast mount where in his lone abode<br>
The wrapt Elijah communed with his God,<br>
Where, when a crowd of impious Priests, in vain,<br>
With harpings loud and steam of victims slain,<br>
Invok’d their slumb’ring Baal from morn till even,<br>
The Prophet’s voice drew down the fire from heaven;<br>
In after times, Alkarmel’s Altar rose—<br>
Alkarmel,<sup>a</sup> fellest of Messiah’s foes;<br>
Though ne’er in walls his vot’ries dared enshrine<br>
His horrid vastness, or his: form define.<br>
But hence expell’d, by Mary’s vestal choirs,<br>
His sanguine orgies ceas’d and impious fires,<br>
Till now again he treads the hallow’d ground,<br>
And blasts the vines, and calls the Genii round;<br>
All that to punish or to prove mankind,<br>
Direct the plague, the earthquake, or the wind,<br>
Gild with false rays th’ Arabian Prophet’s name,<br>
Or bow before the fount of living flame;<br>
All that against the Son of God combine,<br>
To foil the Champions of his Holy Shrine.<br>
On flying columns borne of whirling sand,<br>
Speeds dark Demroosh from Zara’s burning land;<br>
From Libanus the snowy tempest brings<br>
The hideous Ullah on its icy wings;<br>
And like a vapour from the foaming title,<br>
Rose stern Mordash, Maimoune at his side;<br>
On a light cloud her lovely limbs reclin’d,<br>
Her sable locks a starry wreath confin’d;<br>
Shame, Guilt, and Fear had darken’d every face,<br>
But her’s had yet a beam of heavenly grace;<br>
What though no more it vies with Eden’s rose,<br>
Nor in her eye angelic rapture glows,<br>
Who could behold her pensive charms, and seek<br>
A smile more brilliant, or a ruddier cheek,<br>
Could think that guilt deprest that gentle eye,<br>
Or endless torture breath’d so soft a sigh?<br>
Aw’d by her beauty, as a thing divine,<br>
From their dark thrones the Genii half incline;<br>
Then while his frame in fiendish transport shook,<br>
Alkarmel rose, and thus in thunder spoke:<br>
&emsp;“Woe to the Gospel! to the Koran joy[^3]<br>
On yonder plain ten thousand Christians lie.<br>
Joy! for this night the Queen Sybilla<sup>b</sup> dies,<br>
And fierce contentions round her bier arise.<br>
Fools! for a name, a realm yet unsubdued,<br>
Hark to their clamour! may it end in blood!<br>
May fiercer strife succeed this war of words,<br>
And Christian do the work of Moslem swords!<br>
Sing, till our Paeans reach the realms below,<br>
Joy to the Koran! to the Gospel woe!”<br>
&emsp;“Joy!” cried Demroosh, while fill’d with sudden ire,<br>
From his dark eye-balls flash’d vindictive fire.<br>
“What joy is ours? such joy as traitors feel,<br>
Nail’d to the cross, the gibbet, or the wheel;<br>
Or birds that, spell-bound by the serpent’s eye,<br>
Perceive their doom, yet lose the power to fly.<br>
Go! credulous, and shout your Prophet’s name,<br>
Till all his mosques are lost in Christian flame.<br>
In vain is Salem yours, in vain ye swore<br>
To chase the Cross from this contested shore;<br>
In vain whole hosts of vanquish’d martyrs bleed;<br>
Like waves on waves, devoted hosts succeed.<br>
Though due to British worth, yon ramparts know<br>
Their fated strength, nor fear a meaner foe,<br>
Already <span class="smallcaps">Richard</span> comes—his fleet has past<br>
The Cyprian isle, and we are foil’d at last.”<br>
&emsp;“’Tis well,” Mordash began, “for Islam’s sake,<br>
While thou art slumbering, that her guardians wake;<br>
I rais’d the storm; on Cyprus rocky coast<br>
Is <span class="smallcaps">Richard’s</span> gallant fleet dispersed or lost.<br>
Vers’d in the counsels to his father’s dear,<br>
The faithless, fatal policy of fear.<br>
That Turk and Christian hates alike, and pays,<br>
Feeds, clothes, enriches both, and both betrays,<br>
The Cyprian sceptre base Comnenus sways.<sup>c</sup><br>
The Lion King shall struggle in the toils;<br>
Not Demons match Comnenus’ race in wiles;<br>
Not all our arts have served the Faith so well,<br>
Or sent such hosts of Christian dogs to Hell.<br>
Philip may come—to-morrow’s sun may bring<br>
His vaunted fleet—we fear not Gallia’s king!<br>
To war and Ullah we his troops consign;<br>
The harder task of <span class=”smallcaps”>Richard’s</span> bane be mine;<br>
Caught in their snares whom Godfrey learn’d to curse,<br>
Their hatred deadly, but their friendship worse.”<br>
&emsp;“Nor scorn a softer spell,” Maimoune said,<br>
“His daughter’s smiles Comnenus’ craft shall aide<br>
E’en now, or all my wonted arts are vain,<br>
Evanthe strives with Love’s insidious pain;<br>
Fair as her Island’s Queen, her pensive charms<br>
Shall lure the King from Berengaria’s arms,<br>
Inglorious flowers shall wreathe his idle sword,<br>
And his stern knights deplore their recreant Lord.”<br>
&emsp;Contempt and malice Ullah’s smile exprest.<br>
“How ill thou know’st these warriors of the West!<br>
Go! spread for Asian Youth thy tempting spells,<br>
In Knighthood’s breast a loftier spirit dwells:<br>
Shrined in each bosom reigns one peerless fair,<br>
And true to her, as to the Cross they wear,<br>
Strong in their faith, through fields of death they move,<br>
For only Glory wins the smiles of Love;<br>
No second beauty lures their constant eye—<br>
Maimoune’s charms might pass unheeded by.”<br>
&emsp;“Nay!” said the Peri, “look on yonder plain,<br>
And own, my philtres are not always vain.”<br>
&emsp;“Aye, look on yonder plain! behold how near<br>
My busy fiends besiege each princely ear!”<br>
Alkarmel shouted. “Look, Demroosh! and own<br>
That Godfrey’s faith and Tancred’s zeal are flown;<br>
Those trusting zealots served their God too well,<br>
We found no vantage, and the city fell.<br>
But these are brave in vain—their hearts are ours:<br>
Ha! floats our standard not from Sion’s towers?<br>
Have we not crush’d Imperial Conrad’s host?<sup>d</sup><br>
And Gaul’s gay troop at proud Damascus crost?<br>
We bade the Earthquake towns and towers destroy<br>
We hurl’d red meteors through the flaming sky!<br>
We sear’d the grain! we dried the crystal springs!<br>
We fill’d with leprosy the courts of kings!<sup>e</sup><br>
Look on yon plain, Demroosh! thou can’st not fear<br>
Each spotted Conscience will be wash’d so clear,<br>
That not one fiend shall win his entrance there.<br>
Not <span class="smallcaps">Richard’s</span> soul is pure—on Asia’s shore,<br>
Soon shall the Christian name be heard no more,<br>
The Soldan’s dying voice shall warn in vain,<br>
And Guilt and Rapine claim their licens’d reign.”<br>
&emsp;“But,” the stern Afrit said, “what arts are ours<br>
To check the course of Frederic’s conquering powers?<br>
Young Angelus Comnenian craft has tried,<br>
But proved alone his weakness and his pride:<br>
For Frederic’s valour had too bold a spring.<br>
To brook the trifling of a powerless king;<br>
On Stamboul’s faithless towers his flag was spread,<br>
The treacherous Turks before his army fled.<br>
And proud Iconium’s Sultan found too late,<br>
Who trifles with his friendship, sports with fate.”<sup>f</sup><br>
“Fear, doubt, alarm from Frederic’s might is o’er,<br>
His army baffled, and its chief no more!”<br>
Thus spoke the fierce Moozallil, as he came,<br>
Swift as a hurricane, and wrapt inflame,<br>
“Twice warn’d, that spot shall Suabia’s Princes shun,<br>
Erst fraught with ill to Philip’s godlike son.<br>
Where Conrad droop’d, a king without a host,<br>
Now Frederic’s myriads mourn their leader lost;<br>
For as he bathed in Saleph’s frigid tide,<br>
Amid its poison’d waves he sunk and died.[^4]<br>
Was it not well? I hover’d o’er the brink<br>
His latest breath of agony to drink,<br>
His people’s cries, his son’s unceasing tears,<br>
His moans, sweet music to Moozallil’s ears!”<br>
&emsp;They shout applause; the meaner Demons round,<br>
Hovering like birds obscene, prolong the sound.<br>
Delight through either Moslem host it spread,<br>
And chill’d the Christians with spontaneous dread.<br>
&emsp;“Hail, Mighty Spirit! thou whose powerful soul,<br>
Fruitful of ill, nor ruth nor fears control!<br>
Most dire, most hateful—yet my lips decline<br>
A rival’s praises—would the deed were mine!”<br>
Alkarmel spoke, “but see, a warning dye<br>
Of feeble purple streaks the eastern sky;<br>
Hence let us haste, ere Angels purge the ground,<br>
With heavenly dews and fragrance sprinkled round,<br>
Lest here enthrall’d we pine in hated light,<br>
And yon vile Christians prosper in our sight.<br>
I go to taint the bosoms of the brave,<br>
And wake new tumults round Sybilla’s grave;<br>
Thou, Ullah! steep these fields in sudden rains,<br>
And thou, Demroosh! on all the humid plains<br>
Breathe thy hot gales, till clouds of venom rise,<br>
And famine follows, and yon army dies.<br>
Mordash with storms shall <span class="smallcaps">Richard’s</span> fleet detain,<br>
And fair Maimoune twine her flowery chain;<br>
For thee, Moozallil! who shall dare confine<br>
Such bold invention, and such power as thine?<br>
Go where thou wilt, for in thy baleful breath,<br>
Where’er thou art, are treachery, woe, and death.”<br>
&emsp;He spoke, and like the thousand sparks that fly<br>
From the sprung mine, and fade amid the sky,<br>
The Genii vanish’d, ere in golden pride<br>
The sun rose glorious from the tranquil tide.

The Christians watch’d not for the dawning light,<br>
Nor blest the day that call’d them forth to fight.<br>
Theirs the sad task their slaughtered friends to shield<br>
From ravenous birds that hover o’er the field,<br>
And wolves and shakals, that would rob the brave<br>
Of their last hope, an honourable grave.<br>
Nine mighty mounds arose, gigantic tombs,<br>
For every mound a thousand dead inhumes.<br>
While scarce distinguish’d from the general plain,<br>
One scanty pile coneeal’d the Moslem slain.<br>
&emsp;But not their labour foil’d, their bravest lost,<br>
So fills with grief and fear the anxious host,<br>
As Queen Sybilla’s death; beside her sate<br>
The widow’d Lusignan, her princely mate,<br>
Graceful in grief, his locks of waving gold<br>
Neglected o’er his regal mantle roll’d,<br>
He thought with what fond faith Amalric’s heir,<br>
Twice made herself, and once her realm, his care.<br>
Ah, from his grasp that short-lived power was fled,<br>
And she was cold, and hope itself was dead.<br>
But while he mused, with brows of thick’ning gloom<br>
Indignant Geoffrey rushes to the room.<br>
&emsp;“Weak fool! will tears recall Sybilla’s ghost,<br>
To give again the kingdom thou hast lost?<br>
Oh! that a brother I had never known,<br>
Or found in him a spirit like mine own!<br>
Yet come, nor tamely see thyself bereft,<br>
Of all of power that war and fate have left.<br>
From thy weak heart its fruitless sorrow fling,<br>
And guard, what yet thou hast, the name of King!”<br>
&emsp;The King one moment on the senseless clay<br>
Fix’d his fond gaze, then dash’d his tears away;<br>
“And must we part, ere I to earth resign<br>
These fair cold relics? yet the gift was Thine—”<br>
With folded arms and aching brows he went<br>
Where met the nobles in the regal tent,<br>
(Arm’d save their casques), and mounts the golden throne<br>
Conspicuous rais’d, and long esteem’d his own,<br>
And scarce he mark’d, that ’mid the princely crowd<br>
No chieftain rose, no head respectful bow’d;<br>
“Shame on you, Lords!” cried Geoffrey, “whence can spring<br>
This cold neglect of Sion’s hapless King?”<br>
&emsp;“And who is Sion’s King, but he who reigns<br>
In Sion’s Kingdom?” cried the bold Avesnes.[^5]<br>
“Her Lord again should Lusignan appear,<br>
Again I bend; but stand his equal here—<br>
Go! scent his hair, and wreathe his fragile blade,<br>
Not for hot fight, but courtly pageant made.<br>
Hast thou not mock’d him oft, and said that she<br>
Who made Him King, should make a God of thee?[^6]<br>
Scarce while she lived a forced respect we gave,<br>
Our freedom rises from Sybilla’s grave.<br>
Let female eyes his beauteous form admire,<br>
Our northern souls a hardier chief require.<br>
Not his an arm the Soldan’s might to bend,<br>
And win a realm he knew not to defend.”<br>
&emsp;Pride check’d the tears that fill’d the Monarch’s eye,<br>
And fiery Geoffrey struggled for reply;<br>
When Thoron thus his mild reproof addrest,<br>
Of Syria’s Counts the bravest and the best,<br>
Above ambition, pious, liberal, sage,<br>
For wisdom honour’d, though unbent by age.<br>
&emsp;“Ungenerous Chiefs! to poison thus the dart<br>
That grief has planted in a Monarch’s heart;<br>
Come ye, like vultures, darkening all the sky,<br>
Ere the first burst of hopeless grief be dry,<br>
Ere on the long-loved form the earth shall close,<br>
To tear the garland from his widow’d brows?<br>
When, at her brother’s death, her peers implored,<br>
From sad Sybilla’s choice a warrior lord,<br>
Though then, perchance, by erring fondness led,<br>
To bind the fillet on her husband’s head,<br>
If she could yield those rights by birth her own,<br>
Still Lusignan must fill the sacred throne,<br>
If not—to doubt his claim is mine alone.[^7]<br>
’Tis mine the throne with Isabelle to share,<br>
Amalric’s younger child, and now his heir.”<br>
&emsp;“Thy rights! as well might base-born kites aspire<br>
To rule the eagle!” cried the Prince of Tyre.<sup>g</sup><br>
“We leave at leisure, Lusignan and thee<br>
To settle points of legal courtesie,<br>
Thanks to your prowess! we may waive them now,<br>
Or I could tell him of a broken vow,<br>
That when a captive he his realm resign’d—[^8]<br>
But that were nought, nor oaths compell’d can bind,<br>
So say those Priests that Heaven’s high dictates scan,<br>
And chain or loose the ready faith of man.<br>
But for his Queen—Oh! could my brother know<br>
His widow’d bride would dare to stoop so low!<br>
Or when her warlike peers no more obey’d<sup>h</sup><br>
Her minion’s rule, the solemn farce she play’d!<br>
The feign’d divorce, the pledge from morn till even<br>
To seek in prayer the guiding hand of Heaven.<br>
All day she pray’d, and music’s loftiest sound,<br>
And spicy clouds, the fatal drama crown’d;<br>
Gull’d by her words, her nobles waited round<br>
As Heaven should bid to pay their ready vow;<br>
She rais’d the regal circlet from her brow<br>
And placed on Lusignan’s, but did a voice<br>
Of man or angel rise to bless the choice?<br>
They bow’d in silence, duped as all shall feel<br>
Who trust a woman with a nation’s weal.<br>
&emsp;“Doubtful of all that arms or counsel bore,<br>
And worse, his own weak powers mistrusting more,<br>
How did he reign? how many months were flown<br>
Ere Asia’s sovereign fill’d his conquer’d throne?<br>
Say! where were Lusignan? and even now,<br>
But for the arm of Conrad, where wert thou?<br>
A dungeon’s damp had chill’d this lust of power,<br>
And not one Christian breath’d on Syria’s shore.<br>
Now hear my will, and should not words avail,<br>
Beware! my sword has weight to turn the scale;<br>
Mine is the right, the power, I ask the name!<br>
And if Amalric’s child must aid my claim,<br>
Despite thine angry curse or martial pride,<br>
I make thy vaunted Isabelle my bride,<br>
Nor dread to hear the Roman thunders roar—<br>
They spare the sinner that extends their power!<br>
Or while thou liv’st, if she respect her vow<br>
To wed a <em>widow</em>, all our laws allow—<br>
And think ye, Lords! too boldly I aspire?<br>
My fleet now guards you—shall it sail for Tyre?<br>
Or—yon brave foe a warrior’s worth can feel,<br>
And more than Salem would reward my zeal.”<br>
&emsp;Bold Thoron's answering falchion quits the sheath,<br>
Frowns dark Avesnes, and Geoffrey threatens death,<br>
While by the side of Conrad, fierce and bold<br>
Like some strong tower, stood Austrian Leopold.<sup>i</sup><br>
When rose the King, and even that lawless throng<br>
In silence heard a Chief obey'd so long.<br>
“Oh! let not weapons that should stream alone<br>
With impious blood, be sullied by our own;<br>
And blame not me, if niggard Nature gave<br>
A form unwarlike, though my soul be brave.<br>
Yet ah! can those whom Hope's gay dreams beguile,<br>
Whose names are honour'd, and whose fortunes smile,<br>
Thus for the shade of vanish'd power contest,<br>
Desert their God, and crush a bleeding breast?<br>
By Him who came in meekness, He whose name<br>
Should soothe our spirits, while his wrongs inflame,<br>
Oh! cease this strife, nor be his champions found<br>
In vain contention for an empty sound!"<br>
&emsp;“What dar'st thou, dastard! call an empty name?<br>
I give it value, if I deign to claim!"<br>
&emsp;“Pause!" cried a voice that every bosom froze,<br>
And ’mid the hail a ghastly man uprose.<br>
The grave's white vestments form'd his wild attire,<br>
His glazed eyes glimmer'd with unearthly fire;<br>
On high his lean and wither'd arms he spread;<br>
Is that the hand that Moslem hosts have fled?<br>
They doubt if those sepulchral accents came<br>
From Raymond's spectre, or his living frame,<br>
“Stop, impious and insensate!— Lo! I come<br>
Ev'n from the very borders of the tomb,<br>
Once more your guilty fury to restrain,<br>
Once more to warn you, and to warn in vain.<br>
Cowards! to taunt the fallen with his shame!<br>
And who that hears me has the right to blame?<br>
Not you, his subjects, rebels to his power,<br>
And false to Sion in her dangerous hour;<br>
Not you, ye Templars, who the strife renew'd,<br>
Your robes polluting with a Herald's blood;<sup>k</sup><br>
Not Eudon, scorning my prophetic word,<br>
Who forced a fatal counsel on his Lord.<br>
’Twas then the Soldan girt Tabaria's wall—<br>
But I was deaf to wife and offspring's call;<br>
I wept for Sion, I besought him yield<br>
Their fate to Heaven, and be his Sion's shield—<br>
In vain! he flew to guard the leaguer'd town,<br>
He could not save it: and he lost his crown.<br>
This was his crime! and that my honest zeal<br>
To all I loved preferr'd the public weal,<br>
That when my voice was scorn'd, destruction came,<br>
Ye call me traitor! I retort the name.<br>
Is this the meed for acts so great and bold<br>
As should have lived in everlasting gold?<br>
This warp'd my brain, this foul reproach has riven<br>
The bonds of life, this pains my sires in Heaven.<sup>l</sup><br>
Woe, woe for Sion! for her hearths profaned,<br>
Her murder'd children, and her temples stain'd;<br>
Oh recreants! traitors to the Cross ye bear!<br>
Whom fury, avarice, lust, alternate share,<br>
Still must your half-heal'd feuds again begin,<br>
And scorn and rancour blast the wreaths ye win.<br>
Know ye, whose madness all the good deplore.<br>
Know! heaven respects that great Barbarian more,<br>
Whose soul untaught in virtue yours exceeds,<br>
Than ye, apostates not in name, but deeds,"<br>
&emsp;He spoke; his eyes a ghastlier lustre fired,<br>
It flash'd like lightning, and like that expired;<br>
Through all his frame a strong convulsion past,<br>
One startling shriek he gave, it was the last;<br>
With that his mighty spirit burst away,<br>
And cold and rigid fell the lifeless clay.<br>
&emsp;Awe, shame, and sense of past ingratitude,<br>
Chain'd every tongue, and every heart subdued;<br>
But Conrad frown'd; "Are we, that even now<br>
Raged like the winds on Thabor's stormy brow,<br>
Hush'd to such stillness that we hear the call<br>
Of the changed guard on Acre's distant wall—<br>
Heroes! so prompt to scorn the Soldan's sword,<br>
Yet cow'd and trembling at a maniac's word,<br>
Hence I conjure! in peaceful halls recline,<br>
Leave me to martyrdom, or Palestine.<br>
I need not dread to bear the war alone,<br>
Or lose one soldier, when ye all are gone."<br>
&emsp;But moved by heaven to curb his fiery mood,<br>
Rose Sarum's pious Prelate, great and good;<br>
Though he had laid his saintly garb aside<br>
For the dark hauberk and the helmet's pride,<br>
He deem'd it duty; nor that warrior-age<br>
Disdain'd to blend the soldier and the sage,<br>
But lauded Hubert's martial pilgrimage.<sup>m</sup><br>
&emsp;“Ye Franks and Syrians, Knights and Princes,<br>
Hear for his sake whose sacred badge ye wear;<br>
Has the keen sabre swept whole ranks away,<br>
Has Death permitted, struck a royal prey,<br>
Even in your sight his last dread warning dealt,<br>
And is the awful lesson yet unfelt?<br>
Perjur'd, if here your swords ambition draws,<br>
Traitors, if arm'd to fight a Saviour's cause,<br>
Alike this senseless strife some Demon fires,<br>
And your rash folly mocks your own desires.<br>
Oh Conrad! I would see thee falter now,<br>
There is no manhood in that scornful brow;<br>
Long shall these realms a female reign deplore,<br>
But let not Sion mourn thy valour more—<br>
Flush'd with the conquest of the sacred town,<br>
Heroic Godfrey shunn'd her proffer'd crown,<br>
Nor where his Saviour felt the torturing thorn,<br>
Would he with gold his humble brows adorn.[^9]<br>
Art thou more pure that thou thy head canst rear,<br>
And bid the God of Empires fix it there?<br>
Oh! think on Antioch—vain was valour's sword<br>
Till contrite hearts appeas'd the offended Lord.<sup>n</sup><br>
Even now two powerful Sovereigns stem the tide,<br>
Let Philip, let Plantagenet decide;<br>
Meanwhile let sabres clash, and lances shine,<br>
Rush all to war, but war with Saladine.<br>
He deems us baffled, by defeat deprest,<br>
Haste! let our trumpets break his scornful rest;<br>
If all unite, we yet may brave his host,<br>
And Heaven again restore our glory lost.”<br>
He spoke, and stubborn age and fiery youth<br>
Smooth'd the bent brow, and own'd the voice of truth.<br>
Again in peace the jarring chiefs unite,<br>
And marshal all their various bands for fight.

Yet not for this the Demon's art was foil'd, Not yet Alkarmel's venom'd shaft recoil'd. With wounded pride consumed, and smother'd ire, He marked fierce Conrad and his friend retire, And while his arts a deeper gulf prepare, Exults to see them rushing to the snare. In Conrad's tent in suppliant guise was seen, A graceful woman with majestic mien j Veil'd were her features, but his Tyrian band, 470 Respectful own'd her accent of command; (( Conrad!" she said—the wondering chieftain turn'd, And on his cheek indignant crimson burn'd; For in that age when heroes loved to own Their deadliest peril in their lady's frown, Her smile the dearest guerdon of the brave, His was the boast to live no woman's slave. " Conrad, attend! I brook no careless ear, What I shall say, thou well may'st deign to hear."
Even as she spoke her veil embroider'd fell, 480 He knew the wife of Thoron, Isabelle. Yet while a sister's corse her tears should claim, While life's last warmth yet lingers in her frame, What means that purple robe, that regal air, That diamond wreath that binds her sable hair? But Conrad silent stands, amaz'd to trace The calm, proud grandeur of that lovely face, Amazed to feel a woman's words control, A woman's glances awe his fiery soul. ťt Lend, on thy vassal faith, a duteous ear; 490 Tis Salem's Queen that stands a suppliant here. What means that frown? be proud that I require A warrior's aid, and choose the Prince of Tyre. I know thy daring hopes, thy bold design, Obey me, and those daring hopes are thine; But pause, and I with Lusignan unite, And who but arms to guard a female right! Thou know'st my claims; howe'er thy fiery mood May feign to scorn the sacred rights of blood, Thou know'st Judea's crown is mine alone, 500 A ravish' d crown! a kingdom to be won! Oh! how my soul is panting to unite A conqueror's glory with a sovereign's right;
But Thoron's timid breast can never glow With those high thoughts that nobler natures know. Fate to his form a kindred spirit gave, And did but mock him, when she made him brave.* My eager hopes with listless mind he hears, And melts at Lusignan's unmanly tears. Think not I come in passion; unprepared; 510 He shall not keep the rights he will not guard. In youth's first dawn, ere reason learned to guide, My mother gave me, an unwilling bride; " Edessa's Priest shall free me from my vows. So thou my interests and myself espouse, Together we our claims, our arms combine, I give the right, the martial fame be thine." Amaz'd he listen'd; humbled, gratified, While joy with anger strove, and shame with pride. Yet his proud knee has prest the wondering sand, He kiss'd with deep respect the proffer'd hand. Own'd it his dearest glory to obey, And vow'd allegiance where he meant to sway.
Then as the Queen retired, and louder round The war-cries thicken, and the trumpets sound. O'er his dark brow his sable helm he drew, Mounts his stout charger, and to combat flew. Already, eager for the conflict, shine On Acre's plain the troops of Saladine, Already on her towers th' intrepid foe 530 Whirl the long sling, and bend the stubborn bow; Between, with massy walls and trenches bound, The Christian camp the heights of Turon crown'd. The gates unfold, and forth the warriors pour, From Belus' banks to Ocean's sloping shore; First, on the right, amid a chosen throng Of knightly guards, the Standard mov'd along; Six snowy steers, that sable housings bear Since Sion's capture, drew the milk-white car, Where on a turret, from a Cross of gold, 540 The spotless banner of her faith unroll'd; Beneath, and veil'd in silk from eyes profane, Four reverend priests the Book of Life sustain. Near it rode Lusignan (whose vest display'd The hue of grief), and Gallia's troop array'd
With those brave knights, not more for arms renown'd Than tender skill to heal the burning wound.* On Ocean's verge the Prince of Tyre commands His own, the Lombard and Venetian bands; The wealthy Pisans, and Thuringians bold 550 Move in the centre, led by Leopold. Apart, to watch the battle's doubtful fate, With Gueldres' Duke the white-rob'd Templars wait, While Geoffrey, to protect the camp, retains The Count of Flanders, and the stout Avesnes. Cold was each Christian's heart, as he beheld His comrade's sepulchres o'ersbade the field; But when on high that sacred Standard rose, Through all their veins a brisker current flows, New hopes, new strength, inspire the pious throng, " 'Tis Heaven's high Will," they shout, and rush along,t And Conrad cries, exulting in his powers, (( Stand neuter, Heaven, and Victory is ours V'ţ
In close array from Belus' banks advance The men-at-arms, and archery of France, Where Omar's voice the Soldan's left commands An arrowy tempest thins the Moslem bands; That ardent Chieftain whom the fiends inflame With deadliest hatred of the Christian name, Who in Tabaria's field its guards subdued 570 And dragg'd through dust and gore the "HolyRood." Skill'd in the wiles of war, a moment eyed The field of blood and ' ( Fly, my Friends!",he cried, " By feign'd disorder rash pursuit invite,, But wait the foe on Kaisan 's rocky height. And thou, brave Selim, bid the Soldan know, 1 but retreat to strike a heavier blow; Let all his warriors, marshall'd on the plain, Close on the Franks, and drive them to the main, While in yon dells again I raise the spear, 580 And on th' assailants turn the storm of war."* The warriors heard, and at their Chief's command, A well feign'd terror spread through all the band; To Kaisan's ridge with broken ranks they flew, And wild in thoughtless haste the Franks pursue.,* Histoire de Saladin.
Already Selim in the Soldan's ear Begins his tale, but Lusignan was near; His whizzing javelin pierc'd the Arab's side, And on his lips th' important tidings died. Meanwhile the Soldan, by his death betray'd, 590 Sends his best forces to his Nephew's aid, But Omar's flying squadrons spread despair, And the feign'd panic grew to real there. Like frighted deer on every side they fly— While thundering comes the Christian Cavalry; Without a blow the trembling caitiffs yield And thousands dead or dying strew the field. Now to the Moslem Camp the Christians sped, Assail'd the ramparts, heap'd the fosse with dead. In vain the gates, in vain the guards oppose, 600 Their feeble force against the conquering foes, They through the camp with madding fury flew, Trod down the Crescent, and the tents o'erthrew, The wealth disclosed rapacious thoughts inspires, That quench the warrior's rage, the zealot's fires. Now near a Bedouin's tent they seiz'd a steed Of far descended fame, and matchless speed, A fatal prize!—Now dainties lure the eye, Fezzan's rich date-bread, fruits of Araby, vol. i. t>
And marble vases fill'd with iced sherbet, 610 The temperate banquet for the Soldan set. Elate they bid the cooling beverage flow, And while they drain the bowl, the fight forego. Inebriate all, such idle pranks they play'd, As prov'd the snare by fell Alkarmel laid. Some their rude limbs in Persian robes enfold, One seiz'd a turban stiff with gems and gold, Round his brown helmet winds the starry coil, Mounts the divan and portions out the spoil. On Mahumeria's height the Count of Bar, 620 From Saladine's pavilion views the war, Mounts the Muezzin's consecrated tower, And calls with scoffing dissonance the hour; His laughing troops beneath the frenzy share, In mock ablutions mix'd, and mimic prayer.* Meanwhile the Soldan speeds o'er all the plain. Entreats, commands, exhorts, and threats in vain. Five dauntless Mamlukes, in his palace bred, Alone remain to guard his sacred head; As Eudon and his Red-Cross knights advance, 630 For him they spread the shield, and point the lance,
And, careless of their lives, protect alone Their generous Lord, too careless of his own. But forth Moheddin flew, his powerful blade By Selim's corse the pious Azo laid, (Pleas'd in his Saviour's cause to yield his breath, And fill'd with holy hope he smiles in death,) Then as he saw Seiffeddin speeding by, ft And can," he cried, " the King of Mosul fly? Can souls like thine inglorious safety prize, 640 And flee from peril, while the Soldan dies?" He spoke, the proud Seiffeddin waved his hand, But swifter sped to call his scatter'd band. " But hark! yon drum; to end th' unfmish'd fight, Another army stands on Kaisan's height. Be Allah prais'd! 'tis Islam's flag of gloom, 'Tis Mosul's youth, 'tis Omar's yellow plume!" The keen-eyed Soldan spoke, new hope succeeds, Behind a hill his little troop he leads; Again resounds the royal Atabal, 650 And routed Islam rallies at the call. His four fair dwarfs, insensible of fear, Who bore the Korau through the ranks of war, Haste to their pious Lord and round him raise The calm but joyful chaunt of prayer and praise. u 2
Scarce seemed these elfin forms the sons of earth; Born in one hour, one mother gave them birth. Their little limbs in just proportion shew, Graceful their walk, their voices sweet and low j Untouch'd by sorrow, as unknown to guile, 660 Nor anger rais'd a frown, nor mirth a smile, Nor in their hearts had love or hate a share, Each thought was heaven's, their whole existence prayer. Though they unmoved through fields of slaughter ride, To swell their veins no living creature died, Nor while the Sun dispens'd his golden light Think they of food, but when he sets in night The Camel's milk, or heaven's ambrosial dew, Or Asia's nectar'd fruits, their strength renew. In yellow robes, as slaves of Saladine, 670 These infant forms on downy cushions shine. Four sable mules their fairy hands obey; Between, on yellow silk the Koran lay In sable folds (the hue of Islam), bound p With studs of pearl, and clasp'd with silver round. Unharm'd they stem the battle's fiercest tide Λ And Moslems deem that angels guard and guide; > Perchance 'fwas pity turn'd the sword aside, j
Or He whose mercies human thought exceed, Approves their blameless lives, forgives their erring creed. 680 Thus while the Chief his faithful band array'd, And hush'd the drum, and form'd his ambuscade, Sage Karacous from Acre's lofty walls Observes the battle, and on Mestoc calls; 4 His colleague hears, a chosen troop they wait, Then burst, a torrent, from the Patriarch's gate. At that dire moment—'twas some Demon's deed— The cord was cut that held the Bedouin steed, Snorting he bounds away, his guards pursue,* Their comrades deem it flight and follow too— 690 But soon recoil, for where they late subdued The hostile host, the strength of Acre stood. Confusion reigns; encumber'd with the weight Of useless spoil, they ill may fly or fight,,d 3
One casts aside the load that checks his speed, Another seizes, but alike they bleed, This by the sabre, that the swift Jcrreed. Not, tempest-tost, the Mariner descries The distant port with such desiring eyes, As they their camp, whose walls, whose massy towers, Like some strong town, might mock th' assaulting powers · There is the press, there battle's clamorous cry, There groan the wounded, there the mighty die. Before the gate th' intrepid Templars stood, Their snowy surcoats dyed with impious blood, For Omar comes again—Great Eudon calls To close the valves, but as he speaks he falls; Of all his warriors first in worth and name, Till one rash deed obscured his splendid fame. The Templars tremble— Omar rushes on, 700 Bounds o'er the corse, and shouts, " the Camp is won." Brave Andrea saw the dreadful conqueror near And hurťd at Omar's heart his powerful spear, But Omar tore it guiltless from his vest, And plunged its mortal point in Andrea's breast:
" Oh save me, Erard!" was his dying cry; Unheeding Erard pass'd his brother by; r And great Avesnes, in his impetuous course Borne down, encumber'd by his slaughter'd horse, Had died, but swifter than a beam of light 7№ He sits, remounted by the Emerald Knight. The Emerald Knight?—alike to all unknown, Seldom his voice was heard, his features shewn.* First in the van his milk-white Jennet flew; Last from the breach his lingering steps withdrew. Plain was his shield, but Islam's fears confest His warlike worth, and rescued Tyre had blest, What time with Conrad from her batter'd towers, In shameful flight he drove the Soldan's powers; Yet when his casque was rais'd, his pensive look 720 Of sorrow more than martial fury spoke.,d 4
And once a wanderer in the moonlight grove Heard a soft voice that plain'd of slighted love, And saw surpris'd, a Knight in armour green, With streaming eyes and silver mandoline. Who breath'd his sorrows in so sweet a strain, All nature seem'd to share his amorous pain; But now his mind far other thoughts engage, Fierce as the famish'd tyger's direst rage, He rush'd to check the Arab Chief's career, 730 And through his other arm impell'd the spear. Where still the Templars, prodigal of life, With hearts unshrinking bear th' unequal strife, The grey-hair'd Gerard dies; but while the foe Bent o'er the slain, repeats the murderous blow, Smote by that Knight Unknown, the Turk expires, And Omar bleeding, from his sword retires. But not since first arose the shout of death Had Austria's Duke or Conrad paus'd for breath. Brothers in arms as by their race allied, 740 On sable steeds they combat side by side; First in pursuit o'er dying crowds they flew, Nor now retired when Fortune's smiles withdrew, Brave as twin Lions, still they smite, they slay On every side, and half redeem the day.
But Tyre's proud Prince by high ambition wrought To prove him worthy of the crown he sought, And mad to lose a battle gain'd, exceeds His kinsman's* fame, his own exalted deeds. Where numbers bled by Omar's biting sword, 750 He hastes to succour Altaripa's Lord, f Where late the Knight Unknown infix'd the wound, Tight o'er his arm his scarf the Arab bound, And close he prest his priestly foe, the smart Firing to keener rage his savage heart. But Conrad's lance his better shoulder tore, And death had follow'd with the spouting gore Save that some fiend forbade; his shield he threw O'er the torn limb, and glaring rage, withdrew. Next from where Nilus' ample waters pour 7β0 O'er craggy cliffs, and deafen with their roar, Came the black Melkos; wide his shoulders spread, A crimson shawl thick wrapp'd his giant head.ţ
By his huge club fair Castelluno's pride Guido the bold and gentle Lovel died;* Pierc'd through his Panther's hide, the mightier hand Of Conrad stretch'd the Ethiop on the sand. Next Ismail bled; belov'd by Asia's Lord, Who own'd a kinsman in the noble Kurd/ Where mountain streams the rapid Tigris fed, /70 Sprung from one tribe, and in one valley bred, The morn of life in rival sports they led; And, side by side, had since in battle fray For glory labour'd many a dreadful day. Long in the strife he Conrad's rage withstood, But sunk at last his victim, drench'd in blood: Not all his own; the Prince was taught to feel Through his stout mail, brave Ismail's trenchant steel. Infuriate Conrad lopp'd his head, and sought Wnere near the ocean strand the Soldan fought, 780 Yet, not unmindful of a leader's сягс, With prompt, decisive wisdom, rul'd the war. " Behold thy Friend!" the savage victor said, Then at bis feet he cast the gory head.
The Soldan knew the long-lov'd face, the dart Uprais'd to pierce the young Anselmo's heart,* DoWn dropp'd—a deathlike darkness o'er him came, Moheddin's arm supports his tottering frame. On press'dthe Prince, (i Let Asia Weep," he calls, " By Conrad's arm her vaunted Ruler falls;" 790 But Asia lov'd her Lord—an arrow flies, Pierced in the spine his German War-horse dies, And Hassan, while he struggled on the ground, In Conrad's side inflicts another wound; Where now that boastful spirit that denied The help of Heaven, and on itself relied? Not wholly fled—be rais'd him from the plain And as the Chief revived, impell'd by pain Forward he sprung: " Defend thee, Saladine! ¿ If fate resume a gift so nearly mine, 800a I scorn to die by meaner hands than thine." s Moheddin's massy shield received the stroke, The shield was shiver'd, but the falchion broke. What now can save him? weaponless he stands Alone and wounded 'mid th' infuriate bands; But Lusignan his rival's danger saw' And rancour fled at Nature's mightier law;
He call'd for aid, th' illustrious Glanville came," Hoary with years, yet still of vigorous frame, He plies his dreadful mace that ne'er in vain 810 Smote the crush'd foe, nor needs to smite again. Awhile the troops recoil—the King with speed Uplifts the fainting Conrad on his steed, Then through the fighting throng retreating slow Wards with his buckler every hostile blow. Not so the Norman, lie whose youth had led A Scottish King in chains, whose manhood sway'd The sword of Justice, and who first bestow'd On England's Isle her law's collected Code, Who mourning o'er his royal patron's loss 820 Would serve no second King, and took the Cross, By stern Moheddin's vengeful javelin dies, And low in dust the noble veteran lies. Nor had the King the Camp in safety gain'd, But Geoffrey, who with Flander's Earl sustain'd Lulo, w and Karacous, and Mestoc's might, Flies to his aid, and guards him through the fight. Thus mix'd in conflict, neither host descried The Christian vessels darkening all the tide;
The heaven descended Oriflamme unfold 830 Its crimson banner from the lance of gold. Yet now has France, amid the yielding sand Driven her firm prows, and Philip springs to land. Far off he sees the tumult of the field, The Moslems conquer, the Crusaders yield; And like a steed that knows the trumpets sound, Scarce stays to call his brave Ribaldi round;* (That valiant band, then great in worth and fame, Though base opprobrium now defile the name.) He heads their charge; on Sion's impious foes 840 His lance, his sword, avenge their long repose. The bands of Karacous, dispersed, o'erthrown, Fly to the hills, or seek the sheltering town. And where with Gueldrcs' Duke the Temjilars fought Like powerful succour Montmorency brought;| The Soldan, still in danger undismayed Cheer'd his brave army, and again arrayed,
But when stout Joinville, Courcy and Champagne, Drogo and Alberic heap'd the field with slain,* When Otho flush'd with hope and glory pours 850 His brave Burgundians from the neighbouring shores, He flies—while reckless now of scar or wound, New hope, new strength the routed Christians found; Again they rush'd impetuous where afar Their Standard floated from its lofty Car, And loyal in th' unhoped advantage won, Call on their slighted King to lead them on. He heeds them not, for 'mid a crowd of slain He mark'd a waving hand and heard the groan of pain. The Templars' Chief, the noble Eudon there 800 Ebb'd out his life, yet ere he rose to share A martyr's crown, his fleeting soul implored For conscious crime forgiveness from his Lord. " О Lusignan! most injur'd, yet most kind, I dare to call, I know thy generous mind. Forgive me that by interest sway'd, and pride, The Mountain Herald by my dagger died; Forgive what follow'd from that guilty day — Of deeds disloyal to so mild a sway.
I go where all our earthly passions cease, 870 And my repentant soul would part in peace." " Oh! Eudon, that my prayers could life recall," He said, ťt as freely as I pardon all. Yet, Eudon, thou mayst joy in strength renew'd—· Trust nte, my skill can stanch the welling blood." The Templar faintly smiled—his panting breath Grew thick and heavy with approaching death, And his weak frame, half rais'd upon his hand, Fell back a lifeless burthen on the sand.
“Alas!" the monarch murmur'd, " day by day, Our best, our bravest, wisest, melt away. What crowds since morn have found their earthly goal, And thine is fled to Raymond's kindred soul! In vain these zealous Gauls your place supply, Too soon by famine, war, disease, to die; Oh! when again shall Heaven's full favour shine On its once loved, now wretched Palestine? " He felt a friendly grasp—beside him stood \ Hubert, his blade in Moslem gore embrued, > And even his silver plumage wet with blood. 8QQj But as he turn'd, the smiles of peace assuage On the mild prelate's brow the warrior's rage.
" Nay, blush not, Prince! thrice honour'd every tear That falls from thee on noble Eudon's bier; Nor is the life by thee to Conrad given, On Earth unhonour'd, or unblest in Heaven. Yet turn and see what countless galiots sweep With crowded sails triumphant o'er the deep; Nor Raymond warn'd, nor Eudon fell in vain, But their glad spirits smile on Acre's plain." 900 He look'd, and saw the foe in rapid flight, Stay'd only on Kharouba's distant height, While, their red crosses glittering in the sun, The eager Franks pursue th' advantage won; He look'd again, where Ocean blacken'd o'er, Still floats unnumber'd vessels to the shore, From each stout galley springs its armed freight, And the glad seas feel lighten'd of their weight/ ic Behold the power of Faith!" the Prelate cried; " No more by famine and by fraud destroy'd, 910 Wcuken'd by toil, with frames, with hopes decay'd, From Europe comes an inefficient aid. Faith leads our warriors on, she stems the seas, Defies the current, and controls the breeze, The Soldan's courage quails before her power, And trembling Acre dreads her funeral hour."
Then laying as he spoke his helm aside, With lifted Cross and saintly smile he hied O'er all the field, the doubting soul to save, To dew with tears the contrite sinner's grave, 920 And while, St. John! thy pious brethren bind The gaping wound, he heals the tortur'd mind, Holds mercy's pledge before the closing eye, And bids the parting soul ascend to joy.,

CŒUR DE LION.,BOOK IL,THE CONQUEST OF CYPRUS. Вит England's King becalm'd on treacherous seas, Remote from Acre, mourns the failing breeze; His martial band, to toil and strife inured, 111 the dull languor of repose endured, And envied Frederic's host, though fraud and force And famine, mark'd its long laborious course. Day after day, upon the glassy main Rose the broad sun, and crost, and sunk again; Night after night, the moon unclouded shone On waves detested, under stars unknown. 10 в 3
Oh! forsorne rock, some island's distant form; Oh! for the change, th' excitement of the storm. It comes!—the storm—clouds darken all the heaven, The raging billows roar—the sails are riven j From every point the winds contending meet, Disperse, destroy, or whelm the struggling fleet. Alone the regal bark with steady prow, In crimson splendour scorns the waves below; Proud of her freight, she bends not to the blast, And her red flag flows freely from the mast. SO That power divine which guards the life of Kings, Spreads o'er the vessel its protecting wings. Fix'd on the beak, the monarch's anxious mind Watch'd a light Galliot, tost by waves and wind, With streamers gay, as formed alone to bear On summer lakes the courtly and tie fair. Frail as it is, its painted sides contain The best and fairest of his princely train, Matilda, less in blood than love allied, And Berengaria, his affianced bride." 30 He hears their cries amid the tempest's roar, He sees them kneeling, him and Heaven implore; But as he gazed, to shroud them from his eyes, The sky sinks down, the foaming waters rise;
On boiling waves a giant phantom stands, Spread o'er the heaven, the lightning arms his hands; His head is veiled in darkness, but his form Reveals the Demon that excites the storm. Where'er he moves, oars, rudders, sails are lost, And helpless barks in circling eddies tost; 40 He strikes a mast—it falls—one dreadful cry Bursts from the Ship, one shriek of agony; In rush the roaring waves, the breakers sweep O'er the low helm, and bear it to the deep. Again his lightnings fly j sublimely dire The fated Galley shines, a sheet of fire; Now here, now there, by foaming surges cast, Its blazing fragments scattered on the blast, The dark heavens blush above, the sea below, And terror sits upon the flaming prow. 50 So late robust with winds and waves to fight, But now a spectre-ship of paly light, Sudden its golden hue grows dull and dark, And hissing ocean closea o'er the bark. Awe struck, each rower drops the useless oar, Looks on the tempest, and contends no more: But Richard raises to the sunless sky His calm sad gaze: " Oh î Thou that rul'st on high! в 4
" Just are thy judgments, yet if Thou disdain This arm unworthy, spare my guiltless train!" 60 To whelm the regal bark, dilating wide, Now moves the Demon o'er the troubled tide, But Heaven forbids—commission' d from on high The bolt of vengeance cleaves the flaming sky, It strikes the phantom form, loud thunders sound, He flies in mist and pours a deluge round. Then soon the storm is hush'd, and broad and bright, The level suo beams forth his parting light: But where the bridal ship? the King in vain Strains his keen sight, it floats not on the main; 70 And where his princely galleys? far away, Dispers' d or lost is half that proud array; The rest with shatter'd masts and canvas torn, Are but the wrecks of those he rul'd at morn— O'erspent with toil, when danger threats no more, Soon each tired rower slumbers on his oar; But what benignant spirit charms to rest The griefs contending in the royal breast? He bleeps! serenely sleeps!—and not a trace Of deeper care than on an infant's face. 80 Nor of that ship he dreams, nor of the storm, Nor Berengaria, nor Matilda's form,
But one that seem'd more fair; a nymph unknown, Whose azure eyes in softest lustre shone. Her cross of virgin gold, her purple vest, Her christian faith and royal birth attest: And now the restless deep is spread with flowers, The amorous birds sing sweet in myrtle bowers ·, While airy hands the rich pavilion drest, And dancing youths bring -n the gorgeous feast j 90 While tapers flame and incense breathes around, And silver citterns yield a sprightly sound; On seats of painted velvet they recline, And quaff from glittering bowls the amber wine. And now she sings, and never waking ear Such strains of melting harmony shall hear, In ever varying bliss the moments fly, And his delighted spirit swims in joy. Startled he wakes—and is the vision true? The clear waves shine with morning's saffron hue, 100 And all around him, like an emerald zone, Stretch'd the fair harbour of some isle unknown. The blossom'd shrubs, regardless of the breeze, Hang their rich clusters o'er the rippling seas, While 'mid the classic plane's sublimer shade Shines the proud temple, and the long arcade,
The vast rotunda of imperial Rome And Islam's minaret and pigmy dome. Eternal summer seems to linger there, The vivid flowers attest the balmy air, 110 And every gale voluptuous fragrance pours, Soft odours, strangers to our northern shores. The wanderet long by winds and currents driven, Finds earth a garden, every port a heaven; Can hail Muscovia's rocks and gelid gloom, Though stripes and slavery be the stranger's doom: b Then in this eager host what raptures rise As morn unfolds an earthly Paradise. ' f Prais'd be the Virgin! or what gracious power Hath been our pilot to so fair a shore. 120 Yet," cries the King, ťC by these delicious gales, 'Tis Cyprus woos us to her smiling vales. My Lord of Pembroke, be it thine to beur Our royal greetings to Comnenus' heir; We come as friends, to free the sacred shrine, But find his waves are leagued with Saladine! Say that we crave, by their rude fury crost, Aid for our barks, refreshment for our host, Yet wait his princely sanction ere we pour An armed nation on a foreign shore." ISO
The day wears ou; while anchor'd by the port, He waits his herald from th* imperial Court, Six noble galleys, from the storm secure, Hail the red flag, and near their sovereign moor. The night descends—again the morning shines, But brings no envoy, and the host repines, Condemn'd, like fabled Tantalus, to bear Tha sight of pleasures which it cannot share. Nor more the King approves his herald's stay, " And whence," he said, " this long, this strange delay? 140 Methinks Byzantium's exiled Lords retain 0 Their fathers' pride, though not their fathers' reign. Our bhatter'd state demands a speedier aid, Nor thanks thnt love which lingers for parade." c * Perchance, my liege," a youthful Noble cried, " Far from the shore the Cypriot Chiefs reside."— " Perchance, Earl Leicester! but my father's coast Was still a haven to the tempest tost; d 111 rules the Sovereign, where a servile train Dares wait his royal leave to be humane. 150 Our Irish Kernes, Barbarians though they be, Might teach these polish'd Grecians courtesie.
Wc stay till morn—if no respect they shew, The King who came a friend may land a foe." He ceas'd, and silent sate from all apart, With darken'd brow and agonizing heart j Now seem'd to count the waves, or on the sky Impatient glanced, but still the sun was high. Of his lost friends he thought, or those more dear Whelm'd in the waves, or rack'd with equal fear;160 Yet ever and anon, a vision fair, A Syren's voice seem'd floating on the air, And mix'd unbidden with the mournful theme, The lovely form that lured him in his dream. Now bath'd in crimson earth and ocean glows, Now coldly fair the silver moon arose; Bright fell her beams on Amathusa's shore, Where round the cliffs eternal breakers roar. A fitful light appears—one warrior braves That stormy cape, and dares contending waves. I70 Now hid by rocks, now tost by angry tides, Near and more near his little skiff he guides, Till o'er the royal deck his arms he flings, And to his Monarch's feet exulting springs.
" My gallant Albert! but thy news declare, Swift! for thy smiling* front bespeaks them fair." " Blest be that Saint, my gracious Liege, that gave Thy bark to dance so gaily o'er the wave, When others founder'd—doubly blest the care Which now has sav'd thee from a deadlier snare." 180 " Amen! Lord Albert; but what snares are here? From Christian Prince can Christian Pilgrim fear?" tc A Christian Prince! Oh no! my generous Lord, By Isaac's soul is Asia's God ador'd j With Saladine eternal faith he swore, They lanced their veins, and drank the mingled gorc. c But I have happier tidings—proud to bear Kind greetings from thy Lady of Navarre, And England's Princess—moor'd in safety near, For thee alone they pray, alone they fear." 190 " Ye bounteous heavens! then am I doubly blest, But these are riddles—speak, explain the rest." "Torn from our friends, the storm," said Albert, " bore My bark and Harcourťs to this hateful shore, Wreck'd on the rocks, with many a treacherous smile, The artful natives hail'd us to the isle; On to the fort our dripping troop they led, As guests we cnter'd, but as captives staid.
Foodless, and chain'd within a dungeon's gloom, Alone I pin'd, and curst my lingering doom; 200 At length a slave appear'd—his scarf he wound Tight o'er my eyes, and next my limbs unbound. He led me forth—a length of cavern shed Chill damps around, and echo'd to our tread, Till breath'd the gajes of heaven, serenely sweet, And the cool herbage rustled round my feet. He loos'd the bandage—under citron bowers Refreshing fountains fell in lucid showers; Alone, and shelter'd by a rich arcade Stood, like the Paphian Queen, a Grecian maid. 210 A gold tiara wreath'd her tresses round, A golden zone her purple tunic bound, Nor e'er the Goddess wore so sweet a smile, Nor seem'd her tender dove so void of guile. " Approach" she said, " no foes are ambush'd here, Thy faith, thy country, to my heart are dear, And every morn before the Virgin's shrine, I pray for those that fight in Palestine. Alas! while yet I speak, thine eyes upbraid; f But how may I, a weak and erring maid, 220 Unvers'd in state or policy, presume To blame those laws that fix the stranger's doom!
Yet ah! if Kings must chase each kindlier thought By Heaven self-planted, or Religion taught, Oh! may this frame the breath of life resign, Untimely withering, ere the crown be mine. Stranger! if erring pride my soul mislead, Oh pray with me that Heaven absolve the deed; To save the helpless from a fatal snare, To save my sire from guilt, his wrath I dare. 230 Two royal dames are anchor'd nigh, and one To whose lost spouse that parent ow'd his throne,* But if they touch this inauspicious shore Or life or freedom may be theirs no more. 5 So speak my fears—but haste, the task is mine To fill this vase with Commanderian wine, That wine unmatch'd beneath the bright abodes, Which Pagan Bards might challenge for their Gods. With proffers fair are fraudful envoys sent, They perish if no friendly voice prevent; 240 To me their speech is strange, write thou the scroll, And with a sacred warning wreathe the bowl."
ï wrote, o'erwhelm'd with new excited fear, " Fly, royal dames! for danger waits you here." Then as the graceful Princess waved farewell, And call'd the slave to lead me to my cell, iC Have I but breathed these gales of bairn," I said, To quit Elysium for the Stygian shade?" " Alas!" she answer'd with a pitying sigh, ťe Powerless to grant, with anguish I deny." 250 Yet had her words the path of freedom shewn— \ Blindfold again, my gaoler led me on; > I watch'd the time, when all seem'd still and lone, J To burst my bonds, and rushing on the slave Disarm'd and bound hirn, but his life forgave; I bribed his silence (powerful gold had moved A Grecian's faith, had Isaac been beloved), Then hid my sable mail and knightly crest In his high cap and loose embroider'd vest. 'Twas on yon peak, where once a splendid pile 260 Rose to the Goddess of this favour'd isle: Some columns yet a broken frieze sustain Sad with the tale of Cythcrea's pain; The Phrygian hunter, and the fatal boar. And that pale flower now purple with hi» gore.
No longer hid in clouds of spicy gloom, And cypress boughs, and wreaths of roseate bloom, The rest in beauteous ruin strew the ground, Chok'd with rank weeds, or clasp'd with ivy round: There too the myrtle, faithful to her Queen, 270 Veils her fallen statue with perennial green. A mournful theme, but mine were raptures then; On either side I viewed the boundless main; Oh! with what joy thy crimson sails were seen, But ah! too distant, and the town between. Nearer, and anchor'd in the Paphian bay, West of the Cape, thy lovely Consort lay.* I ran, I mingled with th' Imperial band, ^ I mount the ready bark that leaves the land, > And near my Queen, unmark'd, unknown, I stand. J A slave was there, from crafty Isaac sent With tempting fruits and courtly compliment. A golden vase of ample size he bore, Much for the metal prized, the sculpture more:
It shew'd, contending in th' Idæan grove, The bhie-eye'd Pallas, and the spouse of Jove, And matchless in her charms the Queen of Love. Etherial rapture fills her conscious eyes. As from the royal swain she takes the prize, And seems to say, with looks of soft regard, 290 " Who honour beauty, beauty shall reward." With folded arms, and meek submissive look, The envoy placed the splendid vase, and spoke: ie Imperial Isaac of Comnenus' race Greets you, fair Queens! of Western climes the grace. Soon may your Lord in Sion's ramparts sway And at your feet the conquer'd orient lay: Yet wearied with the voyage, the angry blast. In this blest isle some happy moments waste; And while your mariners prepare again 300 Your shatter'd bark for combat with the main. Taste Nature's lavish bounty, nor decline To pledge our friendship in our island's wine." The Queen received the vase; her glowing hue Changed, as her eyes the awful warning knew: 'Twas but a choice of ills, for ne'er again Her fragile bark may tempt the dangerous maia; Yet soon recover'd, she with pensive air, Her fears dissembling, speaks the envoy fair—
"Wealth, power, and fame Comnenus' days attend,310 The Grecian glory, and the stranger's friend. But let him pardon, if opprest by fear For our loved Lord, we hide our sorrows here. It were discourteous, with these looks of care To mar the pleasures that we cannot share."* The Cypriot train retired, I need not say With what delight I flung disguise away, And told them all; or with what grateful joy They heard of thee, and love, and vengeance nigh." " Ti'* well!" the King replies, " and if again 32J Thou dar'st, my friend, to tempt yon boiling main, Say that just vengeance sleeps not; be it theirs To aid my blows, and combat with their prayers: And tell my love, her sacred cause shall warm With tenfold zeal, and nerve her champion's arm." The morning dawns, the eager warriors stand Arm'd on the decks, and eye the hostile land.,f 2
With such unequal force will Richard tread A n unknown shore, a powerful realm invade? Yes! were the Cypriots thick as Autumn's rain, 330 As leaves on trees, or billows on the main, No doubt had England's dauntless sons confest, While the White Cross is glittering on their breast,* And he, that still the coyest victory won, Their King, their Lion Richard, leads them on. Yet one, a priest, whom age had taught to fear, With cautious counsels vex'd his Sovereign's ear. " Most reverend Clerk!" the impatient Chief replies, " Read o'er thy Scriptures, there we hold thee wise, But know the sword is ours; yet pause—in haste 340 A boat puts off—'tis Pembroke comes at last." 11 He climbs the arduous deck, and climbing speaks, "Descend, О King! and crush these treacherous Greeks, That outrage Heaven and man—Dread Monarch, see Thy friendship spurn'd, thyself despis'd in me. The mean usurper boasts thy Queen detain'd, Unknightly deed! thy shipwreck'd friends enchain'd;
His Seneschal, who dar'd the act arraign, Reft of his ear?, will scarce offend again/ Thou shalt not land! so Isaac swears in scorn, 350 Thou dar'st not land! but is he not forsworn? 1 ' " Aye, my brave Earl! preventive of thy zeal," His King replies, u behold us sheath'd in steel — But don thy casque, that not an arm be lost, We need them all, if his yon glittering host." He ceas'd—the trumpets sound; in fair array Row the swift galleys up Limisso's Bay, While from the castled prow the archers pour Their shafts, a dreadful tempest, on the shore. There stand their foes; in many a rainbow vest 360 The fair form'd mule or foaming steed they prest: As spring the Knights to land, they strive in vain To pierce their mail, or hurl them in the main. On Richaud speeds, while hate and vengeance pour Fresh force in breasts where valour reign'd before; Nor needs the progress of the fight be said, From Europe's strength voluptuous Asia fled. For her slain sons in vain Limisso calls, Nicotia trembles in her distant walls j In vain Comnenus mounts a fresher steed, 3/0 In vain attempts his rallying friends to lead. f3
From such can Richard fly ì can reptiles prove The Lion's match, can eagles fear the dove? But hark! from Paphian hills a joyful shout i Back on his sword return» the flying rout: 'Tis Turnham's well known banner shines on high, 'Tis Harcourťs word of battle rends the sky." Where late they languish'd in a dungeon's gloom And shameless Isaac wiil'd a felon's doom, Urg'd by despair, that fires the noble mind, 380 They burst their fetters and their murderers bind; Three bows were theirs that miss'd their gaoler's ken, One Bosco seiz'd, for knighthood scorn'd not then The woodsman's skill; at every shaft he sends Some hostile bosom bleeds, and death attends. The Greeks recoil, then first compell'd to know The cloth-yard shaft, the force of England's bow. Brave Harcourt seiz'd a-steed: ťí Our fortunes bloom In hope no more, the favouring hour is come 1 ."* So spoke the Knight, his vassals took the word 390 And snatch'd from slaughter'd foes the dart or sword. Meanwhile the Queen addrest her little band í " Those shouts announce the war—my friends, to land!
Fear not for tne, I have a guard on high, Safe if my Richard win, and if he die My doom is fix'd—the ruthless conqueror's chain. Now you may save, but could not aid us then." boon on the shore round noble Albert «bine The gallant Robert, heir of Grosvenor's line; Talbot and Wyndham, following from afar 400 The din of battle, soon they join the war. Prcss'd on all sides the wretched Cypriots bleed; Who runs from Albert's lance, with fruitless speed, Becomes the monarch's prey, and he who flies From Richard's axe, by Harcourt's falchion dies. Thus when some Eastern despot seeks the chase, His numerous train select a woodland space, With shouts and fires the narrowing circuit close Till, forced, th' invaded game affronts the foes; The wolf, the tiger, parti, or tusky boar, 410 By common peril link'd, are foes no more, Each, once the monarch of his sylvan reign, Bleeds, by a random dart ignobly slain -, On every side the ambush'd hunters strike, On all they turn, and bleed on all alike.,f4
Thus fall the Greeks—they glut the weary sword, ~\ Or, loth to perish in a cause abhorr'd, > They yield their weapons, and renounce their Lord.} Short was the conflict, and one summer's sun Beheld a war commenced, a kingdom won. 420 That eve on Isaac's throne the conqueror found The Queens beside him, and his Knights around; Beneath, in silken robes were captives, seen, Fair polish'd caskets, but no gem within; For conquest trod so oft that tempting shore, That change seem'd gain, defeat was shame no more. Contemptuous sneers and scowling looks they cast, On one, their mightiest once, but now the last, The setting moon, so late their idol, scorn, And turn adoring to the rising morn; 430 Not his to find, when fortune's smiles are flown, Above her reach, in every heart a throne. Unhappy Prince! if e'en by pomp opprest, (Like some rude clown for kingly pageant drest, Who struts his hour of borrow'd state, and then, Stripp'd of his robes, to nothing sinks again), At thine own throne a slave, and grovelling low- To one thy pride had forced to be thy foe,
How poor, how less than little art thou grown, Mean in all eyes, and meanest in thine own. 440 But Richard speaks: c< Behold one fleeting hour Has chang'd the scene, has turn'd the tide of pow'r; And now, Usurper, what shall bid me spare? Not e'en that self-distrust, that kindred fear, That Monarch's feel when lawful Kings transgress, And curse the regions Heaven had bid them bless. Speak—why should I withhold the shameful yoke? Why save thee, tyrant, from the headsman's stroke?" Low kneels the humbled Greek, with terror pale, While avarice, shame, and hate, by turns prevail; 450 Now wishes that his glance had power to slay, Now turns, as from some basilisk, away; Fearful of guile, yet ignorant in sooth, How best to force unwonted lips to truth, Through his dark mind, a crafty maze, he tries, But follow's guilt's instinctive course, and lies. Speaks of his grief for wrongs to knighthood shewn, Or highborn dames, their race and claims unknown; Professes deep respect, extols his zeal For Britain's godlike King, and Salem's weal; 460 But reading ill the scornful smile that now Half melts the sable cloud on Rich Aim's brow,
Dares proffer terms of amity—and then Recoils to see the gathering cloud again; Owns all's Ins guilt, but craves a living doom, The strictest chains, the dungeon's darke' gloom, The hardest labour, or in triumph borne To drag his conqueror's car, the public scorn. But spare his life! he offers weight of gold, And costly cups, and gems, and wealth untold. 470 Here spoke stern Richarh: " Would'st thou then resign Part of those spoils, by conquest wholly mine? Or think'st thou, if my will decree thy death, That gold or fawning words shall buy thy breath? Oh! worthy offspring of a treacherous race! The curse of Cyprus, and our faith's disgrace, Vanquish'd, dar'st thou on terms or truce presume, Or blame thy sentence if I speak thy doom?" He ceased; to Isaac present death appears— Prone on the ground, no more he feels or hears; 480 When now the doors unfold, a lovely band Of Cypriote maids before the conqueror stand. Yes! still the Nymphs of Venus' favourite isle Boast her soft glance, her walk, her chastened smile,
Fair as the Ocean foam from whence she sprung, And honey flows from each melodious tongue. They love to wander in Idalian bowers, And wreathe their golden locks with virgin flowers , Or as they strip them from the vernal grove To bid the senseless blossoms whisper love. m 490 But she who, as in birth, in form transcends, Before the throne, a beauteous mourner, bends, And drops her veil; still humble, meek in power, Her gentle spirit rose in danger's hour. The cedar thus, when halcyon summer shines, Graceful to earth its pendant boughs declines, But when on Libanus the snows descend To meet the weight its rising branches bend; And thus Peruvia's bridge of lattice frail, That shakes with every step and every gale, 500 Uninjur'd stands where stone, or stubborn wood Were but the mockery of the foaming flood. While Richard starts to see the vision'd form In beauty beaming, in existence warm; " О King 1" she speaks, " the glory of the West, With native rule, and foreign victory blest, By Him who pleads for erring man above, Whose word is mercy^ whose behest is love,
Nay, by the conquest beaming round thy head, By all the tears thcoe captive virgins shed, 510 In pity to a wretched daughter, hear! And learn of heaven its attribute, to spare. I would not hid thee think 'twas I that braved A father's wrath, or tell thee whom I saved, But that affrighted conscience says too late, That act, tho' guiltless, was my father's fate. 'Tis said thy heart, inflamed with youthful fire, Was once rebellious to a regal sire, Oh î if repentance ever waked a sigh, To pity grant, what justice might deny." 520 Swift from his throne the generous King descends, To raise the fair with courteous grace he bends: íť Rise sweet Evanthe, rise; thy fears resign, At least I war not with a soul like thine." Cheer'd by these accents, though commanding, sweet, SLe looks on him her eye had fear'd to meet; How different from the foe her fancy drew, Horrid with blood, or foul in shape and hue. Tall was his stature, and his auburn hair Curl'd round a face, in youth perchance to< "air, 530
Put war and toil now lent a ruddier glow; A gracious smile relaxed his awful brow, While like that jewel which by turns can shed The softest azure and the naming red, His large dark eye which kindled in the fight Through the long lash now beamed a dewy light. Free flow'd his robes, the sceptre graced his hand As heaven itself had mark'd him for command, While regal pride was veiled in courteous ease, A wish at once and conscious power to please. 540 Thus granite rocks a softer outline show When their sharp peaks are lost in fleecy snow. (l Think not," he said, fi that, aliens to our creed, We joy in blood, and bid a brother bleed: Thy sire is safe, and know, Pjlantacenet Ne'er brook'd an insult, nor forgot a debt; And if my heart should measure what I owe, The vast amount not Cyrus could bestow. I may not, dare not, loose thy father's chain, Ask for thyself, thou shalt not ask in vain." 550 Entranced she stands; her cheeks with pleasure glow, The dreaded conqueror seems no more a foe. Still in her breast unspotted peace had shone And Love with all his woes was yet unknown;
Yet if her fancy wander'd to the theme Such was the hero of her virgin dream, Valour and truth, and mercy's angel smile, But not the languor of an Asian isle. Her grateful soul his gentle speech inhales, And dreads no venom in the fragrant gales. 13G0 Perchance Maimoune hovcr'd near, to dart The subtle poison deeper to her heart. i£ What should I ask," she answered, f< what require? My boon is granted, thou hast spared my sire. And for myself—to knighthood's sure defence Fearless I trust my maiden innocence; Yet if thy bonds my parent must detain, Let me, who shared his grandeur, soothe his pain. Then in my prison's solitary shade, When on my knee reclines his weary head, 570 And to the moon my solemn vespers flow, I'll bless the power that sent so mild a foe; So valiant, that it scarce was shame to bend, So generous, that he seem'd almost a friend." u Ah, no! fair Princess, different far must be The cell, the fetters, fate assigns to thee,
'Twerc sacrilege so fair a form to bind Or shroud in solitude a fairer mind j His prison gates shall open at thy will, And thou in name shalt be my prisoner still, 580 But in my Court, where soon those locks of gold In stronger chains thy conquer'd slaves shall hold. Sec either Queen her gracious arms extend, Λ With theirs thy pursuits and thy thoughts shall blend, > A captive call'd, but honour'd as a friend." ^ He ceased; the Queens embraced the weeping maid With kindly words that half her woes allay'dj When spoke her Sire, from dread of death relieved, Now pride inflam'd his soul, and avarice grieved: " And shall, Oh, Monarch, no respect be shewn 590 To one whose fathers fill'd Byzantium's throne? Shall iron fetters, such as vex the race Of common churls, these regal limbs disgrace?" " Nay, if thou wilt, each silver link shall shine Rich with the splendours of the Indian mine;* Thou wilt but tempt some fool to end thy pain And take thy life, that he may win thy chain.
Thine be whate'er may soothe thy useless years, Thou harmless snake, unworthy hate or fears; Whose secret venom wants the fangs to kill, 600 Curst with the wish, without the power of ill. But thank thy better stars that I withhold The Persian Tyrant's doom; to starve on gold."'' He spoke: the Greeks with smiles obsequious hear, And mock the Tyrant they no longer fear.,END OF BOOK II.

CŒUR DE LION.,BOOK III.,THE NUPTIALS OF RICHARD AND BERENGARIA. Three setting suns have shed a roseate glow, Three dawns in purple bath'd Olympus' brow;* A Pisan bark the fourth returning day Brought either Lusignan to Paphos' bay; And Thoron, flying from a sight abhorr'd, A faithless wife, that weds a second lord; For Philip favours Conrad's lawless will, And Asia's shameless priests his hopes fulfill; * The highest mountain in Cyprus bears the name of Olympus. и 2
While o'er their tarnished fame the good repine, And loathe the day, and fear the wrath divine. 10 The wanderers view'd with wonder and delight St. George's banner stream from every height, With hopes new kindled to the shore they spring, And through fair Cyprus seek her new made King. Within a fane whose light Corinthian grace Once well beseem'd the goddess of the place, The conqueror stands, to claim in peaceful state Th' Imperial Crown his valour won so late. There throng the Greeks, by braided tresses known, The fair straight forehead, and the sweeping gown,20 Or by the graceful lip, contemptuous curl'd At those " Barbarians" of the western world, Who gird a King ador'd, and need not there The bloody axe, or crest of nodding hair, To prove, if Greece such warlike hosts had sway'd, That Greece had triumph'd still, and Rome obey'd. Yet two appear'd amid the festal show Whose hearts reflected no congenial glow; The Cyprian Princess mourns her father's fate, And Salem's Sovereign his degraded state; 30 With tend'rest sympathy he turns to trace The placid sorrow of Evanthe's face.
Oh, Lusignan! scarce yet thy frequent tear Dries on the turf that hides Sybilla's bier, Unwither'd on her modest urn remain Thy votive wreaths, and canst thou love again? Oh, had she smil'd, had pleasure warnťd her eye, Evanthe's charms had fail'd to wake a sigh. He lov'd the grief her downcast looks exprest, And every pang was answer'd in his breast. 40 Weak Prince! too weak for martial souls to prize, Too good to fear, too generous to despise, Sad was the hour which made thee King, that hour Most sad which call'd thee to defend thy pow'r. And why, sweet maid, while timid glances seek The generous Victor, does a brighter streak Now dawn, now fade upon thy beauteous cheek? Love round thy heart has twined a subtle snare, If Hope already cling so fondly there. Yes, he was kind, but pity gave alone 50 That softer cadence to a conqueror's tone; Not only art thou call'd to see him shine In regal honours once expected thine, A trial waits thee: see yon white robed throng That scatter roses as they dance along, And raise to heaven the hymeneal song. g 3
She comes, the Princess of Navarre, to join Her conqu'ring hero at the sacred shrine; For Richard vows that she no more shall brave, Far from his aid, the dangers of the wave. 60 " Henceforth alike we share in joy or pain, One fate shall meet us, and one bark contain. Nay, our own Peers in " Cupid's Court" might prove Us recreant, should we quit this Isle of Love. Now when he laughs on all the blossom'd plains, And jocund May is dancing in our veins, Nor to its Queen her lawful homage pay, But careless fling the offer'd rose away."* While pious awe in Berengaria strove With maiden bashfulness and holiest love, 70 Matilda, second in that princely scene, With rapture hail'd her sister and her Queen. Alas! how different was her bridal hour! In earliest youth, to swell her father's pow'r, Compell'd to change her cloisters' peaceful life, For regal duties and domestic strife:,p. 121.
But pure Religion rul'd her gentle breast, With snares beset, with jealous rage opprest j That spirit which in Richard's ardent soul Wak'd the soft lyre, or urged to glory's goal, 80 Fenced her from all that thoughtless dames allure, And gave that highest courage, to endure. Dear were the hours that she might spend apart, And ease with book or lute her lonely heart. Of suffering virtue, Queens whose bland control Check'd half the fierceness of a tyrant's soul, She read delighted, ponder'd oft and long, And, meekly duteous, verified the song. King William died: she watch'd his parting breath; She could not love him, yefc she wept his death j 90 Wept it in chains, till Richard's awful power From Tancred forced her freedom and her dower.» Now calm in joy, as when her placid brow, Like some still lake, coneeal'd the griefs below, She look'd around, she met a kindly eye, Felt on her glowing cheek a deeper dye, And turn'd from Raymond's gaze her conscious sight To where, completed every nuptial rite, The pious King devoutly kneeling âown To England's Primate gave the Cyprian Crown. b 100 g 4
With loyal tears the aged Baldwin shed The sacred chrism; next placed on Rich a an' s head Th' imperial gold, and gave to either hand The orb of empire and the royal wand. Then to the Lord of Hosts preferr'd his prayer, " Oh, make this monarch and his realms thy care! Twice has thy servant heard his regal vow, Twice fix'd the precious garland on his brow. Strong in thy might, may he on Syria's plain, Or Sion's hill, sublimer wreaths obtain! 110 Wreaths that shall flourish in unfading bloom When Cyprus sinks beneath the general doom; When earth and all its glories melt away, And like a scroll the shrivell'd heav'ns decay." Then, smiling on the Queen, with many a gem Enrich'd, he plac'd the nuptial diadem. " To thee, illustrious Virgin, we consign A nation's hopes, and be its blessings thine î From thee the matrons of a virtuous land The bright example of their lives demand, J 20 So vice and shame thy radiant sphere shall fly, Loathe their own foulness, and neglected die; Thy worth a grateful nation shall proclaim, And with thy Lord's entwine thy lasting fame."
How fares Evanthe now? a sudden start Has to herself reveal'd her treach'rous heart; Instant she droop'd her lovely head, and drew Her azure veil to hide her changing hue; Speechless and motionless: yet some had guest By the convulsive heavings of her breast, 130 She wept in anguish o'er her alter'd lot, And mourn'd for honours, in her grief forgot. Yet when she rais'd her veil with calmer air, Mild beam'd her eye, no ling'ring tear was there. It needs not here the bridal sports to tell; What knights in tilting or Castilles exceli; c How oft the pageant foe was forced to run, How oft in sport was mimic Acre won; What minstrel's harp best pleas'd the warlike throng, Or how the gen'rous King repaid the song; 140 What princely presents waited every guest, What gay profusion graced the bridal feast;* Even royal eyes were dazzled to behold The martial pomp, the blaze of gems and gold f
There ev'ry luxury England deem'd her own, Or Asia prized, to England then unknown, Invite the taste; the stag, the brindled boar, The swan, the pheasant, all that swim or soar," Or range the hill, the forest, and the field; With every fruit that Cyprian gardens yield; 150 On massy chargers piled, with myrtles green, And loveliest flowers in fragrant groups between. A thousand Chiefs, in ermined robes arrayed, With each a noble dame or high-born maid, Surround the board, and each distinguish'd pair From the same plate partake their mutual fare.* While squires of gentle lineage train'd to serve, To fill the jewell'd goblet, and to carve, Present the spicy pigment, flaming wines Press'd from the golden grapes of Cyprian vines/160 Clairette in fuming beakers, and the juice s Th' industrious bees from Paphian flowers produce. Soon through the festive throng commingled rise Convivial sounds, jests, laughter, gay replies,
Confused, not inharmonious; Mirth that hour Ruled with despotic, unresisted power; And though unshrined, the Queen of gay desire In each soft bosom wak'd her former fire; Love from a thousand eyes elanced his dart, While broken sighs reveal'd the conscious heart, 170 And valour, vanquish'd by superior arms, A willing captive bow'd to Beauty's charms. No words can paint the changes of the scene, And each fantastic interlude between. 11 Now on the board, with martial trophies graced, A troop of Fauns a stately laurel placed, A myrtle, gay with flowers of bridal white, And last a rose, sweet emblem of delight; While gaudy birds, as in their native bow'r, Sing from the blossomed shrub and fragrant flow'r. 180 When now that God for whom such flowers are worn, Who gives to life its sweetness and its thorn, Springs from the rose, and with his dart of gold Strikes on the myrtle, lo! its boughs unfold! And Venus with her favourite jasmine crown'd, The table circling with a frolic round, The prize of beauty she receiv'd of yore On Ida's mount to Berengaria bore.
Now brays the trumpet; the vast laurel heaves With labouring throes, and shakes through all its leaves; 190 The clang of arms is heard, the courser's neigh, The rush of fight, the shout of victory; When from the opening branches sternly strode, Sublime in burnish'd arms, the Warrior-God, Bears to the King the palm to valour due; Then, while the clarions shrill their notes renew, Again the involving boughs the Gods invade, And jolly Fauns remove the mystic shade. Now sprightlier music sounds; to dance and song \ Life's sweetest hours, the hours of eve belong. 200> A spacious bower receiv'd the princely throng: j High rose the pillar'd roof, the stems around The wanton vine her graceful foliage wound, And on the trel laced arches over head With love's own woodbine wreath'd, her tendrils spread,* And all seemed nature, save the lamps, which hung Like trembling stars the fluttering leaves among.
There, hid in clouds of fleecy white, that came From cedar, myrrh, and aloe's fragrant flame, Maimoune hovering nigh, beheld with pain 210 Her spells, by heavenly influence render'd vain; The dream forgot, the monarch's mighty mind Wholly to love, but lawful love, resign'd; And pale Evanthe, sorrowing yet serene, With zeal unfeigned attend her beauteous Queen. " Think not," the Peri cries, with bitter smile, " Thy feeble soul Maimoune's arts can foil: The poison slumbers now, but thou may'st feel Some wounds are deadliest when they seem to heal." Threat' ning she fled, her heart with sorrow fill'd,220 Her lucid form in dewy tears distill'd. Etherial tears 1 When morning breezes blow, *\ They wake in flowers, yet not such flowers as know > The nectar-seeking bee, for theirs is empty show.} The dance is hush'd, the harp no longer fires The languid limb, the sated troop retires j And sinks in silent streets the jovial cry Of homeward guests beneath the moonlight sky. Fairest of Berengaria's maiden train Was Hermesind, an orphan child of Spain. 230
Wide Avere her lands, her parents' only heir, \ Early they left her, and their dying care > Chose for her home the Court of high Navarre. 1 j Fleet in the dance, and like the lark in song, Through life's young hours she bounded light along; Proud to behold of knights a gallant train, Slaves of her charms, but heedless of their pain, Nor thought, by flatt'ry's inward glass betray'd, That she might feel them, or that youth could fade. Th' Idalian jasmine cluster'd o'er the bower 240 Where, in the coolness of the midnight hour, While the bright moon her silver radiance threw O'er Paphian groves, and ocean's boundless blue, She sate revolving looks, and words, and sighs, And all the fancied victims of her eyes; The warmth of Lusignan's imagined glance, The crowds that watch'd her thro' the mazy dance, And why young Pardo, dear to England's King, Should first to her the spicy pigment bring, While sad Ricardo saw with jealous gaze 250 The plumy fan she dropp'd, another raise. So deep she mused, a solitary skiff Had shot unmark'd from high Colosso's cliff;*
Veil'd in a mantle dark, a form was seen, That touch'd with tuneful skill the mandoline; k Too well she knew the voice whose mournful strain Now breathed prelusive o'er the Cyprian main: Oh! none in Sancho's court with happier aim Could pierce the ring, the raging bull could tame; For princely race, for manly virtues known, 260 And for a heart that felt for her alone. For years with patience her disdain he bore, At length he vow'd to wear her chains no more. None knew his fate, but weeping maids believ'd That Arga's stream th' unhappy youth receiv'd.* Grief for her victim spread through Ebro's vale, While the proud beauty feign'd to scorn the tale. Yet through her heart a secret pleasure ran, As thus with steady voice the Knight began: Lady, thou hast thought me dead— 270 Did one pang thy heart discover? Deign'd thine eye one tear to shed O'er thy fond, thy wretched lover?
If the scorn of long past hours Be in that cold breast remaining, Glory in thy beauty's powers! Pride thee in thine art of paining! Pride thee that I love thee still, That my heart from thee must borrow, As thy frown or smile shall will, 280 All its rapture, all its sorrow! Pride thee î for thine empire flies— Thou no more shalt hear my story, In the grave affection dies; Palestine has tombs of glory. Yet, and Lady, for thy sake, Hope would nurse the precious blossom, Now, if better thoughts awake, Now if pity warm thy bosom; This fond breast to Hope restore, 290 Time nor chance our love shall sever; Trifle with my pain once more, And my tongue is dumb for ever.
Her victim lives! from unacknowledged grief E'en Hermesind's light heart confcst relief; But pride revives—another owns her power, And wakes the echoes at this silent hour With equal sweetness. Fi r 'd by deadliest rage, The jealous rivals in their skiffs engage j Brightly the weapons flash'd in Cynthia's ray, 300 And Ocean's ruffled waves expect their prey, When the coy maid, rous'd by the clash of arms, Threw back the lattice: r ' Why these rude alarms? Whence, and who are ye, warriors; what the cause That to this spot your midnight fury draws? Respect a virgin's rest, respect the night, And strive on shore, or wait the dawning light." " Oh, fairest Hermesind!" Ricardo said, " Too well thou know'st—but be thy will obey'd. Alas! when night is in her awful noon, 310 And all is slumb'ring, save the pitying moon That hears my woes, must I no longer breathe My secret sighs, thy sacred bower beneath?" " Know thee!" exclaim'd the unrelenting fair, (i Hence, maťlman, hence, lest royal Richard hear, Or I arouse the guard; and from my view, Thou, muffled stranger!—do I know thee too?—" vol. i. h
" Yes! scornful Hermesind, thou know'st me well, As conscience oft in lonely hours shall tell; Long hast thou known—but I no more endure 320 Taunts still renew'd, I thank thee for my cure. Behold this glove, which, more than empires dear, I long have worn, and ever thought to wear; Now from this relic of my shame I part, And with it fling the giver from my heart. And thou, young stranger, break like me her chain, The yoke's inglorious, its reward is pain. Thou know'st me not, but I like thee have lov'd, Like thee been flatter'd, courted and reprov'd; Been ăcorn'd like thee, till ev'ry hope was gone, 330 And injur'd reason totter'd on her throne. Like me, but oh! with less of pain, be wise, I cannot love the being I despise; Or crouch like Persian satraps round a throne, Opprest, and kept for vanity alone. For her lost victim let her now deplore, But living never shall she see me more." He ceas'd, his bark shot swiftly from the bay; Ricardo staid, to softer thoughts a prey: He marvell'd at the tongue which thus reprov'd, 340 Nor saw a blemish in the maid he lov'd;
Ling'ring till she the jealous lattice drew, And Heaven appear'd to vanish from his view. Eight suns on laughing Cyprus rose and set, And Richard linger'd in the island yet. Though wing'd with new delight the hours advance, The chase, the joust, the banquet and the dance; And he the foremost of the martial throng, Alike directs the galliard, or the song, Affronts the boar, or shares with lance and shield 850 The mimic warfare of the listed field: Yet, as the magnet constant, Richard's soul Through all these seeming wand'rings sought its pole; His galleys, long of winds and waves the sport, Now ride triumphant in the crowded port. New laws he frames, he checks each nascent wile, And in his sway confirms the wavering isle; While Cyprian vales the graceful plane resign, Her hills the oak, the ash, the tap'ring pine; To frame huge engines, whence his ambush'd powers \ May spring on Acre's Avails, or dreadful show'rs V Of stones and fire assail her haughty towers. 1 y With no gradations of declining light, That wed the day so softly to the night, h2
No clouds that borrow, wliile they veil his rays, Ethereal hues that vary as we gaze, Sunk the broad sun, the shades of night extend O'er all the isle, and cooling dews descend. Tired of the bow^ the hunt, the martial play, Tired of the lighter sports that closed the day, 3/0 With mirth, with Cyprus' luscious wines opprest, ïn tent or bower the warriors sink to rest. Not so their Chiefs—the feast, the minstrel's song, Eve's fleeting hours in Richard's hall prolong; And should once more our long-lost Arthur reign, Or spells recall the Knights of Charlemagne, Scarce should those vaunted Paladins be found Of princelier rank, or more in arms renown'd. The injured Count, and exiled monarch there The highest seats with noble Raymond share.* 380 Where fair Toulouse in distant prospect sees O'er olive groves the snow-crowned Pyrenees, He ruled, from that heroic leader sprung Whom Godfrey honour'd, and whom Tasso sung.
f J is gentle ί,οαΐ at Acre hopes to find A Kinsman's welcome from a kindred mind, Nor knew, by grief and base reproaches torn, His reason warp'd, his life untimely shorn. Next snilen Bertrand, who'* e imperious sway Strong Hanteforťb lowers and Porigueux obey; 390 By heirship one he held, (the castled height), And one by force usurp'd^ his brother's right. His, scowling brow and glassy eye confest Despair and rancour brooding at his breast. Yet who so ardent iu the desperate fight? Whove mirth was louder on the festal night? Or who of all that struck the minstrel lyre In loftier numbers breathed Tyrtæan lire '<· l Yet downcast now in Richard's sight he sate, And moody silence veil'd his deadly hate. 400 Far other thoughts three gallant youths inspire, Who loved the generous monarch as their sire. Young Pardo first, his birth in mystery veil'd, Nam'd from the leopards that adorn'd his shield: On that same shield, in splendid robes array'd. Before King Henry's gate the babe was laid; When Rich \rd pass'd, its infant smiles engage The youthful prince—he train'd him for his Page.
Then pleas'd to find his vigorous soul aspire To deeds of glory, bred the favourite Squire; 410 And scarce three happy moons had waned away Since by his valour in Messina's fray" The gilded spurs he gain'd, and right to wield That mystic blazon in the martial field. To all was Pardo dear—in Richard burn'd A father's love, with equal love return'd. Nor less Ricardo felt the grateful flame, Nor less his generous thirst of martial fame: Yet would he oft the social feast refuse, In secret shades to court the wayward muse; 420 In gayer hours the mirth that lit his eye, Was like the sunbeam from a wat'ry sky. High was his birth, his sire and lovely bride On Ceuta's shore in Moorish bondage died; Left almost in the hour that gave him breath In barbarous hands, and doom'd to bonds or death, The good Justinian heard, his ready sword To Christian lands his brother's child restor'd; By Richard in his father's rights install'd, He from himself the noble orphan call'd, 430 But (for the youth from southern Poitou came) His vassals to Ricardo changed the name.
Nor less Northumbrian Albert; firm and bold His mind, bis form from Nature's fairest mould, With youth's frank cheerfulness sedate and sage, His was the wisdom of maturer age. The last blythe May had deck'd with odorous flowers His bridal revel in the Cestrian towers, And Richard heard the holy vows unite Cyveilioc's daughter and th' enamour'd knight.* 440 The bride had borne, to crown the nuptial feast, The peacock proud in gaudy plumage drest, With Eastern spices rich, and gems of price, Placed on a golden dish of rare device. 0 To greet the royal bird, with naked sword, The King had/risen from the festal board: Each eye expectant watch'd his thoughtful brow, Each heart revolv'd the meditated vow; When from without a plaintive cry was heard, '* Vengeance, brave Monarch! by that honour'd.bird, By him who reigns above!" a troop was seen In pilgrim garments, but of martial mien; Lame, blind, and seam'd with many a dreadful scar, Tlie sad remains of unsuccessful war.,h 4
" Behold the relics of a faithful train, Who fought for Palestine, but fought in vain! We vow'd to tame the Soldan's impious pride, And free that region where Emanuel died. Behold us now 1 Oh King, avenge our doom! Arm! England, arm! redeem the sacred tomb." 460 Each lady's eye with pious tears was fill'd, Each manly breast with martial ardour thrill'd; But most the King's—when Pandulph's holy words Charm'd to their sheaths his own and Philip's swords- Long since he took the cross, but wars oppos'd And civil strife: till now, his realm compos'd, His stores prepar'd, the injur'd wretches came, By heaven inspired to rouse the latent flame. " Before the Peacock and the Dames I swear, Nor thought of earthly power, nor regal care, 4/0 Nor my near nuptials, shall delay me now; Too long has Heaven arraign'd the slighted vow: Now be it paid! my gallant Peers arise- Now by this royal bird, your ladies' eyes, Your fame, your faith, whoe'er would share my heart, In arms complete at once with me depart." He spoke; his vassals caught the martial glow, And with fantastic fancies bind the vow.
Albert was last; awhile he paus'd and sigh'd, Then took the oath which tore him from his bride.480 Next sate D'Arselles, and high St. Valery's heir, p And stout St. John,' 1 and Arnulph of St. Clair; r Harvey, w T hose axe was never rais'd in vain; s And Nevile, skilful on the troubled main/ Spencer, 11 whose name was to his office due, And Ferrars' x valiant Earl; and Fortescue,* Sprung from that Richard, who on Hastings' field Before Duke William bore the guardian shield. Grosvenor/ whose house held kindred with the Dane, That won by daring arms his Norman reign; 490 And him more great, the last that e'er shall claim From England's prostrate strength a Conqueror's name: By Deva's wizard stream, the noble race Awake her echoes with their sylvan chace; Yet foremost now in Sion's cause advance, And chiluge trie boar-spear for the sterner lance.
Then Leicester's Earl, than whom no braver Lord* E'er couch'd a spear: his filial grief deplor'd A noble sire; like him the cross he w T ore, But in Romania died, nor reach'd the sacred shore. The brave de Vaux/ in arms a mighty name; And Roland, who from stout Belasius came; aa And veteran Talbot, who in Aquitain, When Sarum's regent Earl by fraud was slain, To find his heiress, then a blooming maid, In minstrel garb his martial limbs array'd; Mid hills abrupt, and woods, and valleys green, Where winds, with isles begemm'd, the placid Seine, To Neustria's hinds of sylvan game he sung, Or told of war her warlike Knights among, 510 Had lays of love to win a lady's ear, And lighter jests, the menial throngs to cheer. At length by Eu's romantic cliffs he came, \ Where her false guardians hid the lovely dame, S> Heiress of Rosmar's lands and Ewrus' fame. J
Nor long he harp'd in vain: 'twas his to bring The rescued Ela to his generous King; Who sooth'd her griefs, and with her father's land Gave to a princely spouse her willing hand. His brother, born in that mysterious bower 520*4 Which Henry framed, to shun his consort's power, > With Dædalean art for beauty's fairest flower . ьь ^ Next, nor unmindful of his sister's shame, De Clifford* sate, himself of spotless fame; Firm, agile, brave, though now in life's decline; And Curzon's pride, the youthful Giraline." Three Saxons next, fair-hair'd and azure-eyed; Stourton, whose Patriarch pour'd Sabrina's tide O'er the rich vales, and guarding Avalon, Peace, safety, honour, from the Conqueror won.f 530 Compton,*!: whose grandsire, doubting Harold's claim, Withheld his feudal aid when William came;
And Harley,* 1 * 1 sprung from that victorious Thane, In Saxon days the terror of the Dane; With Godfrey's twined his grandsire's laurels bloom, Who took monastic t ows, a Champion of the Tomb. The noble Harcourť e next, in whom combine The Saxon, Danish, and Burgundián line; Himself a Briton, to his brethren yields His, Norman honors and paternal fields. 540 Berkeley and Pembroke, who with Strigulph share The conquer'd spoils, and fame of Erin's war." Two brothers next—on Audley's crimson shield Still Lydulph bears the golden fret reveal'd; But Adam claims, since Stanley's lands he gained, The silver stags upon an azure bend. gs Then high-born Alan, joyful to retain With Percy's name the Lion of Lorraine;
In barbarous times, ere Rollo's daring sails His raven banner spread to British gales, 550 The Norman name ere vanquish'd Ncustria bore, Had Danish Mainfred aw'd the Gallic shore. His brave descendants to our fairer isle Tass'd with the Conqueror, and partook her spoil; But William, to his royal namesake dear, *\ Would with no Norman bride his honours share, > But wedded her who should have been their heir; j Hence, when he bravely fell in Palestine, Allow'd to see, but not to reach, the Shrine, His weeping Squires to widow 'd Emma bore 560 His faithful heart, and where it touch'd the shore She rais'd St. Hilda's fane, a mighty tomb, And wept her cheerless days in cloistered gloom; Yet oft to heaven her grateful eyes would raise, When trumpets spoke her youthful Alan's praise. Seven sons were his, all courteous, pious, brave, Alas! their valour won an early grave. And Peers and Princes hasten'd to demand, Percy's last hope, their sister Agnes' hand. Wisely she chose the gallant Josceline; 570 Nor he, though brother to the English Queen,
Though sprung from one allied with Charlemagne, The powerful Duke of Brabant and Lorraine, And kin to him who conquer'd Sion's throne, Disdain'd to make their lofty name his own. In Whitby's pile they sleep, his brother's care Now guards their Alan's bride, and infant heir. He sails, by pious zeal to Syria driven, His name renown'd on earth, his t( Hope in Heaven." 1,11 Next the proud Norman, Perceval was seen, 580 Rapacious, cruel, arrogant of mien: Fit heir of her, who when her castle spread Its walls complete, struck off the builder's head; Who dared in arms against her husband stand, And fell, the victim of his vengeful hand. Fit heir of Ascelin, whose dreadful crest (A gaping wolf) his nature half exprest; Wiio with a hand of steel, and heart as hard, Dire pains for Bretevil's captive Earl prepar'd. Perchance the influence of a milder age 590 In their descendant curb'd ancestral rage, Yet hated, fear'd, alike by friend or foe, His look appall'd, and death was in his blow."
Next Rodney—start not, Britain, at the name í Cť From timid doves the Eagle never came."* That name which taught thy stubborn foes to yield Thy rightful empire o'er the azure field, Was known to fame, o'er traitorous billows bore A Norman victor to thy white-cliff'd shore. But pause, oh Muse! nor thus thy strain prolong, All cannot share, though all deserve the song. And ye, blest Spirits, if ye now behold, Where crown'd with palms ye fill your thrones of gold, Your once lov'd England; if that gen'rous glow Which urg'd to fame on earth, inspire ye now, Forgive your Bard, whose plumes too venťrous grown Melt in the sunlight of your high renown; Propitious hear! the mists of time unroll, Pour your forgotten glories on my soul, So yours (nor less your proud achievements claim) 610 Shall vie with Roland or Rinaldo's fame.
And hark the King, " Alas! the promised land Near, yet not oursj for angry seas withstand; Fate frowns malign: in vain we pant to share The harvest Philip reaps already there. Say! shall we then these sultry moons beguile In these green bowers, this cool delicious isle, Or launch our frail and shattered keels again, Mid all the terrors of an adverse main? Methinks the rose is richest of perfume 620 Though Fame's dark leaf outlive its fleeting bloom." " Can Richard speak of pausing?" Raymond cried, É< Or spoke his accents what his heart denied?, Like thee we love, when fortune's gales are bland, To win her odorous wreath from pleasure's hauti, , And snatch each jewel from her shining store, Like thee we court her smile, but Glory more. Reluctant Fame already weeps to twine, On brows less brave, the honours meant for thine; Reviving Acre breathes, her tottering wall 630 Again is firm, till thou shalt doom its fall." " Behold!" cried Pardo, c( where these groves have dew'd My crimson'd arms—they should be stains of blood.
Will Asia's fervid suns unnerve us more Than the soft joys of this voluptuous shore? Let Ocean rave, and summon every blast, So he but waft us to our port at last; So Acre's towers resign their scornful boast, And learn that Richard is himself an host." "Bravethough it be, young warrior,"Bertrand said, '*■ The host you prize but wields a single blades And though its owner scorn to pause for breath, A single blow but gives a single death. Ill can I brook delay, or stoop to fear, Yet would not leave this isle unguarded here} 'Tis but the rash that think not of defeat, The prudent, ere they fight, ensure retreat. The Vampyre fans the sleeper into death, But mine, thank heav'n! is not a flatterer's breath; Not one brave arm a victory can decide." 650} " No 1 by my troth!" the laughing King replied, > * e Or thine to conquest were unerring guide. j Thanks for thy love of Richard, generous youth! Thanks, noble Bertrand, for thy love of truth! If to my arm superior strength be given, 'Tis Heaven's, I lift it in the cause of Heaven; vol. ι. ι
Yet, Count, of all that pledge this cup with me, I least had dreamt such sage advice from thee! With pride, my friends, í find your spirits high, Unbending brook this enervating sky; 660 Up S Vidal, up! why sleeps thy martial lyre? Strike the bold strings, and fan the noble fire." From proud Toulouse the favourite minstrel came, A hand of iron, and a soul of flame. Of mean descent, with Prince and Peer he vied, Some wayward planet craz'd his brain with pride; While love, which wiser souls of sense has reft, Usurp'd the little light conceit had left, And oft his slave to wilder pranks betray'd Than Mancha's Knight, or mad Orlando play'd. 6/0 He vaunts himself all human worth above, Each warrior's fear, and every lady's love. The youthful Knights, whose mirth such folly bred, By turns his wand'ring fancy mock'd and ied, And late, when Richard's nuptial bonds were tied, They joined the minstrel with a royal bride, By faint and distant lineage link'd with one That sway'd, or claim'd, Byzantium's fickle throne. Nor needed more, he grasps the glittering bait, Assumes a throne, and apes imperial state. 680
Yet his no madness of the vulgar mind; With flame divine, like sad Cassandra's, join'd, Proud of his tuneful art he swept the strings, Taught faith to nations, government to kings. Not wintry torrents roll a flood so strong, Nor night's sweet chantress pours so rich a song. Each willing sense was wrapt when Vidal su^g, And wondering wisdom warbled from his tongue. kk Of Arthur's pomp, and Carduel's towers he told, The Christmas feast, and deeds of Gawaine bold;690 What giants for his lady's love he slew,* What castles storm'd, what valiant knights o'erthrew. Or, 'mid th' insidious dangers of the feast, How his tried courtesy withstood the test; One word that breathed refusal or command, Had been a signal to the murderer's hand. f Entranced the warriors hear; the song inspires The soul of war, and kindles all their fires; But when the minstrel quits the field of arms For Gawaine's happy love, his lady's charms, 700 Then Richard spoke: " No more pursue the strain, Lay down thy harp, or sing of arms again.,. 2
Those bursting sighs, and downcast looks attest Thy power too well, in pity spare the rest; While distant thus through dang'rous climes we roam, Thou must not lead our truant fancies home. Nay, Lords! I merit neither smile nor sneer, Though newly join'd in bliss, my bride be here, Not from the fondest lover in my band Can England's name a deeper sigh demand; J\0 And she perchance, my first affianc'd spouse, Now blames my wand'ring steps and slighted vows." " Nay, my lov'd Liege! in vain would England blame While here thy conqu'ring arm asserts her fame," Ricardo spoke; " but just thy care, to chain Th' unheeding minstrel in his amorous strain. Proud of his airy empire, he controuls, Without remorse, our weak plebeian souls. See where brave Albert, lost in trance profound, With some ideal image paints the ground: 720 Yet here I rush on rocks; he ill can bear That prying wit should note his changing cheer." Proud Albert's heart the rising pang supprest, And with a guarded smile retorts the jest. ťí Methinks a bride so fair, and left like mine, Might wake a sigh from any breast—but thine!
Enjoy the quiet of a loveless heart, Laugh, while thou canst, at those who feel the smart; Yet some havedreamt that thou hastchang'd thy cheer, And vail'd thy crest when Hermesind was near." 730 Breath'd by what voice soe'er, that magic name Still o'er Ricardo like an icebolt came; Died on his quiv'ring lips the gay reply, Droop'd his sad head, and sunk his lively eye; And, conscious of the laugh, he tries in vain To find his wonted cheer, and laugh again. When Pardo rose, he held the goblet high, And mirth shone graceful in his eagle eye. "Health! lovers, health! may all your hopes be crown'd, Your happy heads with wreaths of myrtle bound. 740 But be the laurel mine—my eager sword! Λ While victory guides, and youth and health afford \ Sound sleep by night and spirit at the board, y I covet not to lie long nights awake, And fast or perish for my lady's sake; Of pleasing pains the mystic charms repeat; I would not mix the bitter with the sweet. Let some soft smile your martial rage inspire, In me my monarch wakes as proud a fire; ι 3
Though sighs and tender tears inflame your zeal, 7^ His glance as deep shall urge my thirsty steel. Oh! for that hour, when Acre's tott' ring pride \ Shall see our rival prowess fairly tried."— \ He spoke, the Monarch with a smile replied: * " Pardo, we know thee brave, yet think not thou That Albert's riper fame to thine shall bow, Till stoops thy soul to sovereign beauty's right; A loveless warrior is but half a Knight, A moving statue, wise or brave in vain, An empty nut, a head without a brain. 700 But this is sport:—Avignon's shadowy ease Were fitter scene for idle themes like these. T'were meet that now our brother King declare The Moslem strength, and state of Asia's war; Say, Lusignan, for on our distant shores Wild, wond'rous tales fallacious Rumour pours. What is this mighty man, this Saladine, The Asian boast, and scourge of Palestine? Some paint an Ogre, drunk with Christian blood, A giant, foul in form, and fierce in moodj jyo While some employ the rainbow's softer hues, \ One that by mercy, more than arms subdues, v A godlike soul, that angels weep to lose. у
Say, must we as to hunt some beast prepare, That claims no common courtesy of war > Spurn pleading mercy, yield the reins to rage, Or fight as men with fellow men engage?" He ceas'd, and deep the exiled Monarch sigh'd, ч One moment prest his burning brow, to hide \ The rush of painful thought, and then replied: 78θ} " There was a time, my torn and tortured mind Could scarce believe him sprung of human kind, But youth's wild heat is past; to heav'n I bow, And own him worthy to be Richard's foe. Not more to others than himself severe; Patient of toil, unboastful though austere: No cottage falls to swell his shining hoard, No peasant starves to pile his groaning board; Nor lust of spoil nor love of power inspires, But bigot zeal his restless fury fires; 790 This zeal in youth the Fatimite subdued, This zeal in age is fed with Christian blood. 11 In Antioch's towers thy mother's eye could find In him a spirit form'd to rule mankind;*
Though then a boy, no thirst of fame he shew'd, And pleasure's smile with boyish heat pursued. But as the tiger cub, once flesh'd in gore, Disdains the proffer'd dug, and thirsts for more, His latent greatness burst th' ignoble spell, He join'd his uncle, and Káhira fell. 800 Noureddin's slave, but traitor to his son, Egypt he seiz J d, and next Damascus won; His brother conquer'd Yemen's flowVy land, And Mosul's lord »vas vassal of his hand f m And Palestine—Ah! bid me not proclaim My fatal reign, my sorrow and my shame."'" 1 Here Richard hastes to speak: i( 0! Monarch! cast Thine eyes before, nor sorrow o'er the past. Conquest, in hostile blood already dyed, Floats o'er our van, and spreads our banner wide. 810 Thus blest by Heav'n, bid cank'ring thought depart, And yield that best return, a cheerful heart. Yet say, for thou wert in the Moslem yoke, How was thy life preserved, thy bondage broke?" " That eve which closed Tabaria's fatal strife, I lived, a wretched captive, doom'd to life; I and Chatillon—to the Soldan's tent They led us bound, unknowing where we went.
He press'd a plain divan, by which was set His plainer meal, dried dates and iced sherbet. 820 To me his hands the cooling bowl extend: Fearless I drank, and pass'd it to my friend. But then the Soldan's rage in thunder broke, ' Drink not, Chatillon, drink not Thou V he spoke y i To Thee that pledge of safety I deny, Thou perjur'd Knight, renounce thy faith or die.' ť I have not courted danger, Hv'd in strife,' The Knight return'd, * to barter Heav'n for life; And for the broken truce, if guilt there be, 'Twere worse to league with infidels like thee/ 830 " The Monarch brook'd no more, he snatch'd his blade, And at my feet down dropp'd Chatillon's head. °° I saw and shudder'd—then in Ascalon For many a moon my wretched life crept on. (k Meanwhile, deserted Sion strove in vain— Compell'd at length to own the Soldan's reign; 11 ' Nor was he stern—he spared the prostrate foe, And fix'd the price of liberty so low, That, but protracted conflict drain'd the land, Her poorest sons had paid the mild demand.* 840
Then rose through all her streets a fearful cry, As ^ese lament to stay, and those to fly: Friend clung to friend; one wail'd his captive doom, One eyed with ling'ring looks the Sacred Tomb. FromDavid'sgate the conquering Chiefs look'd down* On the sad pomp slow winding from the town. Silent the exiles pass'd, nor dared to raise To their deserted homes their tearful gaze; But from within discordant wailings rose, And wilder grief, till pity touch'd their foes. 850 A thousand captives generous Adel freed, And Mestoc hastes to emulate the deed; Till Saladine, still prompt at pity's call, Bids wide the jealous gates unfold for all; To want and age extends a prompt relief, And gifts and kindness dry the tears of grief, f " Now came in sable stoles a female train, Who wept their wedded lords enthrall'd or slain: And one was there of more exalted mien, Supreme in grief, my dear, my wretched Queen, 860
Though woman's countless charms in vain had shone To change a heart where honour rul'd alone, He who but once refus'd a woman's prayer,* With manly sorrow felt her mute despair; ť Weep not! thy lord has shar'd the bowl with me, And the twelfth moon,' he said, ' shall find him free.—' "чч Here Richaed, kindling, cries, c< And such a deed Atones Chatillon's blood!—may fortune speed Our arms to mutual proof—my friend, proceed." " Those moons roll'd on, and to my gloomy cell 870 Came my sweet Sybill', and my fetters fell. I flew to Tyre—but saved by Conrad's sword From Moslem rule, it spurn'd its former lord; To Acre then my little band I drew— To guard Ше town tbe wary Soldan fleW— My doom seem'd near, when all at once descried, Three Christian fleets mov'd proudly o'er the tide.f First mid an English, Norman, Frison train Came thy brave nephew, Henry of Champagne;
Next Austria's haughty ruler sprung to shore; 880 The third small fleet the fervid Conrad bore. Ev'n then had Acre fall'n, but Egypt's train With arms and food supplied her from the main. Two winters now the lingering siege had view'd, And the third spring had dyed the plains with blood, When Philip came; yet still her ramparts stand, Nor yield to less than English Richard's hand." He ceas'd! but Richard spoke not; lost in thought, A wond'rous plan his mighty spirit wrought; Then smiling, from his pilgrim purse he drew 890 Bright leathern thongs of ether's deepest blue: " The knight," hecried, "who seeks this badge to bear, Must never shrink from toil, or stoop to fear; This round his knee, a proud distinction, worn,* Let France deride, or Islam feign to scorn, Soon one with dread, with envy one shall see, And yield the palm to English Chivalry. This when the sabre lops the princely crest, And one deep red obscures th' emblazou'd vest, Despite the ciobe-barr'd vizor, shall proclaim 900 lis breach or desperate field our England's, fame.
Yet not to all I give—his happy Ιοί \ Who gains may bless; nor he who gains it not, S- May deem his worth disgrac'd, his deeds forgot. J Let him that wears it, combat to maintain, And him that wears not, emulate to gain: So shall our foes, like timorous sparrows flee, And Acre fall, and Palestine be free." rr He spoke, each bosom felt the proud appeal, Beat high with hope, and glow'd with generous zeal; Then first to Pembroke (as their years demand), And Clifford's Earl, he gave the purple band; Harcourt and Harley next, with ardent eyes, And noble Percy, glory in the prize; Leicester and Ferrars then, and Talbot share 4 The envied badge; then Berkeley, Stourton wear; > Nevile, and Grosvenor, Percival, St. Clair; j Albert, St. John, and noble Fortescue, And Rodney next, receive the glorious blue. It adds fresh grace to Spencer's antient name, 920 To Roland's pride and youthful Stanley's fame. Harvey, De Vaux, with warmer zeal inspires; And last, not least, the noble Audley fires.
Bright emulation springs in every mind, While, these exult to wear, and those to bind; And Pardo, as on Albert's knee he prest The radiant Garter, thus his friend addrest: iC I will not envy, but by yonder moon, E'er thrice she wane, thou wear'st it not alone." Twice twelve, around their valiant Monarch stand, Matchless in arms, an azure-cinctured band, And he the loftiest yields without controul To that high impulse all his regal soul. " Vidal! thy harp 1"—and, touch'd with minstrel fire, His rapid fingers struck the trembling wire. Swift to the pillar'd porch he led the way; The landscape glittered in the moon's bright ray, And through the light acacia's feathery shade, As through a veil of gauze, her radiance play'd, While the tall palm-trees rear'd their trunks on high, And wav'd their dusky plumes against the sky. Before them, Ocean's bright expanse was spread, Behind, Olympus rear'd his snow-capp'd head. Here mid his Peers, the Monarch pour'd along The mingled tide of harmony and song.
ťí Fair Regent of the summer sky! How oft, when all was still and mute, In thy clear ray my tender lute Has wak'd soft strains of love-sick melody; How oft, when from th' unfmish'd fight 930 The sun withdrew his envious light, I bade thy fickle beam the day supply, And forced from wond'ring Night reluctant Victory. " Bright Queen of Heaven! I come not now To breathe the amorous sigh, or stain With blood and death thy silent reign; I hail thee witness to a lofty vow— Courage, and Hope, and Constancy, Enduring Faith and Honour high, And all that should inspire the loyal breast, 960 Which with its holy sign, approving Heaven has blest. i( It comes! th' auspicious hour I hail! Once more upon the sparkling brine We launch our barks for Palestine, And spread the golden Lions to the gale; Expectant angels, even now, Watch from proud Carmel's blossom 'd bjçow; Weep, weep, ye faithless! smile, ye faithfiil train! Sad Sion, lift thy head, thou shalt be. Queen again î
íť Thou azure badge, not soon to fade, 970 Ev'n from this night thy glories rise! Proud as those palms that to the skies In the pure light their giant foliage spread; Eternal as those hills of snow Or yon vast ocean's sullen flow, Thou shalt be Virtue's highest meed, and worn 'Mid undiscover'd worlds, and nations yet unborn. ίζ Nor does fallacious Hope inspire; Nor is it daring Pride that sings— A Cherub's plume has swept the strings, 980 And nobler numbers warble from the lyre. More clear yon vivid orb on high Moves slowly thro' the purple sky, In whose dark realm the stars assembling bright, Mock Europe's dusky heav'n, her pale and cloudy night " О Тнои, who gav'st those orbs to roll! If where for Man a Saviour bled, Diviner, purer light, they shed, Now pour the living lustre through the soul! Mean as we are, but breathing dust, 990 Exalt our hope, revive our trust, Oh! guide our swords—at least accord the prayer To reach the sacred shore, and fall or triumph there!"
Low to the earth was bowed each noble head, Each fervent vow in solemn silence paid; Departing then they sink in peaceful sleep, Till morn should rouse to plough the foaming deep.,END OF BOOK III,,VOL. I,,к

CŒUR DE LION.,BOOK IV.,THE MEDIAN FIRE. Cautious and calm, meanwhile the Soldan views The hostile army, and his own renews. From Egypt's strand (his delegated reign) He summons Adel to the Syrian plain, And while his brother ploughs the watery way, His numerous bands disposed in long array; Warriors of every race, and every soil, Sons of the mount, the desert, and the isle; From Cashmere's flowery vales to Nubia's sand, From Mocha's sultry coast to Zamarcand. 10 к 3
The half-clad Ethiop wields his dreadful flail, The Syrian clasps his imbricated mail; The blue-eyed Georgian from his mountain lair Hurls with Circassia's tribe his slender spear; The Bedouin comes, with keen and restless eye, Spare sineţvy form, and turban's crimson dye, Whose home is wheresoe'er his tent may rise, Or the red banner of his chieftain flies; Whose only treasure is his faithful steed, His patient camel, and his sure jerreed; 20 Inured to pain, he mocks the burning scar, For want and thirsc have keener stings than war.* The Persian, cradled in a happier clime, Of lighter hue, and stature more sublime, Whose mighty limbs bright flowing silks enfold, Whose sabre shines with gems, whose robe with gold; Mahommed's interdicted cup he drains, And Shiraz' vine flows purple in his veins. Full in the front of war he loves to wield His glittering steel, and thunders to the field. 30 The Turk, not yet to opiate drugs a prey. In stupor lost, and dreaming life away; Proud of that strength which Persia's lion fled, And Rome's degenerate eagles learn'd to dread. b
And Tartar tribes, 'hose names not oft are heard Beyond those valleys where their steeds are rear'd; They fight, they bleed, yet History shuts her page, Nor their fierce broils our Western thoughts engage More than those ants, whose busy nations toil, And war, and die, beneath the quiet soil. 40 Save when some mightier Khan unsheaths the sword, O'er wondering Asia pours his barbarous horde, Bows half the East beneath his iron reign, Flames like a meteor, flames, and fades again. But first in rank, in courage and in grace, To combat train'd, and cull'd from every race, In radiant yellow clad, the Mamlukes shine, The household slaves, the guard of Saladine.* Would you their parents or their home inquire? He was their home, their country, and their sire ,· 50 In arms resembling sheath'd, in conflict known By the rich vest or pictur'd shield alone: Yet some were there, or they their sires belie, Whose eyes first open'd on a milder sky, Perchance were born the heirs of wealth and fame, And lisp'd with infant tongues a Saviour's name.,к 4
Perfidious Venice! guard thy jealous reign, Chase each presumptuous rival from the main; Chain thy sad captive« to the gilded oar; Be misery theirs, but on a Christian shore. 60 Sell not to impious hands the wretched slave,* Nor let thy hatred reach beyond the grave. In robes that with no splendid jewels shone, The placid Soldan fill'd his simple throne. 0 Five youthful chiefs, and each a monarch's heir, Their vassal aid to Asia's ruler bear: Prince of Aleppo, ardent Ghazi stands; Zeineddin, leader of Arbelia's bands; Osman from eastern Omar's rocky isle, And Zenghi, lord of Sandjar's burning soil; 70 And Aladin, whom youth's warm hopes inspire,* 1 (Seiffeddin's glory), joins his raptur'd sire; His sire, who sees his early honours bloom, And dreams of conquest and of power to come;
When Mosul shall no more to Syria bow, But claim that tribute which she renders now. Yet hopes like these he hid, while still the youth The gen'rous Soldan serv'd with Zealand truth; And like the infant bird, who sees in air Its parent soar, and longs her flight to share, 80 In fight he watch'd him, learn'd from him to reign, And loved the greatness he aspired to gain. While near the throne each princely leader stands, In radiant columns pass their subject bands; Slow move their steeds, thick clouds of dust arise, And " Alia Acbar" echoes to the skies! His force repair'd, the Soldan on the plain Provokes the battle, but provokes in vain; Four rising suns the marshall'd ranks beheld, And night reluctant to their tents compell'd. 90 He rides round Turon's adverse camp—he calls The Franks to war—they stir not from the walls! With growing numbers rich, with conquest warm, What breeds this sudden fear, or feign'd alarm? But lo! those towers—such towers has story told 'Gainst Sion's ramparts Godfrey rear'd of old— Such vast machines can human force repeli? Or Acre stand their shock—when Sion fell?
Three days wear on —while higher yet and higher, Far o'er the wall those lofty towers aspire; 100 The axe and hammer ring with ceaseless sound, And Carmel's rocks th' appalling din rebound. For one vast blow the hosts of Christ prepare, And knightly hands the glorious labour share. A fourth bright morning dawns—the gates unfold, On levers rais'd, on wheels unnumber'd roll'd, And thickly hemm'd by ranks of chosen powers, The labouring steers drag on the ponderous towers f With all those pests of war, the mining Sow, The Cat which clings, and guards the troops below,* Petraria, Catapult, and Mangoneil, For Heaven employed though first devis'd in Hell. The clarions bray, while borne in state along Before the noblest of the noble throng, The Oriflamme in sanguine splendour flew, } And to the morning sun Montigny threw ъ- The royal lilies on their field of blue. J Last mov'd that banner, victory J s holy sign, The sacred portrait, traced by hands divine, Where shone the saint, who not less good than brave, To shivering want his own rich mantle gave j f * " Great names, but hard in verse tű stand,"
Though boiling pitch, and darts, and sheets of flame Pour on their heads in many a scorching stream, With earth, with stones collected from the plain, With ghastly bodies of the gasping slain, The Christians heap the moat—vast shields on high Protect their ranks,' an iron panoply. Th' observant Soldan, at their force dismay'd, Draws forth his host, and flies to Acre's aid; But Otho leads his brave Burgundiam on, 130 The Red Cross Knights, and Brethren of St. John, And joined by Leopold, in firm array, Compel the conflict, and obstruct his way. The moat is fill'd—beneath the torturing goad Again the steers urge on their groaning load: O'er the rough plain slow moves each giant weight; They reach the walls, and match those walls in height. Three stages rear'd, the Ram with ceaseless blow And brazen head, assaults the town below; Thick bales of wool in vain its fury break, 140 The stones are crumbled, and the ramparts shake; Midway the rapid sling impelis the stone, And javelins pour, and flaming darts are thrown. With maces arm'd, an hundred knights aloof Securely fight beneath the solid roof.
Where Satan's fort the northern shore commands, 'Gainst bold Champagne great Aboul Hagia stands; While Alberic and brave Montmorency pour Where Mestoc guards the Patriarch's western tower; Th' Accursed fortress in the midst ascends: 150 There Philip storms, and Karacous defends, There mutual valour wakes the fiercest strife, And the eold thirsty steel drinks deep of life. High o'er his peers th' intrepid monarch stands, And pain and death show'r dreadful from his hands; While Karacous beholds where'er they fly The fearful tremble, and the valiant die. <ť Ye sons of Islam, yield not thus!" he cried; C( Those threat'ning towers will vanish when defied. Behold this urn, this urn of liquid flame, 160 Which steel resists not, nor can ocean tame; When on their heads the fiery storm shall burst, Well may they call this fatal tower " Accurst." Accurst as when (for so their legends tell) It forged the coin through which their Prophet fell.* All ye, whose trust in Alia rests alone, All ye, whose music is a Christian groan,
Behold, the vengeance from my hands I pour, Behold, themselves, their castles are no more!" Vaunting he spoke, while eager to devour, I70 The lambent flames run swift along the tower; The Moslems bend to hail th' expected fire, But lo! they fade, they flicker, and expire. While high to Heaven the Christian shouts are heard, Confused, astonish'd, they beheld and fear'd. Again, again, their boasted fires they try; Again, again, those fires innocuous die j The tempered beams the liquid flame repel, And other arts oppose the «arts of Hell. When from the саь.'^ now its drawbridge falls, 180 Lets down its iron hooks, and grasps the walls. The Franks press on, and none their rage oppose, Hope nerves their arms, and terror chills their foes. When Karacous: " Shall yon red banner wave On Acre's height? shall Magic daunt the brave î Mahommed sees, and but permits their power Till yon bright sun unfold the destined hour. Eternal torments wait the wretch that flies; But for the brave, his death is paradise!" He spoke—his troops again around him close, 190 And to their tower drive back the rising foes j
Their bucklers lock'd present an iron wall, And ranks behind succeed to those that fall. But in their triumph, unobserved below, The Ram relentless urged the fatal blow: The tottering height a fruitless warning gave, One moment, and its ruins are their grave; Down, down, in silent state the weight descends, Falls with loud crash, earth shakes, and smoke ascends. In feeble moans it drowns their dying cry!— 200 But Karacous, who clung unhurt on high, Springs to the breach—the Gallic King defies, And walls and warriors to the town supplies. Curved like the moon, he waves his Syrian blade, While Philip's hand his keen francisque displayed; 5 Behind, with rage his bold Ribaldi flame- But Karacous, though short his awkward frame, (For Nature form'd him in some wayward hour Of limbs misshapen, but gigantic power);* Though in his scarf the bristling lances shine "2\0 Thick as the quills on " fretful porcupine," Or the keen arrows of the polar frost, Shakes off the dreadful hail, and stems an host;
While like some mountam peak he braves the storm, The remnant of his train behind him form; Careless of death, again in fight they close, And hand to hand, and steel to steel oppose. On either side, where Philip's warriors led The fierce assault, alike the battle bled: The batterM walls the dreadful Ram attest; 220 Death stalks abroad, and stills the brave to rest. While these for glory and for Heaven contend, And those their country and their homes defend j Nor mark'd they how the sands of time had run, Till darkness follow'd on the sinking sun; The Christians then unwilling quit the fray, And slowly drag their huge machines away. Nor was the fight with less of fury waged, Where to the left, with Saladine engaged, The Templars, raging at their late defeat, 230 Back to their tents the astonish'd Arabs beat. Rinaldo, now by vote their leader made, Appeas'd with ample offerings Eudon-'s shade, While for disabled Conrad's every wound, The Austrian stretch'd a Moslem on the ground.
James of Avesnes, and Otho, side by side, O'er heaps of slain like vengeful angels ride; Zeineddin, Osman, Aladin, in vain With knightly gore their virgin sabres stain, Condemn'd to see their friends around them die, 240 And by the flying throngs compell'd to fly. But Saladme, who feels a leader's cares, Hastes o'er the field, and every danger dares, Careless his life from showering darts to save, That seem'd respectful of a breast so brave. At first he strives to change the doubtful field, Then bows to fate, and but contends to shield; Yet oft to Heaven he turns th' upbraiding eye, And calls the lingering darkness from the sky, Rejoiced when night with all her shadows came, 250 To save his warriors, or conceal their shame. Deep in his tent, remote from every eye, Cast on the ground in breathless agony, He loathes his food, he seeks his grief to hide, Nor dare his sons approach their father's side; Deaf to affection's voice, to pity's tone He moves not, speaks not, lives to pain alone. h
'Tis night's chill noon, yet rest his bosom flies— Still in his tent, exhausted, pale, he lies; He starts, he groans, cold dews suffuse his frame, 260 And hoarse and low his painful accents came. iC О Thou, to spread whose glory I resign Health, peace, whate'er of earthly good were mine, Thou who hast forced on my reluctant brow The plumes of empire, wilt thou leave me now? Oh! had 1 All's strength, or Kaled's sword, 1 No morn from rest should rouse that race abhorr'd— Yet thou permitt'st their triumph!—Thou hast arm'd Their hands with terror, and their engines charm'd! Twice twenty seasons cold nor burning heat 270 Have seen me cast the slippers from my feet, If e'er when thy black banner brav'd the wind, I shrunk in luxury and in sloth behind, Or e'en in fight forgot the hour of prayer. Let Acre fall, I merit not thy care; But if in thee I place unbroken trust, Sleeps Islam's Prophet?—Is her God unjust?" With entrance unannounc'd, abrupt and rude, Before the Chief a turban'd stranger stood;,VOL. I.,L
Dark were his giant limbs, and on his face 280} A mass of evil thoughts had left their trace, > Yet could not quench a wild and awful grace. j Rough, deep and loud, his voice attention bound, Yet sweetness blended in its sternest sound; His presence sunk the heart with sudden chill,— Not shunn'd, though dreaded, and respected still. " Fear is for vulgar souls, but not for thine, Rise, son of Ayoub! conquering Saladine 1 Can a slight breeze thus shake a soul so great? And is it not thy creed, that all is fate? 2'. 'Mid those lone sands, ere sprung thy race of clay, Where prostrate Genii hymn'd the living ray, In later days where many a festive throng And royal pageant led the hours along; Where Iran's dark-eyed daughters wont to sing, While scattering roses of the earliest spring, And Zoroaster's priests in vesture white With solemn music hail'd the orient light; And magic fountains of self-kindled flame Burst from the earth in many a burning stream: 300 There, 'mid her roofless columns, Istakar, True to her God, still meets his beam afar;
Still her lone terraces gleam o'er the waste, Sublimely sad, and speak of ages past. And still that wond'rous fount's mysterious blaze Pours its full tribute of eternal praise. Know, mighty Prince, the mortal who shall dare To dwell in solitude and silence there, What time the naptha's pale and livid light Burns with more splendour through the moonless night, And, slaves of fire, the mighty Genii lave Their horrid bulk amid the burning wave, May view their uncouth orgies, and compel From their slow utterance many a potent spell: Command the wealth in caves of ocean barr'd, That flames encircle and that dragons guard ', Those wond'rous apples, poison half, half sweet, v And basilisks, whose glance 'tis death to meet 3 The Carbuncle that burns, self-pois'd in air, And Talismans, that e'en the Demons fear, 320 And jewels precious as the vase long hid, His Genii workmen brought to Giamschid, 1 ' Whose azure depths were privileg'd to shine With the first beverage of the purple vine;,L 2
While all around the (e charming poison" quaflTd, The Monarch drain'd the blushing bovvl, and laugh'd, (( Prince, not less wond'rous is the vase I bear; A wave from that mysterious fount is there. Those Christian towers that mock at other fire, Once touch'd by this, shall like a dream expire." 330 He spoke, but doubtful still the Soldan stands, And from the vase averts his pious hands. " I hate the Christians—live but for their bane, But Alla's curse is breath'd on arts profane. Unhallow'd hands that turquoise vase have wrought, From springs unblest that burning stream is brought." " Fool!" cried the stranger, while his eyeballs glare With rage that quench'd each gleam of sweetness there, " Think'st thou that human voice at Istakar Hath told thy loss, or borne me thence so far, 340 Ere the gold vessel in thine Imaum's tower Thrice emptied, thrice hath told the changing hour?* Prince, know me for Demroosh, and know me one Of those bright spirits that adore the sun, Who, but thy Prophet bids, would rather see Thy race destroyed, than waste one spell on thee."
He spoke, and his dilated form became A vast terrific mass of whirling flame; Still as it grew, his features shrunk from sight, And vanish'd in a pyramid of light. 1 350 The Soldan clapp'd his hands, th' attendants ran, And the loud trumpet calls the full Divan. Wond'ring the Princes came, and find their Lord To health, to all his mighty self restored. <r Shake off this cloud of griefj my sons," he cries, e< Nor weep for those that wake in Paradise. Behold the sacred pledge of conquest given, The gracious promise of approving Heaven; Not framed by man, or brought by mortal powers, It holds destruction to the Christian towers. 364) Oh! who but courts th* emprize, the glory rare, 1 " Λ Even through yon camp to Karacous to bear ν Our Acre's safety, and her foe's despair?" ι His cheerful words heroic ardour shed, All court the honour, nor the danger dread; When from the throng the Prince of Mosul burst, In years the youngest, but in zeal the first; While modesty with hope impetuous blends, Glows in his speech, and on his cheek contends. L 3
" Not for my own, but for my falher'b fame, 370 Let Asia's ruler grant his servant's claim; Not yet on me her smile has glory shed, Or stoop'd her purple pinions on my head: While Chiefs are round, so circled with her ray«, This single deed were lost amid the blaze. Be mine the hazard, give my youth a right To wage thy wars, their fellows in the fight." Though grave his mood, the generous Soldan smiled, " Seitfeddin hear, and glory iu thy child! Yet to thy realms, as to his valour just, 380 1 not alone the daring warrior trust; Go thou, Moheddin! prove how high ï rate His budding worth, who give him such a mate." They doff their robes—the armour that he tore From a stout German, brave Moheddin wore; While Aladin a Spaniard's mail assumes,, And quits the turban for the nodding plumes; His scymitar, that knew its youthful lord, Alone he chang'd not for th' Iberian sword, But o'er the turquoise vase with ι ¿verenee threw 390 His scarf', adorn'd with man) a glowing hue. Clean -'d with ablutions meet, with silent speed, in circuit large they urge each foaming bleed.
Their clattering hoofs, while yet they skirt the plain, Unheard amid the murmurs of the main. 'Twas dark—and scarce the watch-fires' feeble gleam Reveal'd the winding Belus' placid stream, Whose upward course they trace, and flinging now Their Íengthen'd reins across an alder's bough, On foot they pass the bridge*—before them frown'd The leaguer'd town, and danger hems them round, For, lest their foes some nightly succour gain, The Christians here a chosen guard maintain; Yet now their fires arc dim, for each had quaff d To Philip's health, till slumber check'd the draught. Rous'd by the tread, they raised their eye* with pain, Saw Christian armour gleam, and slept again. Two hostile rows of drowsy guards are pass'd, The anxious Saracens approach the last, Where one more wakeful than his comrades stood, 410 To route the dying fire with piles of wood; Then starts, as, by the springing blaze confest, Shone Aladm'b rich mail, and eagle crest. ic St. James preserve us! Lopez, sce'st thou there My master's ghost! by Heaven I *aw him fair.,L 1
Nay mock me not, shake oft* this rebel bleep, He comes to blame the careless watch we keep." But pierced by Aladin, he owns too late A lh ing arm, and hinks beside his mate. " The foe! the treacherous foe \" aloud he cries, 420 Waves faintly his expiring brand, and dies. Haste, Prince, secure thy charge i for all around The armed Franks spring furious from the ground, Close on Moheddin, scan hib sn arthy brow, And through the thin disguise the Moslem know. Oh, shall he leave him vainly to contend, His charge endanger, or desert his friend? 'Tis Nature's voice prevails; his left arm prest The precious cup still closer to his breast, While with his right the thickening ranks he cleaves, And these of limbs, and those of life bereaves. He sees Moheddin falter in the strife, And swords ignoble threat his valued life; By danger's self inspired, he dares to raise Its azure cover from the mystic vase, Blazed like a beacon light that wond' rous fire! Confus'd, appall'd, the trembling crowds retire. " Speed!" cried the Prince. He closed the cup again, And sprang through flying пшпЬегь to the main.
" See, see, my friend! kind Alia lends the bark, 440 Our foes are scattered, and the night is dark." Screen'd by a rock, not then in story known, But call'd in after years " the English stone,"" With desperate strength they push her from the shore, Unfurl the canvas, and employ the oar, And unmolested reach the ancient fort, Which, rais'd 'mid chafing seas, protects the port. Moheddin now his purposed signal tries, "4 A ball of light, which high in ether flies, > Breaks into stars, and fades amid the skies. 450 j The summon'd guard his well-known voice delights, And quells the fear his Christian mail excites. To Karacous, who through the weary night Still toil'd, expectant of the morning fight, The envoys give the fatal vase, and then Guide their light galiot o'er the deep agen. The dawn to Acre's shores that vessel brought, With corn and wine for Genoa's pilgrims fraught, And when young Aladin its flag unroll'd Deep blush'd the Cross amid a lake of gold. 460 With smiles he spoke, " may Alia now dispose Our friends to fly—we need not fear our toes.
But near those rocks, Moheddin, dost thou mark How the rough surges toss a founder'd bark? And lo! some wretch—I see his signal wave—- Clings to the relic—let us haste to save!" He plung'd amid the deep, and snatch'd from fate A Knight, just sinking with his armour's weight. One arm sustain'd the load, one stemm'd the tide, Till safe at last, he mounts the vessel's side, 470 And aids Moheddin, active to reclaim The life yet lingering in the senseless frame. They raise his helm, and gaze an instant there ^ On a pale face, for manly strength too fair, > And dripping Jocks of long and sable hair; y At length his eyes unclose—that flag alarms Returning sense, and starting from their arms, While o'er his livid cheek the crimson broke, And his weak frame with frenzied terror shook: " Oh, cruel chance! oh, luckless hour!" he cried, 480 " And ye unblest, that snatch'd me from the tide! That Cross, those helms, your Christian lineage shew, And should be dear, for I am Christian too; Yet lead me not to Philip's camp, for there Are eyes whose gaze my brain would burst to bear.
Такс me to Saladine, or I again Will seek that ocean whence yc snatch'd in vain." C( Unhappy Knight! may all thy sorrows fade Like this false fear," his young preserver said. " What, though these arms our Eastern race belie, 490 See, as the purple sunrise paints the sky, 1 turn to Mecca's holy shrine, and lave My hands obedient in the cleansing wave. Behold a Chief long wont in arms to shine, The Christian scourge, the friend of Saladine; Thy western climes have heard Moheddin's name."— " Andthine brave youth?"—"As yet unknown to fame, The humble Aladin begins but now To seek those wreaths that grace the warrior's brow." They pass the Christian lines, and row to land, 500 Where the stout Moslems guard the jealous strand. Who soon Moheddin's swarthy features know, And hail a comrade, where they fear'd a foe. Still in his hall, and anxious for their fate, Amid his chiefs the watchful Soldan sate; Wliiie Mosul's King, whose wily heart confest A parent's fears, the keener pang supprest. But when the warriors came, with triumph crown'd, When Aladin springs forward with a bound,
Proceeds th' adventures of the night to shew 510 And half, in haste, forgets th' obeisance due; Then, as it needs his own success to speak, Finds his words fail, and hides his glowing cheek. The generous King his youthful hero clasp'd, His conscious hand the happy father grasp'd; And, as the Monarch's praise delighted flows, With wary tongue his cold applause bestows, Fearful too bright his dangerous fame might shine. Yet ill he read the heart of Saladine; Who, while no guilt disturb'd his stable throne, 520 Could prize his vassal's glory as his own. Moheddin now, his graver mission sped, To Saladine the rescued stranger led; Slight wes his stature, but his noble mien Shew'd one familiar with such courtly scene. " W hence, stranger, dost thou come, and whatdesign? What hopes a Christian Knight from Saladine?" ťí From realms as distant as the orient main Whence springs the sun, to where he sets again, í come, in virtue's specious name betray'd, 530 Against my Christian foes to seek thine aid. Yet mine no vulgar grief—to thee alone, And those that ba\'d me, let its source bc shewn."
He paus'd—th' assenting Soldan wav'd his hand, And from the tent retired th' obedient band. His cuirass now the stranger knight unbrac'd, A knight no more—the woman stood confest. f( Prince, if your Prophet, as 'tis said, have driven Our weaker sex from his voluptuous heaven, Or hut assign' d us there the tasks he gives 540 To poor imprison'd beauty, while she lives, How strange, how monstrous, must this sight appear, A royal virgin clad in armour here! Yet if distress a warrior's pity claim, That pity give, and listen ere you blame. Where the calm Seine a richer verdure lave«, And circles Paris with its winding waves, How bright my life's deceitful morning shone, A nation's pride, and sister to the throne! Yet to one brighter dream would fancy cling, 550 My spousal contract with the English King. Alas! how ill our genuine good wc know, What seem'd a blessing, prov'd my heaviest woe. While Richard's absence 1 with tearb endured, His roving gaze an artful maid allur'd; New vows he form'd, nor thus content, to hide His fickle heart, my virgin fame belied;
Oh í cruel blow í wa-î't not enough to gain My fond confiding love, and then disdain? Why crush that flower so fragile and so fair, 560 To woman vital as the viewless air That nourishes unfelt, but whose sweet breath, Denied or tainted, is disease and death. Vet Averse remains: my brother, once so kind, With him in bonds of policy combin'd, In silence hears the tale, ah! wretched change! And sees his sister weep, nor wreaks revenge. Then blame not that I thus my sex disguise, And seek myself the justice he denies; Who else must live of lying tongues the sport, 5/0 Rude as those waves that wreck'd me at your port. For this I sought thy camp, О Prince! and bring Hate deep as thine to England's perjured King. I fight, to force denial from his tongue, Or bid his kinder sword complete the wrong: Let me till then forget my injured name, And in Zorayda hide Alalia's shame." " Tis strange!" the Prince rejoin'd— tc your knights declare Their vow, their glory, to defend the fair r Is innocence aspers'd, and shall not France, 580 Or generous England, yield her cause a lance?
Enough—I greet thee, daughter of the West! And fear no treachery from a royal guest. I meet thy frankness with as frank a heart, Stay while thou wilt, and when thou wilt, depart. Yet, for my sake, this robe of state assume, And grace thy helmet with this sanguine plume, And only to this faithful pair be known What gentle bosom guards their monarch's throne." But Aladin, while she her plaint preferr'd, 590 Lived in her looks, and hung on every word; Wont, 'mid his harem's cool sequester'd bowers With beauty's smile to cheat the idle hours, Contending nymphs and rival charms compare, And own how hard to chuse where all were fair; To scorn, even while he felt, the petty wiles That drest each eye in light, each cheek in smiles; Complain of short-lived pangs he scarcely knew, Speak as their slave, yet as their master woo— He, nurst in climes where beauty, ripe too soon, 600 Flowers in the dawn, and fades before the noon, Dreamt not of that high charm, that grace refined, When beams through each fine form th'etherial mind · That beauty, which in gentleness sublime Awes yet allures, nor dreads the touch of time;
That urges man to more than human deeds, For which the poet sings, the warrior bleeds; And wins no favourite of an hour, but one Still more endear'd when rosy youth is gone. Perchance not all these charms Alasia knew, 610 But all were her's to his enchanted view; Her wrongs he felt, nor question'd whence it came, That Philip, nay that Europe slights her fame; If from her eye intemperate anger broke, In that keen glance indignant virtue spoke; True she was Christian, yet 'gainst Christians fought, And spurn'd their worship whom as friends she sought; But love such bars despised—did he require His Persian nymphs to slight their God of fire; Nay he had watch'd, to see the hinna shine 620 4 Through her long fingers, when some maid divine > Her flowery muntras told at Brahma's shrine,* j True she had barter'd for the helmet's pride ^ Her rank and virgin robes—but he might guide v Her steed in war, and combat by her side; J And (pleased to prove that chivalry was known Not to the youth of western climes alone)
When at her feet he knelt, and sued the right \ To wear her colours, and be called her knight, Ъ- Her scarf rewards the ardent proselyte. 630^ Then to her tent the royal maid retires, To seek that rest her weary frame requires; While he, by hope and love sustain'd, again Springs to the armies forming on the plain. Oh, fatal night! oh, fatal gift of fire! And thou, Alasia! scarce a gift less dire! The Christians arm, and flush'd with hope and joy, Crowd to the plain, and speak of triumph nigh: Ah, wretched, if they knew their wretched doom, But Heaven in mercy shrouds the ill to come. 640 The Templars, prompt the conflict to renew, O'er their black mail their snowy surcoats threw; Awful, beneath their open helms appear'd The dark stern visage, and the manly beard.* Half black, half white, their banner tann'd the air, And barded steeds their honour'd burthen bear. Nor with less state sage Ermengard leads on, In scarlet robed, the warriors of St. John:,VOL. ι.,M
In life's gay morning from the world he fled To tend the outcast leper's loathsome bed; 650 Nor less maintained his Saviour's cause in fight, And the White Cross adorned no braver knight.* His eye was keen, his features pale and spare, And the rough casque had thinn'd his silver hair; Yet strong must be his horse, and firm his seat, Who dared that chief in battle-shock to meet. 0 Fill'd with like hope, with like desire of fame, On their fleet steeds the flower of Asia came, By Omar led, who now to strength restored, Waves with redoubled hate his eager sword. 660 On either side they strive, they bleed, nor yield One foot of ground, and equal seem'd the field, Till Mosul's Prince, who through that desperate day Seem'd more than mortal, where the fiercest fray Raged round Rinaldo, on the hero flies, And, warm with youth, to deadly fight defies; Nor long they fought, for from the saddle tost, Again the Templars mourn their leader кь\ The Christians yield—brave Ermengard in vain Would save the living, and protect the slain; 670
His knights in vain their rivalry forego, They miss the arm of wounded Conrad now, And he still foremost in the dangerous fight, Oh, whither is he fled, the Emerald Knight? And slighted Geoffrey, ever in the van, And he, though less a warrior, Lusignan, Whose holy standard was a resting place Where rallying hope might turn, and brave disgrace? While o'er his mail the priestly surplice shone, Hubert, the saintly Hubert, fights alone; 680 Alike prepared to act or to endure, Nor death had terrors for a soul so pure; Serene in good or ill, with equal eyes He look'd on both, who look'd beyond the skies. Where'er the Moslems most deform'd the field, Where death staik'd fiercest, there was Hubert's jshield; An arm less strong, a spirit less subdued, Had dyed the thirsty sword more deep in blood; But in that awful moment, truly brave, He sought not praise, his triumph was to save. 690 Meanwhile the King, confiding in his power, Storms from his wooden fort th' "AccursedTower;" While in the second castle A Iberic falls With rage rekindled on the ** Patriarch's" walls, m 2
And heav'd with patient labour from the shore, The third vast pile two sturdy galleys bore. With Austria's Duke the gallant Flemings join, Pisa and Genoa swell the frowning line; (Who with the Adriatic Queen contest Her ocean crown, and commerce of the west). 700 In twenty chosen barks, with naval state, They seek that tower Moheddin sought so late; The " Tower of Sacrifice," by Pagan doom, Where bled to Jove the votive hecatomb; Built on a rock, amid the waves it stands, Protects the mole, the shelter'd port commands. 1 " First Alberic wakes the war—an arrowy shower Dr wcs its brave guardians from the Patriarch's tower; He calls his warriors, lets the drawbridge down, Springs to the wall, and rushes through the town.710 The Moslems fly! he heaps the streets with slain, Nor looks behind, nor chides his lingering train. Rous'd by the clamour, Aralchais came;— Though sprung from Karacous, his sinewy frame Had more than manly bulk, but not a soul Which, like his sire's, could half a realm control; Boastful as brave, exulting in his force, Greedy of spoil, and stranger to remorse.
(i Turn, Christian, turn!" he said, "if aught thou seek, Save vulgar foes, the timid and the weak, 720 Turn! for my sword the combat can compel; Methinks those costly arms would suit me well." They met, and blows resound. The youth in height And strength excell'd; in skill the generous knight. So long they fought, and each so well withstood His rival's rage, that neither yet subdued, But wearied both, by mutual wish awhile Suspend the conflict, and repose from toil. 'Twas where a temple rose to him who trod The Syrian wastes, the herald of his God; /30 The sculptor's art his wond'rous story shew'd, The desert rocks, and Jordan's sacred flood; While sever'd heads, in grim and ghastly row Record his death, and Herod's impious vow. 4 So high the spot that thence their eyes command The town beneath, the ocean and the land. But what the sight that both confounds } and why Does one with terror shout, and one with joy? Three pyramids of flame, that rolling dun Their murky vapours, hide the noonday sun -, 7^0 Those clouds of smoke, those sanguine fires, too well To Alberic's heart their fatal secret tell; m 3
Benumb'd he stands, as by some wizard's charm, Nor hears the Moslem call, nor sees him arm. Weak.:? a lamb before his murderous foe, He lifts no shield—his heart receives the blow. Fierce Aralchaïs tore his mail away, And left his corpse to prowling dogs a prey· Nor had his warriors, in his hour of need, Thus left their valiant chief alone to bleed, 750 But Karacous, as in his glorious track They strove to gain the walls, compell'd them back. Soon o'er the crumbling battlement he hung, And from his vase the fatal naptha flung; O'er burning wood, o'er shrieking warriors plays With suffocating stench, the quenchless blaze j Nor acids here nor temper'd hides avail, Nor cooling water, nor impervious mail; All flame alike, men, weapons, engines, all Catch the blue fire, and share the general fall. 760 The Count of Blois, the lord of fair Champagne, And Joinville, by his King belov'd in vain, Sink in th' inglorious heap, a loss more dear Than all the engines years of toil could rear. Still Philip fought, and conquest crown'd his arms With easy wreaths, when now a shriek alarms;
Turning, he sees the magic fires devour The Christian boast, th' invulnerable tower; He sees th' exulting Emir, who displays His own intended fate, the flaming vase. 770 *' To earth, to earth!" he cried, and happy they Whose flying feet were swiftest to obey; Already to the sky the blaze aspires, And the proud castle sinks in lurid fires. Last of the band the young Antonio came, His crested helmet caught the magic flame,— He writhes in agony, his piercing cries Λ Drown even the Moslem shout, till soon he lies V A heap of dust: his spirit seeks the skies. y It chanced a spear that Montmorency cast 780 Flew through the flames and kindled as it past, It fixed its point in Aboul Hagia's breast, Vainly he tore it from his glowing vest, He burns, to earth his failing limbs descend, His scatter'd ashes with Antonio's blend. Meanwhile the Austrian, in his floating tower, Leads to the fierce assault his naval power; The fort was slightly mann'd, and ill prepared, No arm of prowess animates the guard m 4
What though a random spear had pierced his side/ He mounts aloft, nor heeds the sanguine tide. Where on the ramparts warlike engines stood With flaming torch he fires the arid wood; His followers scale the Avail«, and blazing brands Shed fire at once from fifty valiant hands; The Saracens retreat, the Christian host O'er the hot embers mounts, and wins the^post, While raised in triumph on the fading fire«;, 'Mid wreaths of smoke the conquering Cross aspires. But fell Demroosh, of all that race accurst 800 Thai met on Carmel, loathsomest and worst, Unseen was near. With dire combustion fraught, A small light bark the artful Pisans brought; But not to man the coming hour is known, Their foes destruction meant, it proves their own. The watchful fiend on that ill-omen'd bark Blows from the burning fort a floating spark. Swift as light straw, or Autumn's wither'd leaves, Her fatal freight the rapid ill receives: She flames, nor flames alone, her rockets cast 810 On every side have lighted many a mast, Warriors to steel inur 'd, in conflict brave, Shriek at the fire, and shudder at the wave.
In vaîn their eager hands unfurl the sails, The canvas kindles as they catch the gales; In vain they ply the oar, the burning wood Drops from their grasp, and chafes the hissing flood. Few Avere the barks their wretched crew that bore Through flood and fire, to die by steel on shore. Nor ends the havoc here, on meteor wings 820 From the calm sea th' exploding fireship springs, And like some vast volcano, sends on high Its flaming entrails to pollute the sky. The waters foam and swell, the thunder's roar Shakes the still air, an earthquake rocks the shore: Yet calm and solemn as the mountain's brow In the clear moon, when tempests rage below, Floats the proud castle, and that burning storm But clothed in glory what it could not harm; Till the dire fiend, who lights th' accursed dart, 830 Even in the penal flame that wraps his heart, Strikes its broad base, the lambent volumes soar,— The last, the proudest castle is no more. Stern on the hostile fort the Austrian stands, And owns the malice of infernal hands. Islam revives, his few brave friends maintain Th' unequal fight, but mingle with the slain:
foce n And one who marked him wounded, ¡>pcnt \\ith toil. Thought at light cost to win the princely «poil; But in his groin the Austrian drove the wound, 840 Then spurn'd the falling wretch, and glancing round A withering look, he plunged amid the main, And rose, though cumber'd withhU arms, again. Though pour'd a crimson current from his side, With strenuous arms he beat the foaming tide, And reach'd the shore; but peace nor rest was there, All was confusion, carnage, and despair. To their strong camp the hunted Christians fly, And thank the care that rais'd its walls so high f While on their rear the Moslems pres«, to gain 850 That la«t defence, and make its shelter vain. Before the open gate the Count of Bar, A new Achilles, singly bears the war; Like some vast elephant, whose native mail His winged foes with puny rage assail, He stood; the spears that bristled in his vest He sent more deeply to their owner's breast, And as the victims thickened round, he rose Still more terrific on his gasping foes. Screen'd by his mighty arm, the Christians haste 860 To their calm tents, and bless him as they past.
Ala*! that strength u hieb all the battle bore, Which slew an hundred foes and sought for more, That mail *o finely л\ rought and knit so well, Were *v*i oak as reed^ before tlie powers of hell. The conquering troop* of Saladine to aid Now Karacous the eager sail) led, While borne triumphant in the turquois vase Of fire accurst a fatal remnant plays: That fatal drop, with fur\ hurl'd from far, 870 I Strike« on his lifted sword the Count of Bar; He shake* it from his gra*p, but shakes in vain, It clings suspended by too strong a chain; His arm already feeb th' ascending flame, And dreadful tortures spread through all hi* frame. Enraged, to earth he cast his ponderous shield, And snatch'd a spear, the last he e'er shall wield: " Take that, misshapen wretch! and learn, if still My better arm were faithful to my will, Soon should thy soul regain its native hell, 880 And feel those torments thou canst give so well." He spoke—his spear the Emir's shoulder tore, And long that wound shall Karacous deplore. Then with one shrill, one final shriek of pain, He fell expiring on the mound of slain,
While spreading o'er the whole, that wondrous fire Blends all his victims in one funeral pyre. 1 Yet even in death his weeping friends he saved, And aw'd that foe his living arm had braved. That mighty blaze, extending o'er the plain, 890 Drives from th' assaulted camp the impious train. Secure at length the ponderous valves they close, And weep their loss, and from their toils repose.

CŒUR DE LION. BOOK V.,THE ARRIVAL OF RICHARD IN PALESTINE. Within the camp confusion reign'd, and shame, Resentment, clamour, grief and mutual blame: But man is blind; no warning, no remorse, Arrests the wicked in his headlong course. The Austrian hastes where still in regal pride, Sate reckless Isabelle by Conrad's side, And cool'd his gashes with that herb renown'd, \ That erst by Belus great Alcides found,* > What time the dying hydra gave the wound. j
Scarce patient of the Leech's short delay, 10 Propt on his sword, he urged his tottering way; Yet smoothing as he came the rugged brow, \ Which rage and agony convub'd but now, > To Thoron's wife he made obei«ancc low: j " Health, royal lady—hands so fair as your's, My friend attests, can work no common cures: Ah, happy! while you heal the meaner part, Could those bright eyes forbear to pierce the heart. Hubert, that mitred Norman, dares to say, That all the wreck of this disastrous day 20 Springs from your guilt, who left—oh deed abhorr'd!— For this brave Prince your craven, woman-lord:* And, but Augustus check'd his priestly pride, The fools had come to force you from his side." <( To force!" cried Conrad, " can they then forget The wounded lion is a lion yet? The meddling knave were best his beads to tell— Sooth! for a priest he wields the falchion well; But mine; my friend, is weary of its rest, And longs to find a scabbard in his breast. 30
Have they forgot, in Syria's last alarm, Whose was the single ship, the single arm?— But I disdain to boast, I cannot teach My worth in words, my actions are my speech. To-morrow's dawn hails Isabelle my bride, Nor dare they touch her raiment at my side.— Forgive me, Princess, if my words be brief, And I forget the lover in the Chief; Augustus is my friend, nor durst he shew An adverse semblance, were his heart my foe. 40 Once join'd with thee, I speak as Sion's King, And drivelling Lusignan in vain may bring That high-souled Prince, whose warlike worth I hate, Richard may come, but he will come too late." " Then mark me, Conrad!" Isabelle replied, " No private rights beseem a regal bride; Sovereigns and Peers must grace the splendid scene,, And all the nuptial state that fits a Queen." That solemn mockery stains no stately pile, Where storied tapestry hangs the vaulted aisle; 50 No dome time-hallowed, where the tinctured rays Shine on the sculptured great of ancient days.. VOL. I. N
When Acre's siege began, the martial train Had rear'd with simple skill the modest fane. Yet those sleep there, whose souls now wrapt in bliss, Had wept in blood to witness deed like this; And on the walls in grand disorder shone Turbans and scymitars, from Moslems won. No deep ton'd music breath' d a solemn sound, Nor gold nor rubies gemm'd the altar round; 60 Yet piety had breathed the humble prayer O'er many a precious relic resting there, With zeal as pure as where the tapers blaze, And chaunting choirs th' eternal anthem raise. Behind the shrine a veil of crimson hue The sacred precinct veiled from vulgar view. Haughty yet mean, less studious to fulfil His Maker's precepts than his Suzerain's will, The Prelate of Beauvais, ministrant there, Insults his GodvWith vows he cannot hear. 70 Now came the Princess,—gold and purple blend On her rich robes, and high-born dames attend; Nor Gaul's degraded Majesty denied To view the guilty rites, and give the bride. Next moved the daring Prince; nor latent shame Deprest his courage, nor his glance could tame;
Yet more than lover's rapture seem'd to speak In his quick motion and his mantling cheek; Something o'er which the wondering gazer ran, Then shunn'd instinctive, and forebore to scan. 80 The Austrian next, whose summon'd smiles coneeal'd His lingering step, and smart of wounds half heal'd; Behind, and blended with the Tyrian train, His mail-clad warriors throng the narrow fane. Already round the altar's glittering fence Th' attentive Princes kneel,—the prayers commence; When from behind the silken veil arise Low sounds of smother'd sobs, and long-drawn sighs. The curtain opens—well may Conrad start, Well may the blood flow backward to his heart j 90 Well may he gaze upon that wasted frame, And ask, thus changed, ah ' can it be the same ^ Gone was the wreath her braided locks had worn, Her robes, once wrought with gold, defac'dand torn. Her glassy eyes a wandei ing mind bespeak, Yet beauty linger'd on her pallid cheek; And something scarce defined, in speech or mien, Of fair and noble, told what once had been: As in the wither'd rose a faint perfume Recalls the memory of itt summer bloom. 100 n 2
Her low soft tones a pleasing grief inspir'd, Yet sooth'd to pity, not to vengeance fir'd. " Oh! Conrad, Cæsar, or if thou require That name so dearly purchased,—Prince of Tyre! Think not I come to mar thy bliss, nor fear That hatred urges one no longer dear; 1 will not vex thee long, will but resign This ring, this precious ring that bound theo mine— Take it, proud Isabelle, and may he prove More true to thee, than to my slighted love. 110 Yet I was loved—and still beloved had been Had Stamboul's wretched Princess reigned a Queen. Nay, on my alter'd form your gaze forbear, Λ Nor what I was, nor am, is now my care: > I yet wore lovely, liad he thought me fair. } Nor think, though wild my sunken eye may seem, That some dark deed is in its wandering beam:— What though I felt not, when th' unpitying storm Has raged at midnight o'er my houseless form; Though I have flung me on the rocky brow, 120 And could not hear the cataract roar below, The soul which once in duty's path has trod, Not e'en when reason strays, forgets its God.
Still will I bear th' appointed load of pain, One only vision—Ha! it comes again ί A vaun t, ye murderers! God of mercy, give A longer span—let him repent and live— Ah, me! unshrieved the guilty soul has fled, And see! those phantoms thickening round the dead! Those forms that are not of the sons of light— 130 Oh, save me, save me, from the maddening sight!"— She scream'd! her hands wereclasp'dupon her head, A burning blush her wither'd cheeks o'erspread, And like a morning cloud, a broken spell, She vanish'd—how or whither none could tell. With lips whose pride the struggling shriek forbore, Though pale and trembling as the veil she wore, Stood Isabelle; but her unbending lord Own'd not his secret pangs in look or word; Unchanged, unshrinking was his eagle eye, 140 As when it gazed on Raymond's agony. With rapid glance he scann'd th' assembly round, Beheld the cloud on every face, and frown'd. " Princes, I read resentment on your brow— Say then, is Conrad's honour fall'n so low, The sport of every maniac's breath—as frail As the slight aspen in the summer's gale? n 3
Can ye not trace the sarac infernal powers Whose dreadful spells consumedourfire-proof towers? I reck not, though an hundred phantoms fair 150 Should come like feverish dreams, and melt in air; Nay I will thank them for this bridal ring, It well beseems the daughter of a King; I dread no ills its charmed round may breed— Most reverend prelate, let the rites proceed."— Convinced or awed, no warrior took the word. \ One hardy Tyrian stept before his lord, \ But shrunk, for Conrad half unsheath'd the sword.^ Fair Isabelle revived,—the rites were closed, Nor Philip's voice forbade, nor heaven opposed. 160 Already Ullah pours her baleful rains, And drives the armies from the miry plains; In Acre's domes her weary troops recline, On Kaisan's height the bands of Saladine, Alike unmenaced by the dearth and woe That threat the Christians in the camp below. Their fleets are wreck'd upon the stormy coast. Their stores consumed, their famish'd coursers lost; Want stalks abroad, and at her touch the skin Cleaves to the bone, and furies rage within. 170
Gaunt, fleshless forms, their meagre friends appal, And glide like spectres round the silent wall. Here sullen apathy forgets to feel, Here hunger revels on the loathsome meal; Here avarice, whose insatiate greed has sold His last sad pittance, dying, gnaws the gold. Love bids Alecto J s torch his lamp awake, And dips his arrows in the Stygian lake, While phrenzy never tamed, and horrid joy, With dreadful laughter mock their agony; 180 With loud blasphemings load the fetid air, And join, with Death, the banquet of despair. Now swell the streams to torrents, from the plain } Wash the half-buried bodies of the slain, V And with corruption foul, rush headlong to the main. } Contagion comes, and through the wasted frame Spreads,—as through Autumn woods the casual flame, When town, and tower, and ripening grain, by turns Feed the red fury, and a province burns. The brave in arms, untaught to shrink at death, 190 Start from their friends, and shun each other's breath. In vain the chiefs th' unbridled throng restrain, And Hubert warns of angry Heaven in vain j N 4
Shame flies with hope, they ьршп the theme sublime, And deeper plunge in misery andin crime; When lo 1 a fleet '—as o'er the boundless blue The banner'd Cross flung wide its sanguine hue, That holy symbol seem'd again to bear Mercy to man, and comfort to despair. Oh, needless mockery ,· on th' unguarded strand 200 Proud Adel springs, and bids his Egypt land; Tears down the bright delusion, and displays His yellow standard to their sickening gaze. With all the pomp of music, all the show Of selfish triumph when it scoffs at woe, Betwixt the Christians and the town he leads, Uncheck'd, that host whose countless sum exceeds The insect swarms that, far at distance seen, Blot the broad sun, and chase the vernal green. While from their walls they gaze, and blush to own Their life, their safety in those walls alone; While latent valour wakes, and aims the blow The wither'd arm is powerless to bestow; By turns his luxury mocks their need, by turns His taunts assail the wretched troop he scorns. Hope springs again, for hark, the trumpet's notes! O'er the near hills th' Imperial Eagle floats.
'Tis Frederic's van! back, buck, the portals fling, And hail with rapturous shouts the conquering King! Alas! Icomium's terror breathes no more, 220 O'ercome with toil, or fest'ring in their gore, His myriads sleep, and those that yet remain, Exhausted, pale, may wish them with the slain; While their sad Duke, who mourns his mighty sire, In filial sorrow sinks his martial fire; Nor feels that, lurking in the cup of grief, Disease has mark'd her prey, and mocks relief. Through the dark camp they spread a double gloom, And joined in misery, wail their common doom. While thousands thus accuse his long delay, 230 " Why lingers Richard on the waťry way?" The sun in sadness rose, in sadness set, The waves are clear, th' horizon spotless yet; Can Richard loiter when the clarions blow? Or hear of want, nor hasten to bestow?— Alike his spirit chafes; from day to day By storms imprison'd in Limisso's bay; At length escaped, in vain his sails expand, Some demon drives them from the Syrian land.
Yet with two favourite barks, before the rest 240 The royal galley skims the ocean's breast, And the clear waves play round each ruddy oar, As if rejoicing in the freight they bore. In the blue distance, faint and dim-descried, Like rock or islet looming o'er the tide, A Bfea-dowy form appear'd,— but soon it grew Near and more near, and now distinct to view; A mighty ship, with every mast defined, And all her canvass spread before the wind. Vast as those floating towns that bear afar 250 From pole to pole the storm of England's war; Yet ship like this, on all the azure reign, Nor Europe dreamt, nor Asia saw till then. With awe the crew its mighty bulk behold, And hostile pendants, bright as liquid gold: But for the expected fight the Monarch burns, And threats and promises inspire by turns; His galleys arm; the mariners in haste, On the sharp prow the frowning castle place; The knights their helmets brace, their lances wield, And from the gunwhale snatch th' em biazon'd shield.*
Meanwhile with all the press of oar and sail, And all the impulse of the strenuous gale, Th'enormous "Dromond "comes, and strives to whelm Her puny foes amid the watery realm. They shun the fatal shock, yet rudely tost, Now rise to heaven, and now in gulfs are lost; While closing o'er her track the billows roar, And chafe beneath th' unwonted load they bore. But Richard's voice the faltering yeomen cheers, " Gold for the valiant, death to him that fears!" He bids his galleys turn and court the wind, And pressing fast their heavier foe behind, Before the breeze with forceful speed they glide, And pierce with beaked prows her lofty side: The grappling hooks are fixed; the arrowy showers Pour like a tempest from the wooden towers, In vain—from plank or gunwhale they rebound, And strew the ocean, guiltless of a wound;
While swarthy Egypt at her foes beneath 280 Aims the deliberate blow, and scatters death. Nor thus content, with many a ready weight Of stones and lead, prepares their general fate. But England's King, whom no defence could bar, Now to the adverse deck transfers the war ,* For boldly standing on the castled prow, He climbs its loftier side, and leaps below. Him Leicester followed, fighting as he rose, Richmond and Nevile, dealing blows for blows. With envy fired, De Vere a and Sackville b spring 290 From either rival bark, to aid their King. Fast flows the purple tide,—yet wherefore tell How Albert fought, or stout Fitzharding c fell, Or Pardo's strokes in quick succession came With graceful ease, as war itself were game?— Hid in the darksome caverns of the deep Already twice their scanty numbers sleep; Where late presumption vaunted, fear assails, The clouded Crescent wanes, the Cross prevails. The sable Acbar now, in whose command 300 That dread of ocean left th' Egyptian strand, First in the fight while victory doubtful hung, Now at the Monarch's feet his sabre flung.
(ί Thou, at whose touch the Faithful fall!" he said, (( Thou, who hast borrow' d Azrael's venom'd blade, Rejoice; that arm which earth and Heaven defies, Ne'er reaped by sea or shore so rich a prize. Behold, contrived with what consummate art, How vast, how strong, how finish'd every part. From where the Nile its eastern tribute pours, 310 To Syria's strand we brought these warlike stores; These arms, these liquid fires, this hoard of grain, To Acre borne, had made your valour vain.* 1 Yet deem not, Infidel," and as he spoke The slumbering furies kindled in his look, "Deem not that these are thine,—my triumph mark, Where yon green ocean oozes through the bark- Learn how we combat on these wat'ry fields, What thou shalt win, and how a Moslem yields 1 Too blest to perish in destroying thee, 320 To ocean's caves I drag thee down with me." <c Die then thy chosen death," the Monarch cried, ' e My weary weapon scorns to tame thy pride; But vaunt no more:" and bounding o'er the rings Of dead and dying, to his bark he springs; Calls from their fancied spoil his warriors bold. The grappling irons wrenches from their hold,
And safe and free his galleys ride again, As their proud foe sinks darkly in the main. Now to their wishes shifts the prosperous gale, 330 They rest their oars, and loosen every sail; Beneath the cloudless sunbeams glittering bright, And sporting through a thousand ring« of light, Round the smooth keels the limpid waters play, Till, as they purpled in the evening ray, With rapture Richard hail'd the yellower line That traced in mist the shore of Palestine. Fill'd with one feeling, with one thought inspired, At sight of that so long in vain desired, One shout of holy joy the warriors gave, 340 A shout re-echoed by the dancing wave; By angels echoed with a heavenly strain, By fiends in mockery from their beds of pain: With streaming eyes they view the distant strand, And stretch their arms to meet the Promised Land. Nor less, from Acre's camp the Christians knew The white specks glimmering on the boundless blue; And gazing, linger on the darken'd shore, Till fancy's self can fix their place no more.
But soon a mimic day illumes the dark, 350 And lamps light up in each advancing bark j Round every mast are garlands wreathing bright, And every galley's form is traced in light; And Rams and Catapults, and engines dire, Shine on the crowded decks, and vomit fire. High to the clouds the living splendours glow, The bright reflexion gilds the deep below. O'er Richard's head, in lines of burnish'd gold Flamed his rich crown, his royal standard roll'd; And far above, a Cross serenely bright, 360 Beam'd, as from Heaven, its pure and silver light. It was an eastern night of loveliest calm, Each wave was music, and each zephy 1 balm. No mist the placid face of ocean knew, No cloud obscured the æther's deepening blue; And though no moonbeams played, a ruddier glow In grandeur clothed majestic Carmel's brow, And those devoted towers that shone so bright, Like victims, lovelier in their funeral light. No chilling blasts, no fatal dews were there, 370 To mar enjoyment of that tranquil air, So lately heavy with the damps of death, Now pure and fragrant as an infant's breath;
Or that blest eve, whose sacred dews arrest With drops of healing power, the raging pest j* Disease and pain, and wounds and famine seem From every bosom vanished like a dream; While as the fleet rows nearer to the shore The billows blush beneath each glittering oar, That dashes jets of living flame on high, 380 To shine and fade amid the lurid sky. The rivers glitter in the ¡spreading beam, The brightening ocean seems a flood of flame; From every brow has pass'd its hopeless gloom, And answering fires the Christian camp illume. The morn that called the Moslem host to prayer Still saw the happy Christians lingering there. The biazon'd sails beneath the sunbeams glance And gem, like floating clouds, the dark expanse. . Now drums and cymbals sound, the mellow flute 390 Blends its soft tones, nor is the clarion mute; And timing to their oars, the myriads raise The solemn chaunt or choral peal of praise.
Borne on the waters now the music floats Half lost in air, now swells its boldest notes, Now higher strains the vocal brass inspire, And angel voices seem to join the quire. Bright as that reed, by Ganges, (sacred name İ) Whose scarlet blossom clothes her banks in flame, The purple thistle on the Syrian wold, 400 Or fragrant asphodel that blooms in gold, Now pennons wave; bend, eagle, cross, and shell, The pomp of war or pride of lineage tell; And long and loud the shouts of welcome grew, Whene'er some well known banner flash'd to view; Or fancy on the distant prow could trace Some kindred shield, some long-expected face. Near and more near, they reach the crowded coast, Hope reads her triumph now, and doubt is lost j The vessels ground, and many a friendly hand, 410 And rapturous greeting, hail them to the strand. e First Richard springs to shore, and numbers spread The costly tapestry for his courser's tread; Favell, the noblest of the Cyprian spoil, Gentle and graceful, and untired by toil, In colour like the fields of ripening corn, Crimson and gold his beauteous limbs adorn; vol, i. о
With high-arched neck the splendid cloth he trodc, Proud of his trappings, prouder of his load; While envious of his state, in raven pride, 420 The Norman charger paces by his side. But wheresoe'er the Monarch's glances fall, His grace, his bland demeanour gladdens all;— Loud shout the Franks, the wondering Syriaus prest To gaze on him, the Hero of the West! Admire his sable hauberk's woven mail, His brazen axe that crushed where'er it fell/ His silken mantle glorious to behold; His saddle where the lions ramp'd in gold, His lion shield, his helmet lion-crown'd,* 430 And the gold broom-flower on its glittering round, 8 Behind, in long procession, moved the brave, And notes of triumph swell, and banners wave; The winds on high the English lions fling, And dragon standard of th' Armorie King.
The Monarch kneels, with all his Princes round, And kist with reverend awe the sacred ground; While Hubert lifts to Heaven his tearful eyes, And calls a thousand blessings from the skies. Now Philip came; whate'er of jealous pain 440 Had rankled, and must rankle there again, In neither heart such thought now found a place, And mutual love prolong'd the strict embrace. All, all was joy; for even Leopold In simulated smiles his hate contro 11' d: Conrad alone, unable to disguise, Roll'd daťk on Lusignan his baleful eyes. Nor less delighted numbers press the strand Where England's bridal Queen descends to land; Admire her regal mien, Evanthe's grace, 450 The holy calm of pale Matilda's face, Or sprightly Hermesind's aeriel bound, As like a fawn she ran and gazed around. Oh, talk of danger, talk of want no more! Λ From the tall ships in long succession pour ч Men, armour, weapons, every warlike store; y Sicilia's matchless grain, Oporto's wine, h \ The unpressed honours of the Cyprian vine, > The steer well fatted, and the salted chine. y о 2
All,— but their names the sated ear would tire, 400 All want could need, or luxury might desire. The ships are drawn on shore, and now revealed, Those portals fall that late the waves concealed; The snorting steeds rush joyful to the land, And neigh aloud for liberty regained.' Rich stuffs are heap'd where'er the gazer turns, And lances gleam, and polish'd armour burns. And o'er their cups the jovial circles sing. The power, the boundless wealth of England's King. In Richard's tent was spread the gorgeous feast, At Richard's board sate every noble guest; Brave, courteous, generous, with untroubled mind, To all around magnificently kind, He dreams not that his gifts renew the smart Of envy lurking in Augustus' heart; While hovering nigh, Alkarmel sees with pain \ The peaceful parting of the princely train; V Of those who ne'er shall part in peace again. y But whose that gay pavilion? Blazing bright, Streams through the silk the many colour'd light, Its ample space in Persian splendour drest, And rich with all the perfumes of the east,
Vast as the tent for great Kerboga wove, k Each spicy gale seems redolent of love? While all his vassals brave the dews, the wind, Rests Richard here, in luxury's arms reclined? No! his adventurous soul was bent to share Whate'er his meanest serf might feel or dare: But all that splendour to himself denied, He freely lavish'd round his lovely bride. 490 " Enough," he thought, " she feels of toil and woe, And small the comforts I can here bestow, Yet, oh! while mine the power, from her be far The fears, the horrors, and the wants of Avar." Her train dismiss'd, the Cyprian Princess there Alone remains, her anxious thoughts to share. Why, sw r eet Evanthe! does thy faded cheek The secret touch of pining grief bespeak? Ah î what avails that thine the winning smile, The grace, the softness of thy native isle; 500 Thy golden locks, the languish of thine eyes, But gain thee hearts that thou canst never prize! Kind, gentle, modest, and sincere in vain, Thy snowy bosom heaves alone with pain; E'en from the hour that to thyself revealed Thy fatal flame, with growing pain concealed, o3
Bereft of hope, for thine unspotted breast Ne'er harbour'd guilty wish, or thought unblest. Thy love, like lamps in Egypt's ancient tombs, Nor chilling damps can quench, nor time consumes; And should some fatal chance reveal the fire, At once, like them, shall life and love expire. Thy wither'd bloom the fruitless struggle tells Of strong resolve with more than human spells; Thine only joy to gaze on Richard's eye, Yet thy sole hope, thy last resource to fly. She rose, with pain the rising pang supprest, And sought her couch:—oh! may she hope to rest.— " Why," cried the King, with all a lover's fear, " Why, Berengaria, wilt thou linger here? 520 That form, till now by trembling zephyrs woo'd, Has braved the gales of ocean, keen and rude, Must brave the journey o'er the sandy waste, And worse than toil, the desert's sultry blast: Yet, thy soft frame with equal toils oppress Thou scorn'st to sleep when hardiest warriors rest! Short is their respite who with warriors live, But take the little case my care can give; Nor let thy fading hue and heavy eyes Betray the languor which thy tongue denies." 530
(i And think'stthou, Richard, that my cheek is pale? 'Tis but these faithless lamps that tell the tale. Why did I winds, and waves, and deserts dare, But to partake thy counsels and thy care? Oh, Richard î if my fragile frame must fail At every toil, and shrink from every gale, Why am I thine? oh! why did lavish fame Teach me, unknown, to kindle at thy name, And think how blest above her sex must be The happy maid whom heaven should link with thee? How throbb'd my heart in thee to find the Knight I crown'd as victor of Pamplona's fight! * And oh! what joy my inmost spirit stirr'd, To find myself by Richard's choice preferr'd 1 Yet then I felt, amid my rapturous pride, What Heaven demanded of a hero's bride; Not with her foolish fears and puny frame To check his course, and clog his rising fame; Nor changing with each wild caprice of fate, Too soon dejected, and too soon elate. Ш) Arm'd 'gainst myself, I prob'd my heart with care, Tried all its powers, to suffer or to dare; And had I found no answering vigour move, Dear as thou wert, I had resign'd thy love,— о 4
Why all this pomp? why wilt thou feed mine eyes With luxuries thou hast taught me to despise? No more this gorgeous down is spread for me, Lo! there the couch that I must share with thee. What! could'st thou then his living rage deride, And starťst thou, Richard, at the Lion's hide? 560 Nay! 'tis a beast in tuneful story known, Generous his heart, and royal as thine own." Still on her face the Monarch fix'd his gaze, Lost in an ecstacy of love and praise, Again reminds her of the waning night, And speaks of Council with the earliest light. Exalted pair! unless your couch be blest, What mortal eyes can hope untroubled rest! 'Tis morn; and now th' assembled Chiefs debate, How best their arms may seal the city's fate. 570 Three splendid thrones adorn'd the spacious ring, One Richard fill'd, and one the Gallic King. A third for him who in the Cydnus died, Now Conrad claim'd, and Lusignan denied.*
Meanwhile the Chiefs to royal Richard yield The leader's staff, and bid him rule the field. But Philip brook'd not this; the last night's feast, The shouts, the triumph, rankled in his breast, His spirit chafed to see the equal throne, 580 The fame, the riches, that outvied his own. " Shall I to England stoop the pride of France, And at a vassal's bidding couch the lance? I whose rich blood from Rome's defender springs, The first of Western thrones, the " King of Kings?" ra Be mine the sway, or I no more proceed, I will not follow where I ought to lead. And more—let Richard's avarice now resign Half of that prize, by solemn treaty mine; They may be rich who other's wealth withhold, 590 And generous that reward with other's gold; And fools may still with hireling praise pursue The hand so lavish of another's due; But know thy Suzerain never can allow The Cypriot crown in peace to bind thy brow ¿
Nor she thy doting passion brings from far, She called thy bride, the daughter of Navarre, To reign as England's Queen, and boast perchance You scorn'd for her the plighted maid of France."*— " Nor think," cried Conrad, " that I tamely see ίς A worthless rival here preferr'd to me. Shall Lusignan display his white-veiled car, And lead again his betters to the war? Bid him that badge of sovereign power resign, Once his indeed, but now as justly mine. Mine, in the right of Isabelle my bride— I blame thee, King, for thou abett'st his pride." They ceased, and clamour rose: but Richard's look Still'd every tongue to silence, ere he spoke. " Strange welcome this i that on your comrade showers 610 The hatred due to Acre's stubborn towers! Philip, our vows of Vezelay I own, \ But not thy right to share the Cyprian throne; \ Alone I won it, and I rule alone. y Yet mark—Theodoric's soul now wings its flight, And leaves his wide domain his Suzerain's right;
One half of Flanders to my rule resign," And half of Cyprus, nay its best, is thine; This justice wills—deny or grant the claim, Our pledge was mutual, and our rights the same. 620 But chafe not that my troops are brave, that Heaven To me a rich and pious land has given, Whose loyal sons, to him how justly dear. Press on their King the wealth thou envy'st here!— If gold thou seek'st, lead on to yonder wall— Let Acre yield—this strife delays her fall. But for thy sister, for my bride, beware The sacred theme, I warn thee to forbear. I loved Alasia once, I loved too well, Who dared for her against my sire rebel. 630 Thou heard'st when Heaven in awful thunder spoke, When Heaven's red bolt the fatal contract broke;* Thou know'st the cause, ah! bid me not reveal What knightly honour would for ever seal. " Conrad, I will not pause to question now, If heaven or hell have register' d the vow That sanctions thy wild hope—I boast no right To pluck the beam that dims a brother's sight.
Yet 'mid such clamour for an empty throne If claims were wanting, I might bring my own. 640 From Fulk° I also spring—this biting blade Perchance might make a substance of the shade, And I, fit umpire, to the fable true, Might gorge the prize, and leave the shell for you. But Lusignan in me has placed his trust, And I uphold him, for his claims are just; Myself will be his rampart, and do thou Who mocked a friendless wretch, respect him now." He spoke—th' assembled Princes own'd that hour The force of justice from the lips of power. 650 Nor was it eloquence of words alone, Each glance, each act, each modulated tone Soft as the dews on sun-burnt Afric stole, Sunk in the thirsty ear, and fertilized the soul. But Philip bent his brows— fi Be warn'd," he cried, t( The hour may come when thou shalt rue thy pride. I rush to war, but not to swell thy line, Our fame, our fortune, can no more combine: Go, waste your strength before yon sullen towers, To meet the Soldan's frowning front be ours; 660 Yet there are means, perchance to thee unknown, By which the city may be all my own."
" By Heaven I thank thee! thou hast given to me In wrath, what I had craved in courtesy," Return'd Plantagenet; his knights he calls, Mounts his swift steeds and rides along the walls, To mark were time or force had wrought decay, Or careless guard might give th' assailants way; Nor heeds the hostile darts that shower around, Inglorious darts, that fall without a wound. 670 The monarch notes where ocean's hoarded tide With copious draught the stagnant moat supplied, A flowing river, devious o'er the plain, That now approach'd the town, now shunn'd again, But where th' Accursed ramparts rose in air. Spread in a pool, and seem'd to vanish there. " It cannot be," the King exulting cried, ťí That space so small engulfs yon rapid tide! Be secret, Albert; but when night shall hide The daring purpose, then collect thy force, 680 And for this stream delve deep the hidden course, So thirst shall rule in Acre, and prepare The stings of death for those the sword shall spare/'? He spoke, and launching half his barks again, Surveys the frowning bulwarks from the main.
Across the waves a mighty mole extends, In form a crescent, and the port defends; On all its length defensive ramparts rise, And at its end the Tower of Sacrifice. Thence to the Patriarch's tower, a mighty chain 690 Stretch'd its huge links, and dipp'd beneath the main.' 1 This lowered with speed, admits the prompt supplies, Then checks the pursuit, or secures the prize. Here Austria late and baffled Pisa storm'd; But holier zeal th' intrepid Monarch warm'd. Careless of missiles showering from above, His bark beneath the Patriarch's fort he drove, Where to a granite pillar's ample round. With massy rings its iron length was bound; And seized his Norman axe,—that axe whose weight Was then a wonder, and whose touch was fate. He rais'd it high, and bending from the prow, With all his giant force impels the blow; He strikes, and strikes but once, the links divide, And fall, harsh grating, through the gurgling tide: Then to the port his gallant fleet he led, And form'd with strictest care the close blockade.
Káhira,* et the Victorious," sends in vain Her rice, her sesame, her golden grain, The loaded vessels dread the guarded shore, 7Ю And plenty reigns in Acre's walls no more; In Vain her friends their anxious vigils keep, The troops by land, the galleys on the deep, Their Argus rests not, nor surprise can win Its way without, nor sallies from within: While Albert's train their nightly labour urge, Till the long channel reached the ocean's verge. Their task is ended,—with redoubled force Flows the glad river in its new-made course, And Acre's nymphs at morning's earliest beam, 720 Who sought with thirsty urns th' accustom'd stream. Already weak with want, with watching pale, In terror saw the copious river fail; They call on Alla's name, their robes they tear, And beat their breasts, and shriek in wild despair, Yefc could not Conrad's soul its hate resign, Nor Gaul's proud King with warlike England join; Their vassals sue, and frequent councils sate, But fresh invective breeds increase of hate.
Oft Philip's rage his eager knights restrain'd, 730 And murmuring, in th' inglorious camp detain'd, Forgetful why those sacred plains he trod, False to his fame, and treacherous to his God: Nor when he fought, could Montmorency's might, Conrad, or Austria, or the Emerald knight, Command the fate of war; the day's decline Oft saw their forced retreat from Saladine, Till Richard on the victors pouring down, Redeem'd the half-won wreath, and made the field his own. Three weeks have pass'd; on Acre's mouldering wall Gaunt famine paces, and foredooms her fall. Beneath enormous engines, day by day Her ramparts crumble and her towers decay; Yet on no lip an angry murmur hung, Surrender breathed not from one dastard tongue. Yet had her pride been quell'd, but fever reigns In Richard's frame, and wastes his burning veins; Weak as a babe his sinewy form reclined, And wild chimæras vex his mighty mind,*
Till his good angel, with ætherial touch, 750 Compels the lingering demon from his couch; His sunken eye reviving light illumes, And his high soul the schemes of war resumes. Augustus, jealous of his rival's arms, Watch'd his returning strength with new alarms; He vows to seize his prey, his heralds wait On Asia's King, and treat of Acre's fate. The Soldan, anxious to redeem the brave, Yet scorn'd the haughty terms his avarice gave, And Acre's warriors vow'd nor fire, nor sword, 760 Nor want should bow them to so stern a lord.* Again Augustus sent: he craves to meet The Arabian Ruler, and in person treat " No," cried the Soldan, " first must discord cease, We hold that Monarchs can but meet in peace; I could not here behold your Sovereign rest, Nor spread the banquet for my princely guest. 'Twere strange, if, rising from the friendly board, Our hands again should grasp the hostile sword.",voi« ι.,ρ
Meanwhile, unconscious of the snare below, 770 Impatient Richarb plans a final blow; To every post his battering train has drawn, And fix'd the onset for the morrow's dawn. That night, before his tent in pensive mood, The purple concave restless Albert vieWd, And oft while thinking of his lonely bride, To the mute stars his secret sorrows sigh'd. " Remote from thee, how slow the moments move! Increasing distance adds new force to love. If but to Europe's neighbouring shores I roam, 780 Less keenthepang,—still something breathes of home; But in these wilds not man alone is strange, Beasts, birds, and plants, e'en hours and seasons change; Each moment gives the sad reflection hirth, I see another heaven, another earth; I cannot think that now thy dewy eyes Watch yon bright planet through the purple skies; No ΐ when thou turn'st to court the placid moon, On burning sands we dread the sultry noon; And when thy landscape sparkles in the morn, 790 Here stars unknown the stranger heaven adorn. I feel the lavish dews of night descend, I see the skies unwonted radiance lend:
But vain their lustre, from thy presence driven I long for Europe's less refulgent heaven, And thy soft smile, more pleasing to my sight Than all the splendours of a Syrian night." Late sunk the warrior to his troubled rest, And woke ere morning glimmer'd an the east. He past to Pardo's tent;—prepared for fight, 800 His burnish'd armour caught the doubtful light; A silver gauze was on the leopard shield, Till fame should bid its blazon stand reveal'd.* But all was silent, till Ricardo came Pale from his vigils near his thoughtless dame. " Up, Pardo! boaster, up! I little guest That we must rouse thine eager soul from rest!" No answer breath'd,—aloud they call'd again, They search his tent, and wake his squires in vain. u Ha!" laugh'd Ricardo, tf does soine damsel keep His secret thoughts, and chase his vaunted sleep?" " Say, rather," Albert cried, with terror thrill'd, " Does some rash venture lure him to the field? Oh! why so secret to his friend? and why To share his danger or his fame deny?",γ 2
It chanced that Philip, more devoted far To courtly pleasures than the toils of war, Had brought to Palestine a countless race Of hounds accomplished, trained to every chase, And fearless falcons, that would even dare 820 Their own fierce monarch in his realms of air. One morn the fleetest, best beloved of all, His jesses broke and flew to Acre's wall, And Philip, grieved to see his favourite roam, A thousand marks proclaimed to him should lure him home/ With all a warrior's wrath young Pardo heard Such princely ransom offer'd for a bird; Yet,—for wild perils ever pleased him best,— He scorn'd the gold, but vow'd to try the quest. Clad in light arms, alone he took his way, 830 And scarcely waiting for the close of day, Wrapt in his mantle, sought the town so near, The oft repeated watch-word met his ear* The truant bird upon a turret's height There sate unshelter'd from the dews of night, And while less dear its late-won freedom grew, Regrets its dainty fare and gilded mew.
The Knight's soft whistle bids its slumber fly, Instinctive it obeys, and flutters nigh; Then fears the stranger voice, or, moved again 840 By powerful nature, loathes its silver chain, Eludes his grasp, nor heeds the frequent calls That check returning sleep, and chase it round the walls. Long, long he follows, till at midnight hour The falcon lighting on th' Accursed Tower, Seemed like some demon on the fated wall Malignant perch'd, portentous of its fall. How oft, when wilder'd long in error's night, Truth's daylight lustre flashes on our sight! The darkness flies like mists when morning glows, And Reason questions, whence that darkness rose?— Thus Pardo, musing now where art had led Th' obedient river from its ancient bed, Felt, as at once the Heaven-sent impulse shone, Through that deserted course to reach the town. To think and act were one, he lingers not To seek a comrade's aid; the bird forgot, And with his pointed dagger arm'd alone, He strikes the turf and time-cemented stone, Fearful lest foes surprise him, or the sun, 860 With envious beam, reveal his work half done. г 3
At length his toils a narrow opening win, The trampled earth gives way and crumbles in; Now by his hands he hung, and, rashly bold, But breathed a prayer succinct, and loosed his hold. Saved by the moisture lingering yet below, Where erst the deepest stream was wont to flow, Unharm'd he rose, without one guiding ray, And groped along the side his dangerous way, Save when his arms in rough collision call 870 Short gleams of splendour from the flinty wall. Oh! should he wander in the dreadful gloom? Should waves engulph him, should some pit entomb? Or that mephitic damp, whose baleful breath Haunts the deep cavern, lull him into death?— But hail that stream of pure and fragrant air! Hail to that ruddy beam! success is there. Where late the river sparkled from its cave, A pompous arch had spann' d the dashing wave, Before its mouth the crackling faggots burn, 880 And Arabs watch 5—oh! should the stream return! Tall reeds that in the humid channel grew, Concealed the listening warrior from their view? While dimm'd with clay, his arms, his unsheath'd sword Had now no lustre to betray their lord:
Though oft between him and the bickering flame Gigantic, dark, the martial figures came. He heard them speak of famine, thirst, and woe, The tottering towers, the valour of the foe; That, should their mprning sally, nor the might 890 Of Adel aid them, they must yield at night. Then when at sunrise other troops prepared To change the watch, and rest the weary guard, Unmark'd he sprang, and snatch'd with venturous hand, Full from the piny pile a blazing brand; And traced his backward course with steps so fleet, An eagle's pinions seem'd to buoy his feet. But Gaul's insidious King again had sent His secret herald to the Soldan's tent, What time to Saladine a soldier bore 900 An arrow, shot from Acre's nearest tower; Its barbed point a fatal scroll revealed, " Famine surrounds me; aid us, or we yield.' '— . " Alas! my Karacous, how great must be The weight of woe that draws complaint from thee!" Exclaim'd the anxious Soldan, as in liaste His rapid hand the needful mandate traced: p4
" A Gallic herald waits. Maintain the fight; Or aid, or terms, I promise ere the night:"— He wrote, and sought a messenger to bear, 910 Unseen, his bidding thro' the trackless air. Far from the callow nestlings of her love, Sate mournful in her cage a spotless dove. The gentle bird her welcome duty knew, And at his call with joyful instinct flew, And raised her wing obedient, while his hand Fix'd the small tablet by a silken band. One moment on her smiling master's breast, As in a loved sojourn, she paused to rest, Rais'd to his face her mild and grateful eye, 920 Then spread her wings and vanish' d in the sky." Meanwhile the earliest beam of orient day Call'd round the English King his proud array. So rich their mail, their arms so burnish'd bright, Their helms, their lances, so profuse of light, Their shields so precious from the limner's art, They seem adorn'd to play some festal part; But they, so late in beauty's halcyon hour The grace, the glory, of her glittering bower; Skill'd every courtly revel to prolong, 930 And every fleeting joy embalm in song;
When fame invites, regard nor toil nor scar, Gentle in peace, but thunderbolts in war. Young Pardo now rush'd in, and from his hand Cast the poor relics of his guiding brand: *' What, Pardo! thou, so active and so gay, Why now so late? and thus besmear'd with clay?" <( An hour has scarcely fled," the youth exclaim'd, " Since that expiring brand in Acre flam'd; I snatch'd it from the pyre, and yonder sun 940 Shall see it light the flames that blaze for Acre won." He paus'd an instant, then in breathless haste, All his long labours of the night retraced. " Oh! thou rash youth! yet in thy rashness dear," The Monarch cried, " what daring deed is here! Must all our veteran cheeks be red with shame, While Acre's trophies swell a stripling's fame? Enough—when eve her glimmering light shall lend, By Pardo led, to victory we descend." Scarce had he spoke, when in the air above 950 A hungry falcon chased a beauteous dove; Who drawing courage in her last despair, For man, once feared, forsakes the fields of air;
And, as ой røeauer perch she scorn'd to rest, Instinctive refuge took in Richard's breast;* While Pardo, as it blindly followed, caught The wayward falcon, long so vainly sought. Upon the Monarch's silken scarf reposed, ■ Soon the faint bird her meek dark eyes unclosed, While Richard mark'd, and loos'd the silken string That bound the fateful billet to her wing. Incensed he read, t( Yes! while we bleed, we toil, To win these ramparts, Philip steals the spoil! The fight he shuns, yet basely treats alone For secret render of the falling town. E'en now perchance he robs us of our right! — Pardo, thine ambush must not wait for night j Tell Raymond France is false, but fortune ours; Then while again we storm those crumbling towers, Lead thou his warriors through the secret track—970 'Tis Albert's charge to turn the sally back." Meanwhile the dove her lingering course pursued To Acre, where ten thousand warriors stood,
With upward glance, and watch'd with stifled breath, The guiltless messenger of life or death. Why comes she not as wont, with joyous spring To yield her charge, and rest her wearied wing? Too soon they guess'd, too soon in mute despair Perceived her flagging plumes and drooping air. No outward hurt her smooth white down display'd, But, inly conscious of her trust betrayed, Far from her mate she took her lonely stand, Shunn'd all once loved, but most her master's hand; To hear his call, to taste his bread denied, Sate silent on her perch, and pined, and died.,END OF BOOK V.

CŒUR DE LION.,BOOK VI.,THE CAPTURE OF ACRE. Now wakes the contest—now those frames of wood, That vast and high, in uncouth stillness stood, Are all instinct with life;— Balistæ pour The flaming Phalaric, or the stony shower;* With ceaseless blow the heavy Ram is swung, And blazing oils in dreadful tempest flung. In vain the Moslems from the heights dispense All that can wound the frame, or shock the sense;
The limbs of mangled comrades, sheets of flame, And poison'd arrows, kindling as they came; 10 And wheels, those missiles most accurst and dire, That wrap the struggling wretch in rings of fire. In vain the clarions brayed, with awful clang Boomed the deep gong, and batter'd armour rang,— The Christians still press on; the tortoise spreads Its mighty buckler o'er their fearless heads; They heap the fosse, they mine the tower, they rear Their ladders high, and mount undaunted there j Those frail supports give way, or from the wall, Hurl'd headlong down, o'erwhelm them in their fall; Yet still they climb anew, they storm the height, And from their comrades' shoulders urge the fight. Against th' (t Accursed Tower" the Monarch set His favourite engine, vaunted " Robynette," This Jerworth rules; by sixty winters bent, His vigorous frame still proved his proud descent From Caradoc, whose arm of steel might claim, "\ 'Mid Arthur's Paladins no second fame, \ The faithful partner of the truest dame, y The soul of war"—in youth had Jer worth's hand, With England wrestled for his native land; 30
And latest near the dying Hoel stood, When the blue Ceriog blush'd with Cambrian blood; Nor now less valiant, as the masses break, With blows redoubled, and the ramparts shake, Himself directs the Ram, and bending low, Lends all his vigour to the mighty blow. But Mestoc mark'd him, and the dart impell'd— Too sure a course the fated weapon held; And where the casque and plated mail combine, Pierced through th' unguarded neck, and reach'd the spine. 40 Oft when sweet Spring with music loads ι he gale, Shall Mona's Bards his silent harp bewail; Oft, when solstitial storms unbridled roar, And snow is drifting on her mountain shore, Lament for one who wiled those nights away With tales of climes beyond the setting day:— For Jerworth sail' d with him whose patriot pride Disdain'd a conqueror's yoke, across the tide Where never yet had venturous pilot steer'd, Nor Celtic speech, nor name of Christ was heard j 50 Where all to them was ¡strange, and they to all— Who won a kingdom, reared th' embattled wall, VOL. i. Q
Preach'd in Mexitli's fane th' Eternal Word, And bow'd the strength of Astian to his sword;* With Madoc he return'd, but not again Stemm'd with that daring Prince th' Atlantic main; He staid, above his mother's grave to rear The votive roses, nurst with many a tear; Till England's Primate, in his vigorous age, \ Relumed the Christian's zeal, the warrior's rage; \ What time the priest, in sacred pilgrimage, * While countless miracles attest his truth, Call'd to the Holy War the Cambrian youth. f Not unavenged he fell, his javelin leaves King Richard's hand, and Mestoc's side receives
Beneath his lifted arm!—it spared the life, But forced th' unwilling Emir from the strife. Meanwhile the King, who mark'd his warriors fly The fate of Jerworth, lifts his voice on high: ic And can yc tremble, Christians! ye who fight 70 For Him who framed yon firmament of light; Him whose least word could crush yon rebel towers, Or arm embattled hosts of angel powers? But he to us ordains them, bids us dare The might of hell, and earn salvation there. Think of your sires, that o'ei this race prevail'd, Whom rescued Sólyma triumphant hail'd; Whose names th' eternal scrolls of heaven record, Then ť woe to him who wears a stainless sword.'"* His rallying troops th' inspiring call obey, 80 Again the missiles fly, the engines play; He guides the dread Petraria, f high he heaves A rocky mass; the whistling air it cleaves, It strikes the ramparts; by its weight o'erthrown, Twelve gasping Moslems sink beneath the stone. t,«2
Again he loosed the engine, hurl'd below, The batter'd fort receives the fatal blow, Where Philip late had forced the breach; in haste To prop the tower were wooden stancheons placed, AH seem'd secure, but now the facings fall, 90 And the crush'd stone betrays th' imperfect wall. " A torch!" the Monarch cried, and Rodney's hand Snatch'd with undaunted zeal the flaming brand; The Moslems mark th' attempt, and from the height Shower all their fury on the daring Knight; Unharm'd he moves beneath his lifted shield, And thrice rush'd on, but thrice compell'd to yield; Again advanced, while England's archers drove The wounded Syrians from the walls above; 'Twas then that Karacous infuriate spoke: Î00 ťc Is death more fearful than the Christian yoke? Women of Asia! forward to the wall, What boots your dastard lives, if Acre fall?" He spoke, nor pausing, with tremendous blow Sends half the frowning battlement below; Just as the Knight the fatal flame applies, \ Crush'd by the weight a shapeless mass he lies, ч Commends his parting soul to Heaven, and dies I \
Grieved, yet unaw'd, the King review'd his bands, No venturous Knight the dangerous task demands; He smiled, and by his courage ruled alone, iC 'Tis well," he cried, r ' *his glory is my own!"— Then rose the general shout, his warriors spread Their broad tough bucklers o'er their Sovereign's head. Again the Syrian Chief dismiss'd the spear, And aim'd too well, for Richakd's fate was there; But a young knight, intrepid, rush'd between, And made his bleeding breast his Monarch's screen. As his sad squires bore off their fainting load, One hasty glance the grateful King bestow'd; 120 But paus'd not in his course, " On! on!" he cries, He reached the tower, the bickering flames arise. " Ob, water! water!" Long that fearful cry Had Acre heard, nor found her springs reply; All shrunk in dust, so well with Richard's care The cloudless skies conspired, and glowing air, Not her drain'd tanks, nor yet her treacherous stream Could yield one drop to check that spreading flame; The heavy ramparts nod, the fires, devour Their last support—down falls th' "Accursed Tower." q 3
" On to the breach, ye flower of England, on! The city falls, th' invincible is won." Ci Not yet, blasphemers I" Karacous replies, And by his hand the youthful Osbert dies; b — Osbert, of Clinton's blood, whose knightly grace And gentle worth adorned his noble race. Rotrou of Perche next storms the yawning breach, His rapid blows th' opposing Azim reach; But soon a blazing hoop en wreathed them round, 4 In one infernal orb of torture bound, 140 s. They fight, they writhe, they struggle on the ground, y Till kindred fire their gallant limbs consume, Foes in their lives, companions in the tomb- First on the height, uncheck'd by hosts of foes, The Moslem dread, Plantagenet arose; Next Bertrand sprung, the peril of the strife, Wounds, clamour, death, to him were joy, were life; His was an ardent heart, in youth deprest By one sad blow, it sunk, but not to rest; He loved to set his wealth upon the die, 150 He loved the banquets of intemperate joy, The bleeding hurry of the battle plain, Whate'er could rouse that heart to feel again.
The warriors follow fast, yet scarce behold Mosques, cupolas, aud minarets of gold, And blossom'd groves, when lo! a wall of fire Shuts out each marble dome, each glittering spire! Vast piles of wood, for other labours placed, And heaps of useless engines, fired in haste, Oppose their progress; but the Monarch cast 160 One glance inspiring, i( It must fade at last! Even now it fades! beyond are fame or death, The spoils of Acre, or the martyr's wreath." Now ranged behind, a wall of steel appears, So close the bucklers joined and glittering spears. ' e 'Tis well 3" again the ardent Richard cries, (i The truly brave would scorn too cheap a prize." But was it lowering storm, or wizard spell, That on the fight unnatural darkness fell! No storm, for cloudless is th' ætherial blue, 170 Nor is it sober twilight's solemn hue, Nor the chaste smile of Cynthia's summer night, Her broad deep shadows, and her silver light. Yet to their nests the screaming ravens fly, And stars are glimmering in the mid-day sky! q 4
Cold breathes the altered gale, a livid shade Dims every brow, the glowing banners fade j The moon invades the sun, whose golden ray, Bright in solstitial pride, contests her sway.* Still at th' appointed hour the awful night 180 Spreads her black veil, the morn her saffron light; Wrapt in the snowy tempest Winter conies, And bounteous Spring in fragrant mildness blooms. Nor pauses man, to question why or whence, For the familiar wonder palls the sense. He deems it awful, when the tempests wake The mountain echoes, when the forests shake, When lightning gilds the dark, and the gnarl'd oak, That braved a thousand winters, feels the stroke. Yet are those solemn changes most sublime, 190 That bursting seldom from the womb of Time, Recall th' Almighty Architect, and hold Their silent course, foreseen but not control'd;— That, breaking Nature's common laws, sustain, Her vast, immutable, eternal reign. The warring armies paus'd, and every eye, In mute devotion, sought the darken'd sky.
ζί Ha! King of England, mark'st thou yonder sun? As erst when Sion by our arms was won,* That boasted emblem of thy Christian creed 200 Wanes to a crescent—do I rightly read?" " Aye! for that Crescent shall expire as soon As yon bright orb shakes off th' invading moon. Come! thou that gavest those vauntingaccents breath, Come if thou därest! and prove it by thy death." In murder'd Alberic's costly mail indued, The giant son of Acre's ruler stood. " Methink'st this spoil may teach your trembling host That Aralchais breathes no idle boast." He spoke; his hands the crooked sabre wield, 210 But dauntless Richard on his lion shield Received, nor shrunk beneath the powerful stroke, Nor flew the buckler, nor the weapon broke. Wondering the Moslem gazed, —but Richard now, That shield uplifting, with the sudden blow Dash'd him to earth—upon his side he prest His sinewy knee, and pierced his ample chest.
cc Winton," he said, " strip thou this braggart foe, And bear his spoils to Philip—bid him know That I aveng'd his Marshal."—Then again 220 To the fierce charge he leads his eager train; They break the adverse ranks, and hurrying on, With blood and clamour fill the spacious town. But louder than the angry din of war, The voice of Karacous resounds afar: " Hold, thou that slay'st the fairest of the fold, Thou murdrous Lion, scourge of Islam; hold! Hear, and let terror cloud thy brutal joy, A childless father claims his valiant boy, His Aralchais."—Stem the veteran stood, 230 His sabre reeking with a hero's blood; The blood of Mowbray, o'er whose castle gate The helmet hung in hospitable state; Where still the warmest seat and choicest wine Hail'd the tired pilgrim from the holy shrine; Who to tne Templars many a wide domain \ Gave with a liberal hand, nor gave in vain; ч Once had they saved him from the Soldan's chain, d j And sent to England,—happy if no more His pious feet had trod the Syrian shore; 240
Yet to his worth a martyr's crown is given, On earth he slumbers, to awake in Heaven. Now met the warriors; Richard casts below A look of wonder on his pigmy foe, With limbs curtail'd, unequal, and deform'd, But the rude clay a soul of valour warm'd. " Exult not, Monarch, in thy towering height, Thy fair proportion, or thy boasted might; The loftiest cedar feels the woodman's stroke, And the red lightning strikes the proudest rock: 250 'Tis I have shed your Christian blood like rain, And made one grave of all yon ample plain. I bid thee now thy fancied spoil resign, For while I breathe believe not Acre thine; The city's fate is on our swords, on high The vulture whets her beak, and knows that one shall die." Each held a spear, but, by one impulse sway'd, Cast it to earth, and drew the deadlier blade. The sword of Karacous, in Beder's field And Bosra's, once had Ali's strength impell'd, 200 That giant strength whose single effort slew The mail-clad warrior and the courser too.
But Richard's magic steel, six ages gone, Was fram'd by Merlin for Pendragon's son. The sage, lest meaner hand its edge should wield, In wild romance the Monarch's death coneeal'd; How, nurs'd by fairies in their bowers of bloom, Th' awakening hero should his reign resume. But time reveal'd the truth—to England's King Of Arthur's grave the bards of Gwyneth sing; 270 He sought fair Avalon's romantic isle, Where Severn circles Glaston's time-worn pile, And raised the stone beneath her altar's shade, Where by Gcneura's side the Monarch laid; Time had not changed his form, august though palej Nor loos'd one rivet from his iron mail. Kneeling, the King evoked the mighty dead, Whose hand relaxing loos'd the gifted blade, Then vow'd that sword, by favouring powers bcstow'd. Should fight the battles of his injur'd God. e 280 Now first he wields it, and with forceful sway Rends half th' Egyptian's turban'd casque away. But Karacous, with strength that more became The arm of Ali than his stunted frame, Strikes on the groin, and though the hauberk broke Its force, the palsied limb confest the stroke;
Nor might the staggering King the blow repeli When on his arm the heavy sabre fell, And but a chain the precious weapon bound, Th' unrivall'd Caliburn had press' d the ground. 290 ' e Spirit of Arthur! dost thou see," he said, ie How t ill this coward hand deserves thy blade I" Stung with the thought he smites his gallant foe Full on the chest, and blood succeeds the blow. Now pours the storm of mutual wrath amain, Nor e'er those gifted weapons fell in vain,— For where no crimson current mark'd the stroke Helmet and shield were pierced, and corselet broke. But Richaiid's height, (though bothalike were brave) And length of arm superior vantage gave; 300 Till Karacous, who bled from many a wound, Indignant flung his buckler to the ground; Now with sinister hand the sabre held, Now with the right, and now with both impell'd. iC Not, not alone!" he cried—but Richard's care Check'd on his shield the effort of despair; For where the dexter lion frown'd, the sword Stuck in the golden mass; nor might its lord Again withdraw, for Richard's angry thrust Pierced through his side, and hurl'd him to the dust:
Yet fighting to the last, the vital breath He yields unwilling, and contends witb death. " Proud conqueror, lay me by my gallant boy, And thou, Mahommed, ope thy gates of joy." ec Eternal source of good!" the victor cries, As on the corse he fixed his thoughtful eyes, " Is there no mercy? shall the trumpet wake That gallant soul to haunt the penal lake? Alas! his hope is built on sand; his trust, Like Sodom's glittering fruit, shall fade in dust." 320 A shout arous'd him! from the citadel, On the glad breeze the notes of triumph swell; From its high towers, in conquering pride unroll'd, The red cross flames, the lion burns in gold; For Pardo by the stream's deserted bed With brave Thoulouse his bold Provencals led; Through frighted streets with eager haste they flew, Astonish'd all, dispers'd, o'erwhelm'd or slew. In vain the citadel her portals barr'd, They scaled the heights, o'erpower'd the feeble guard, And made it theirs, while all that should defend, Against the King their fruitless valour spend. But ah! while victory calls his careless host From Richard's side, shall Richard's self be lost?
A band of foes, that strove to force their way From the fall'n town, perceive the royal prey,— They thank their Prophet, from their phalanx spring, Enclose him round, and shout " the King! the King!"* te The King alone!" a voice familiar cried, i Young Pardo's blows the yielding train divide, 340?* He springs exulting to his sovereign's side. s His troop succeeds, again the war they wage, And, warm with fight, the yielding foe engage. Amid the ranks, all red with Christian blood, An Arab Prince, the bold Almanzor stood; The dark egret, whose jewell'd sprays were seen 'Mid the rich foldings of his turban green, Revealed his rank, while in that verdant hue \ Respectful slaves the Caaba's pilgrim knew; \ He struck the youth, and from his arm he drew 350^ A crimson current, bright as ever dyed The insect-laboured gem of Omar's tide. With toil, with joy exhausted, with the pain, Whose burning smart he never knew till then, He faints—the Monarch caught him in his fall, And, thus encumber'd, fights, and baffles all 1,* Historical.
He dreads no danger from th' unequal strife, And trembles only for his favourite's life. But soon that livid cheek was flush'd with shame, From Pardo's eyes indignant lightning came, 360 He starts, in haste he binds the bleeding wound, And wheels again his trenchant faulchion round; While Richard through the shrinking numbers flies, The great Almanzor singles and defies. Seldom had either met an equal foe; Careless at first they give the random blow, Then, by experience taught, rejoice to feel Their rival's worth, and summon all their skill. They strike, they turn, they bend; the fell intent Read in the eye,—they read it and prevent. 370 That scented scymitar of Syrian frame/ Swift, like the flash of Summer lightning came, Tough, supple, keen; but Richard's shield defied, Or Richard's cunning turn'd the stroke aside, Or impotent its baffled fury fell On the tough chainwork of his Norman mail. Not so the Monarch's sword, though shunn'd with care, Frequent its guiltless force was spent in air, Nor Asia's hardest steel, in happy hour, Temper'd with magic herbs and woidb of power, 380
Nor yet the Koran's holiest text, though brought Even from his Prophet's gifted tomb, and wrought By vestals on his silken vest, defends The bleeding flesh where Caliburn descends; And now, though stiff with gems and woven gold, It pierced the Mecca turban's verdant fold, Through the rich plaits the purple torrents flow, Almanzor reels, he falls beneath the blow. Who next shall bleed? lo! only Pardo near, Pours all his rapture in the Monarch's ear; 390 Now doubly joyous that his Sovereign's smile Approves his prudence, and rewards his toil. Nor with a fate less prosperous Albert waits Th' expected sally from the Patriarch's gates. Happy that Syrian who survived to tell To Asia's Monarch how his comrades fell! While o'er the heaps of dead the victors pour, Force back the closing gates, and win the tower. Nor less through Acre's streets, by Leicester led, The English host her desert homes invade, 400 Till all, or slain, or captive, own their power, Till Christian ensigns stream from every tower; Those walls that England conquer'd first, alone Her Lion-flag forgets to mark its own. vol. i. it
1 From what slight fault gigantic ills appear! For, like that little cloud the Prophet's prayer Called from the deep, that error shall expand, Till its black shadow darkens all the land. Slight is the joy that shines in smiles, alone, In silent tears is warmer rapture shewn: 410 But there's a higher agony of bliss, That knows nor tears nor smiles,—and such was this, Such Richard felt; —so many conflicts past, His prayer, his nightly dream fnl fill'd at last. And was She his, that city, dearly won As Jove-prop'd Ilion, she whose every stone Had cost a martyr's blood, whose impious pride For three long years the Christian world defied? Defiled the Cross, blasphemed each holiest name, And gave her captive foes to lingering flame \ e 420 In one long upward look his thanks were given, His silent gratitude communed with Heaven. Meanwhile with Saladine the heralds met, And vain demands drew on a vain debate; Till hark! that shriek from shuddering Islam sent! He draws the silken curtains of his tent,—
One look reveals the whole; his sickening sight Turns from that Cross on Acre's ramparts bright. That slow disease, still watchful for the hour When cankering cares the harass'd frame devour,430 Holds its permitted reign, and round their lord His servants tremble for a life adored. h Nor envious Philip read with less affright A rival's fame on every banner'd height; His avarice by that prompt success betray'd, His promised glories sunk in sudden shade. But Austria's crafty Duke, whose thirst of gold, His love, his hate, and even his fears controll'd, Resolves to share the spoil;—he calls his powers, Flies to the town, and mounts the conquer'd towers, And (for no banner there in mastery shone) His flag, presumptuous, marks them as his own. His troops, whose scanty hire but ill was paid,* For pillage ripe, his welcome call obey'd j With Bertrand join'd, their bloody way they force, And shrieks, and flames, and ruin mark their course.,и 2
But полу the King, attentive to lepair The yawning breach his fury batter'd there, Inspects th' Accursed Tower,—amazed, he knew The golden Larks upon their field of blue. 450 " What means this insult? By those powers that crown My conquering arms, I bid the pageant down! Say whence, proud Duke, this daring madness springs, To mate tby banner with the badge of Kings?' Even on this tower, beneath that conscious sun Which saw its ramparts by my valour won, Canst thou believe I tamely will behold Another's flag? the flag of Leopold? Sooth! were thine own Imperial Suzerain near, He well might dread to plant his eagle here. 460 Conrad alone, that Heaven and man defies,— But words are idle,—there thy banner lies!" Even as he spoke, beneath his sword it falls, Th' offending ensign tumbles from the walls; 'Mid heaps of carnage in the moat it roll'd, And dust and blood defiled the gaudy gold. In wonder speechless stood its raging lord, His threatening eyes flash fire, he grasps his sword. ** Hold! haughty Chief," again the Monarch spoke, " Nor farther yet my righteous ire provoke, 4J0
I dread thee not;—yet pardon if my tongue, By sudden anger moved, have done thee wrong. What though sole victor o'er this stubborn town, The glory is and shall be all my own; I know the rights of three long years of toil, And thou, and all, shall share her lawful spoil; But I endure no plunder—late I knew A lawless band, who bore thy cross of blue:— Recall them, for should one red hand be stain'd With needless blood, one sacred shrine profan'd, 480 By Heaven's bright throne, though Lydia's gold were there, And India's gems, that wealth they should not share." Many there are to dare, but not uphold The guilty deed, and such was Leopold. Brave as the best, if valour lie alone In shedding blood, or lavishing our own, Opinion bound him in her stern control, Nor he, like Conrad, ruled the shrinking soul. If ever worth or rank might envy claim, He envied Richard, long'd to blast his fame, 490 Yet dared not полу his kindled ire resent; Muttering and pale again he sought his tent. r 3
ί( Enjoy thy triumph, Prince! and think my hate Short as thy wrath, but thou shalt feel it yet; This outraged flag, which long my fathers bore, This outraged banner Austria bears no more.* What though in flowers I deign my sting to hide, 'Tis but more surely to abase thy pride; The shallow waters chafe, but where they sleep Lurks danger most, for they are dark and deep." 500 But now the King, for all alike prepared, Surveys the town, the towers, appoints the guard; Gracious to all, a just attention paid, Captive and friend, the dying and the dead. Freed from th* incumbent load, a warlike bier Now Rodney graced, and claim'd a passing tear; Twined round his mangled limb, the Monarch's eyes Itb azure cincture mark, and thus he cries: " Lo 1 first of those to whom that badge I gave, The gallant Rodney bears it to his grave: 510
Thus may ye live to glory,—thus may all In life adorn it, honour in their fall. But say—w r ho now the vacant prize shall grace, Who best deserves to fill a hero's place?— Thanks, my brave Peers, for this your silent voice, Those speaking looks that single out my choice. Pardo, if right thy generous heart I see, Nor rank nor riches have such charms for thee; This kindled envy once—young Knight, t'were wrotig, That heart like thine should strive with envy long;520 With thee our fame in Acre's fall is shared, Nor favour gives it, 'tis thy just reward. Long since my love had given, and love alone Deferr'd the guerdon, till thy worth had won." From his own knee meanwhile with ready hand He loosens, and presents the azure band. But Pardo's swelling heart no words supplied, "\ Kneeling he kiss'd the badge, and flew to hide \ The bursting stream of gratitude and pride. J " One debt remains," the generous Monarch said, " A Knight whose shield a clouded moon displayed, Whose legend mourn'd injustice—if severe His hurt forbid not, lead the warrior here." Borne on a litter came the wounded Knight, And shunn'd with downcast looks his Sovereign's sight. 4
CŒUR DE LION. »оок vi. But vainly he a well known face coneeal'd, The Monarch paus'd, then rais'd the pictur'd shield: ťí Say, my young friend, what clouds thy opening morn? What wrongs oppress, what injury hast thou borne? Why dost thou fight disguised? why leave behind 540 Thy train, nor give thy banner to the wind? Why not to me thy secret sorrows bring, And claim his ready justice from thy King?— Thou answer's^ not, De Carreo í must I then, Where I had hoped to praise, reprove agen? The forest laws my royal fathers framed, By tby rash youth were outraged, and I blamed: For this resign s't thou thy paternal state? Was I unjust } or think'st thou I forget The blood that from the Chiefs of Norway springs, Thy sires ennobled ere my own were Kings? Through whom my father's yoke proud Gwyneth bore, Through whom I rule Ierne's emerald shore; Thy noble parent, in whose guardian power My mother rests, and Windsor's regal tower? Or think'st thou I forget his loyal son Who for my menaced life exposed his own? Give mc thy banner j"—once again outspread, \ The silver saltier parts the sanguine red. > He lopp'd the pennon's forked points, 1 and said— 7
" Disdain not from a grateful Sovereign's hand A nobler banner, and enlarged command; To thee the fame of Othoer's race I trust: Now prove him false that called his King unjust."" " Now most unjust," the blushing youth replied, " My pride transgress'd, and thou reward'st my pride. What wond'rous power thy princely soul displays, With gifts to humble, with reproof to raise! How I receive the lesson, Sire, my speech Is poor to utter, but my life shall teach." 570 Faint he sunk back, the King's attentive mind To his own Leech th' exhausted Knight consign'd.* Then sought Almanzor's couch, whose desperate hand Tore from his bleeding brow the healing band: Unmoved by Ermengard, he mocks his prayers, His pious skill, and unrelaxing cares, And vows that never Infidel shall shed His hateful ointments on a Hadji's head.
ί( Brave Emir," spoke the King with generous heat, " I love that spirit, proudest in defeat; Yet for thy future fame consent to live, And ask whate'er a Monarch's power can give." 580 el What canst thou give, thou murderer of my fame, Thou canst not give me back a warrior's name! Yes! I will live, but live alone that thou May'st lie my thrall, as I before thee now; A living victim long thou should'st not be, I scorn thy mercies, Christian dog, and thee. Yet if thy words be not the idle breath Of one whose secret malice seeks my death, Send me to him I love, and Saladine Shall teach to quell that arm which humbled mine." tc So be it, Prince, as to thy grasp I yield This glove, my pledge to meet thee in the field, And on my casque thy proud egret will wear, } Nor wear dishonours; not thyself shall dare > To think it tarnish'd, when thou seest it there." J 'Tis night, and Pardo with a chosen power Protects the gate that leads from David's tower. The rising moon two female forms betray'd, Who linger'd near, and seem'd to court the shade;
Seized by his warriors, one of matron years, 600 Drops her coarse veil, and through contending tears Speaks of the robbers that had come by night, And insults to her child that counsel I'd flight. But accents gentle as the breeze that blows In amorous fragrance o'er the expanding rose, And sweet as murmurs of the streams that lave The frail Mimosa imaged in their wave, Reproving spoke:—" Dear guardian of my youth, Stoop'st thou to falsehood who hast taught me truth! Let guilt from fraud extort her poor defence, 610 But truth's the native guard of innocence. Oh, Knight! nor fear nor insult we endure, Still are the Haram's sacred bounds secure. The city's fate unknown, I calmly led Through folds of Syrian silk the golden thread, When shrieks of woe, resounding from the street, To the forbidden Golphor lured my feet. Alas í my sire, whose smile at eve and morn, Still told or promised of his safe return, Loav on a bier his senseless form was laid/ 620 With honour borne, yet honour'd as the dead; His bloody turban!—but I saw no more Till my thick veil my weeping damsels tore,
And said Almanzor lived; but hence removed To Kaisan's camp, nor nursed by those he loved. Can ev'n the generous Saladine supply A daughter's cares, or read the asking eye? Then blame not that, emboldened by despair, I bade my nurse two barracans prepare,* Such as befit our meanest slaves alone, 630 So might we pass, I deem'd, unmark'd, unknown: But ah! how helpless and how weak a flower Is woman when she quits her guardian bower! Oh, let me seek its sacred walls again, To weep I left them, since I left in vain." " No, not in vain! behold a loyal knight Kneels at thy feet, and vows to aid thy flight; I grant thy wish, for I believe thy tale, Yet drop, one instant drop, that envious veil. Perchance (and I methinks should bless the hour) 640 The fate of war may lead me to thy bower; Warriors are rude when rushing from the field, And I would know thy beauties but to shield,"
As shone the moon, then bursting from a cloud, So dawn'd Amina from her sable shroud. 'Tis not the diamonds in her raven hair, Or the strung jasmine wreath'd in contrast there, The golden links that round her ancles hung, The belt of perfume o'er her shoulder flung,* Her jewell'd caftan, or her shawl of gold, 650 That the gay youth in mute enchantment hold; But that fine form that match'd the palm in height, Firm as the cedar, as the acacia light; Those eyes, in which a chastened spirit dwells, Mild as the dove's, yet bright as the gazelle's. Perchance her cheek too warm a glow had won From the keen ray of Yemen's fervid sun, Yet o'er its charms the vivid blush that broke, Outvied Damascus' rose, when thus she spoke: " Not far are those who if this scene they guest, Might deem their daggers' fittest sheath my breast; Yet think not I a spotless fame despise, ~\ If at thy suit I drop my dark disguise, > Nor worse than death abhor a stranger's eyes. j
Though now adorn'd with every Syrian art, To lure a master's gaze, not touch his heart; Such were not once my cares," she paus'd and sigh'd, tc Ere I was destined for Moheddin's bride: The new restraint my liberal soul disdains, For I was nurs'd on Yemen's happy plains, 670 Free as the soaring bird, the mountain gales, Or streams that leap, rejoicing, to the vales. My ardent spirit, from my dear kitarr Delights to call the inspiring strains of war, Or warriors' loves, but sickens when I suit Voluptuous accents to the Persian lute. I love to bend the bow, to urge the chase, And on th' unsaddled courser win the race; To dress my father's meal, and twine at eve Those webs tha* only Arab maids can weave ý 680 Where towering date-trees shade the saffron mead, m And tents are pitch'd, and peaceful camels feed j But weep, now doom'd to waste the breezy morn In joyless splendour, and in arts I scorn. Perchance in Syria yet my soul retains The Grecian fire that warm'd my mother's veins! The ire that kindled when she told her doom; Snatch'd by the ruthless Tartars from her home,
In a rude sack borne o'er the burning sand, And sold, half-lifeless, to a stranger's hand." 690 But steps approach s"— she ceased, and closely drew The veil which Rezia o'er her features threw. ťc Be swift," cried Pardo, " bring my stoutest steed, Watch well the portal, I return with speed: For thee, bright damsel, I transgress, nor pause To risk my fame in beauty's sacred cause, Nor fear a generous King the deed will chide; To friendly hands I pledge me now thy guide; But duty then requires to break the spell, And my reluctant lips must breathe farewell." 700 Soon on the steed the grateful dames he placed, Unbarred the gates and led them forth in haste. By this the moon withdrew her guiding light, The dark dense vapours blot th' etherial height, From Carmel's brow the pealing thunders roar, And the full clouds their angry torrents pour. Unused to Nature's frown, Amina's breast Heaves with the fears she check'd, but scarce supprest. And Pardo, filtering in a doubtful track, Thinks how his Sovereign's trust commands him back, When sudden by th' electric flash was shewn A warrior near, iu armour, but alone.
" Whoe'er thou art, for by this fitful light III may I read thy lofty crest aright, Now by thy spurs, I bid thee aid the fair! Now for the love of holy knighthood swear, Ere Carmel's brow with orient crimson shine, To lead these Arab maids to Saladine." rt In simple faith the precious charge to guide Be mine," the youth in Eastern speech replied. /20 " Though I, uncall'd, assume the knightly crest, Believe that honour fills an Arab's breast; I will not sue to hear that maiden's tale, Or see one eye beneath her half-raised veil." i£ And wilt thou leave me," sigh'd the trembling fair, " And leave me thus, beneath a stranger's care?" " Alas! sweet maid, may ne'er thy tender heart Be torn like mine,—unwilling I depart. Thy charms this night have lured me to forget A duty that was never irk i/ise yet; 730 While back to Acre's joyless walls it leads, My thoughts will linger where Amina treads."— "Thus, then," sheanswered, ťí if wc here must sever, Thus, like this jasmine, and, alas! for ever, At least forget not ere its bloom decline The maid w hose heart shall аоге each word of thine."
Then drooping her fair head, she parts in haste The fragrant blossoms on her bosom placed; And had a ray been there, th' enamour'd Knight Had found a tear upon its starry white. 740 " No, till my death thy memory will be sweet, If—but brave Arab we at least shall meet; Ere this I should have ask'd with timely fear, Thy name, and what thy secret purpose here." (i My name I tell not полу, but thou may'st guess My daring hope, that, careless in success, Some ilb-watch'd fort might yield our valour way, And night reverse the glories of the day.— I hoped in vain—farewell, till time shall shew Thy faithful friend, at least thy generous foe; 7^0 My blue egret shall mark me in the field."— " And me the milkwhite gauze that veils my shield," Rejoin'd young Pardo, as with hasty tread And sinking heart he left the weeping maid. Scarce on his midnight watch again he stood When Albert came, and mark'd his musing mood. '* What! my best friend, my Pardo, art thou sad, (Thou ever gay I) when all around are glad? VOL. I. fc.
If budding honour thus tby spirit tame, Heaven shield thee from thy growing weight of fame! Come, I must rob thee of this gate's command, Thy last night'» toii, thy wound, this rest demand; Go to thy couch—nay, why that louring brow, Thou prompťst the taunt I never thought till now: I will not say 'tis deep, but there is one Who loves thee as thou wert indeed his son; How would he grieve to see thy spirit lost, How mark that sigh! Come, I must have thy post. Thine is an eye that knows the spells of sleep, We love-lorn souls, thou say'st, but watch and weep; If we must watch, it little matters where— Richard and Love's commands alike I bear; Yield to whichever shall р!еазе thy fancy best, Thy friend's intreaty, or thy King's behest." " To both," he cried, " and leave to thee the light, Thy laughing brow has stolen from mine to night j It may be that I feel a wound forgot, That I am weary, though I knew it not." But what bright image haunts his heated brain, And frights that slumber, ne'er implored in vain? 780 " An infidel, another's destined bride, I could not love, if love were mine," he cried.
" What witchery this? our ghostly legends tell, That Demons oft in angel semblance dwell j Yet, though I perish, ne'er can I believe Her words unholy—that those looks deceive." But hark! that distant strain,—the stormy night Stills her rude blasts, and listens with delight. In stoles whose rich embroidery sweeps the ground, With censers breathing sacred odours round; 790 With tapers far their holy light revealing, With solemn music on the darkness stealing; With waving palms that fresher gales diffuse, And cleanse each shrine with consecrated dews, Sage Hubert speeds, amid his priestly train, Chaunts the high mass, and lustrales every faue. To Christian rites each blessed dome return'd, To every Saint the votive incense burn'd, And monarchs kneel, while zealous prelates raise The notes of triumph, piety and praise. 800 How rarely thus, with flowers that never fade, Religion's amaranth wreaths the CoNauEBoa's blade! Those lofty strains o'er Pardo's restless mind Breathed a pure calm, ennobled and refined: Yet though to prayer his inmost soul was given, Amina mingled with his thoughts of heaven; s 2
Bright as she shone in Cynthia's silver beams, The angel vision cheers his broken dreams. Far other orgies, other sounds than those, From Carmel's dark divan of demons rose; 810 Abortive guile, and baffled hate were there, Contention, fury, weakness and despair.— Each blames his fellows, each himself extols, Th' infernal throng Alkarmel scarce controuls. " What madness, Genii, what blind rage is ours! Our safety hangs not on yon conquer'd towers. The wrecks of storm-tost barks that strew the main, The steams of death that rise from Acre's plain, Yon blighted fields, yon heaps of ashes tell How duly each has labour'd, and how well. 820 Say next, what evils can our hate conspire, By fraud, by force, by famine, plague or fire? The Pest has fell'd whom swords assail'd in vain— Speak, shall the deadly vapours rise again? Their course to govern, their success to cçe, Superb Moozallil, were a feast for thee."— " No! not for me, abhorr'd Alkarmel!—ask Thyself or Ullah for so mean a task.
Her toad-like spirit would delight to sip The last blue venom from each livid lip. 830 She smiles when by disease the peasant dies, I joy alone in higher agonies;— Guilts's labouring throes, the Hell of vain remorse, And hate, and virtue writhing at its force. Vile as the beasts they rode, th' imperial band Might wait for thee, I lopp'd the master hand— Not I Comnenus' craven soul controlled, But the fierce Conrad, Bertrand, Leopold, These are my slaves, and Richard's, groans shall tell My skill directs their deadly malice well. 840 The arrow from a foe would scarce offend, Infernal hatred points it by a friend. 'Tis like that icy wind, whose odorous breath Shall woo man's helpless race to drink their death; * Or like those scented blades of Syrian steel, Whose venom'd fragrance aids their power to kill. Talk not of hope, from us for ever fled, The truly brave fight on when hope is dead: Let Adam's sons her baseless visions trust, Richard must triumph, aud ye know he must; 850,s О
But let us keep him from the rich repast, And drug the nectar he must drink at last."— " And how?" cried Ullah, (i not by idle words, The sole resource Moozallil's wit affords!"— *' Peace, murmurer! do not these contentions tell That discord is the deadliest curse of Hell? Still in the Christian host the fiend shall reign, Their efforts palsy,—make success their bane. Let this suffice, nor farther seek to know, Till Palestine in shrieks announce the blow."— 860 " But who shall match Plantagenet? for death," Mordash began, C( arrests the Soldan's breath." " Restore him—Asia from her terrors freed Shall thank her Prophet for the specious deed; Such task befits Maimoune's gentle mood— She loves the guilt tbat wears the mask of good." At this her form assumed a lovelier grace, A smile just lighten'd on her pensive face; On roscai«* 1 clouds she flies, while deeper hate And deadlier scorn on each swart visage sate. 870 As fades the moon, with wizard gloom o'erspread, So darkness deepen'd,, when the Peri fled; Loud rose the voice of wrath, red lightnings glare And all the furies fright the troubled air.
What spell arrests the storm? below, around, More felt than heard, and yet it seem'd a sound. At once they pause, their inward fears betray, And curse that call they dare not disobey; While low to earth the abject spirits bow, And silence reigns where Etna raged but now. 880 Alone Moozallil stands erect,—his eye Shoots angry flames, he mocks them as they fly. " False to yourselves as to your God, away! Lo Hassan calls, and Hassan's slaves obey! Hence I lest th' Assassin Prince infuriate rise, And dare arraign the children of the skies; Lest on some icy peak he bid you pine, Or deep in earth, in riven rocks confine. Go! ye that fear a mortal; doubly curst í Bound to those spells your folly taught him first. 890 Go! reckless now of your ætherial birth, To Heaven rebellious, yet the slaves of earth. For this ye lost the skies; ye would not bow To man when sinless, yet ye serve him now! Be Heaven or Hell my lot—delight, disgrace, I make no compact with the hated race.",s 4
Meanwhile Maimoune sought th' Ascanian wave, Whose limpid tides her fair pavilion lave. Oft when at noon th' unrippled face is clear, Through the blue glass the fairy halls appear, 900 White as those fanes that time and man defy, Nor rue one stain from Grecia's lovely sky. O'er half the lake the beauteous vision spreads, Rich gilded domes, and marble colonnades; While mortals, wandering on the shadowy shore, Mourn for the buried palaces of yore.* Here shells in mockery match the frailer flowers That lend their beauty to our earthly bowers, Soft banks of moss serenest sleep bestow, And fragrant rills in soothing murmurs flow. 910 Nor lack'd there tenderer blossoms, such as give Th' ambrosial scents by which the Perics live; While all around, in rich profusion strown, 'Mid orient pearls the blushing coral shone;
Th' amber's liquid light, and many a gem, Rare as the boast of Stamboul's diadem. Maimoune snatch'd a vase; in Paradise Once had its radiance pleased celestial eyes, And now, though sullied by her guilty touch, Its light transcends the gems of earth as much 920 As Heaven's inferior angels would outshine Those charms in Carmel's synod held divine. Within that shrine of sunny topaz beams A lucid wave from Eden's sainted streams, With whose blest drops the Peri every day Wash'd from her brow the stains of earth away· And now, as she through night's calm æther flew, Pleased with her task, and conscious that she drew From that good office, from the vase she bore, Charms, since her loss of Heaven unknown before; Flowers from her waving tresses load the wind, A wake of light and perfume spreads behind, And from her lips such magic notes distil, That Moslems deem them strains of israfil.*
Where faint and pale, scarce conscious of the sound Of weeping friends and Imaums chaunting round, The Soldan lay,—»her radiant presence sent Soft light and freshening odours through the tent; And as above his wasted form she bent, Scarce her mild eye severer sadness shews 940 Than pitying seraphs feel for human woes, While from her hand Heaven's own sweet dewdrops came, Smoothed his distorted brow, and cooled his frame. Such magic drops, as Grecian poets tell, From young Aurora's rosy fingers fell; Nor more reviving those ambrosial showers To Tempe's drooping shrubs and faded flowers; Nor yet Mahommed's wounded, weary crew, From Gilead's balm diviner virtue drew, When at his prayers (for so the Suras feign) 950 The healing grove sprung up on Mecca's plain,*
Than from those blessed drops, indeed divine, Flow'd through the wasted frame of Saladine. Nor warm with life, witb health renew'd he seems, Rose with the sun, and blest his golden beams.,END OF BOOK VI.

CŒUR DE LION.,BOOK VII.,THE MARCH TO ARSOUF. Nor vain Moozallil's threats: where'er it fell His torch awaked the latent fires of Hell! Till all who fought for Acre's towers erewhile, Like ravening vultures now contest her spoil. At length a seeming calm succeeds the storm, And fiendish malice wears a fairer form. With faltering voice, slow step, and visage pale, The specious Philip gilds his artful tale, How the long toils his pristine strength overcame, And Asia's sun unnerved his northern frame. 10
" Brother of England! comrade of my youth! With soul propitious hear the voice of truth. The city's fall acquit> my vow; the gales With favouring breath invite me to Marseilles: Weak as I am, I yet my course delay, Nor heave one anchor, if thou bid'st me stay. Oh I had I lived unwedded to a throne, Drown a free sword, and fought for fame alone, Not life or Europe proffer aught so dear As for the Cross to fight and perish here! 20 But since I more the Christian weal can aid In France a monarch than in Asia dead, I bow to Heaven, I seek th' inglorious West, And leave the wrongs of Sion unredrest; Doom'd, when thy triumph rescued realms proclaim, To curb the jealous pang, and bless thy fame. Yet,—for my pious zeal unwilling draws One active weapon from the sacred cause,— Ten thousand spears, the choicest of my train, To aid your arms in Otho's care remain. 30 Then prove, my friend, though policy or pride Have sever'd those in happier youth allieu, That, like the nectar in its bloomy cells, Deep in our hearts one drop of sweetness dwells;
. These chiefs have seen our discord, let them see Thou hold' s t my life as dear as thine to rae" a He spoke:—not oft to Richard's generous breast Suspicion came, or came a welcome guest; Yet when hi» rival, with such vain parade, Asserts a friendship he so oft betray'd, 40 Distrust awakes, he ьееь the covert snare, And feels for England's weal a sovereign's care. ťf I too, Augustus, have been taught to feel How ill these feeble bodies serve our zeal: Thus ever, when an arm of flesh we trust, We find th' important lesson, man is dust! Our early love was like a golden chain, Not lightly broke, nor broken, join'd again. If rivalry could here our souls inflame, Here, where our hope, our interest was the same, 50 Will fair occasion interdict the wrong? Will distance make expiring friendship strong ï Then pardon, Philip, if I bid thee stay, Again to pledge the vows of Vezelay/'— Those vows, that even from a rival's hand Demand the care of my unguarded land." " And fear'st thou, Richard, I would forfeit troth? Then fear no longer: 1 renew my oath j vol. ι. τ
So thou before these Princes yield again A vassal's fealty for thy Norman reign." 60 But Richard, reading through the thin disguise The wish to sink him in his comrade's eyes, Paus'd not an instant; kneeling on the sand, His sword he tenders to his Suzerain's hand."* " For ducal Normandy, and Acquitaine, Touraine and Poitou, half thine ample reign, I render homage here; but England's throne, 4 Erin and Gwyneth, by my father won, f And Cyprus' conquer'd vales are mine, and mine i alone." J The chiefs in wonder heard the King display 70 The various regions that confest his sway, When Conrad rose, and with unbending look, Disdaining art, in open scorn he spoke: £( Warriors farewell í I pray not for your weal, I feign no friendship that I do not feel; Nor courage fails me, nor my scrip is low, Nor ape I sickness, 'tis my will to go.>—
For thee, О chief! I spread no artful gloze, No love has bound us, and we may be foes, Since thou permitt'st yon phantom king to wear 80 My lawful title, and my standard bear. Nor think by words my purpose to restrain, I lack not gold, and flattery I disdain; Oh! may you mourn me, as th' Achaian host In blood and fire once mourn'd Pelides lost." They spoke and parted;—long with pain supprest, Indignant virtue blazed in Richard's breast. i( Hence, hence, ye recreants! ye that vow'd to bleed For Sion's love, yet leave her towers unfreed! Hence, for if interest lures, or fear appals, ЯО Ye are not worthy to behold her walls! c The God of Truth a livelier faith demands, And scorns the labour of reluctant hands." Now with redoubled zeal he bends bis care The walls to strengthen, and the towers repair; The ransom'd captives to their homes restor'd, \ While those deserted by their cruel lord > Paid the dire forfeit of his broken word. 4 } Then to the Templars, bravest of the brave, The conquer'd town, important trust! he gave; 100 τ 2
And bids his knights (nor were th^y loth) prepare For the long march, the toils and wounds of war, To quit her glittering domes, her citron shades, And the soft converse of her dark-eyed maids. But first from Acre to the Tyrian court The Austrian Duke, and proud Beauvais resort; Beauvais, who ere his limbs the hauberk wore, The pastoral staff and golden mitre bore. Them, charged with courteous speech, the Monarch sent, So might, perchance, the angry chief repent, 110 And Philip, still in friendly Tyre confined By adverse ocean, or his wavering mind. e ({ He \vho restrain'd the west'ring sun," he said, " And through the parted waves his chosen led, Again may open yon ætherial realm, With stones or fire an impious race to whelm; Yet wills not that presumptuous man despise The licens'd means his narrow skill supplies," Meanwhile the pilgrim host their course began; f First rode D'Avesnes, and either Lusignan, 120 The Templars, (all that Acre's safety spared), And brave Toulouse, for every chance prepared.
Next with the centre royal England came j There round their King the glancing pennons flame; There from its towery height the standard flow'd, And princely dames on gentle palfreys rode. Otho, behind, th' Ausonian force commands, The Gallic chivalry, and Austrian bands j With him, in robes of glittering scarlet, moved The Champions of the Tomb, in combat proved. 130 Arm'd with their bows the yeomanry attend, And, sheathed in stubborn mail, the flanks defend; 8 While proudly riding o'er the purple tide, The copious fleet each rising want suppUed. h The air was calm, and every hill around Sent joyful echoes to the trumpet's sound; The morn was bright, and every golden ray Wanton'd 'mid tossing plumes and banners gay; The winding Belus past, and Menmon's tomb, And Kishon's stream, and Carmel's brow of bloom, And Shafamora, that sequester'd lies Beneath green ridges that successive rise To princely Lebanon, whose peaks of snow Shine o'er her dusky wilderness below; 'Mid many a fragrant herb they wander on Through the delightful plains of Zàbulon. тЗ
'Twas sultry noon,—'twas August,—yet the breeze From the tall hills, the near though hidden seas, Blew fresh and cool, while through the livelong day A thousand beauties cheat the weary way; 150 Around profuse the purple thistle grew,* That clothes whole regions in its gorgeous hue; While Nature's hand, eternal wonder! weaves A holy legend in its dappled leaves: Like that bright flower which still (as bards have sung) Laments the hero from whose blood it sprung;— That, the sad record of a heathen's shame— But this, of heavenly love and mercy's healing stream.f The yellow cassia, with its rich perfume, The cistus, lavish of its shortlived bloom, 160 Type of man's hopes, all lovely at their birth, But falling with the slightest touch to earth;
A race as fair the next blythe morning weaves, And woos th' expecting gatherer, and deceives. There too that tree, whose rosy blossoms flame, As blushing to record a traitor's name; The name of him to self-destruction led' In vain repentance for his Lord betrayed. There loaded palms and ripening vines between The tall opuntia rears its prickly screen, I7Ö And round each ample leaf its flowers unfold Their rich festoons of crimson and of gold j* And there that cane, whence sweeter juice distils Than bees collect on Hybla's thymy hills. Ill fated plant î for man's delight design'd, But made by man the scourge of half his kind. How blest had ne'er a Norman ruler's hand, Pour'd the new nectar on Sicilia's strand! Thrice blest, had ne'er Iberian sails unfurPd, With this dire gift to curse th' Atlantic world. 1 180 All lovely yet appear'd that chosen land,'" Despite of war and Islam's iron hand. With awe they tread where e'en th' unconscious sod Was dear to memory, sacred to their God. Yet oh! how much more fragrant and more fair, When his celestial presence wander'd there! τ 4
When earth, delighted, round his infant head Bade virgin flowers delicious odours shed; When serpents died, and every herb of ill, And native harvests redden'd every hill; 190 The thorny brakes with ruddy grapes were fiU'd, And the rough oaks a honied dew distill'd.* At Cana now the pilgrims pause, where first From the gross veil the present Godhead burst; Where, while through every heart amazement rush'd, " The conscious water saw its God and blush'd." Next at Saphura, reverend in decay, To Anna's shrine their duteous homage pay. n Till one fair eve, while lavish dews descend, And the clear stars attemper'd radiance lend, 200 Where the tall plane-trees join'd the acacia's shade, And through the turf a crystal fountain play'd, King Richard pitch'd his camp, and all around Ten thousand tents coneeal'd the dusty ground. In haste the troops regale; with toil opprest They laid the helmet by, and sunk to rest. * Ipsa tibí blandos fundent cunabula flores. Occidet et serpens, et ŕaílax herba yeneni Occidet; ***** Molli paullaíi/n flavescet campus arista, IncultİMjııe rubens pendebit sentibus uva; Et duræ querei» sudabunt roscìda mella.
But, lured by silver Cynthia's rising beam, Round the green margin of the gurgling stream, The knights and damsels court the evening breeze; Of their rich burthen rob the bending trees, 210 On saffron turfs the rural banquet spread, *\ Or the cool tamarind's grateful acid shed ч In the clear nectar from the fountain head. 0 * While Richard with his bride discours'd apart, Each sought the lady dearest to his heart. Flung on a mossy bank, young Raymond seems To count the murmurs of the lucid streams, But love was conscious of a sweeter spell, Where on the waves Matilda's image fell; Evanthe sought behind a leafy screen 220 A shadowy spot, where she might weep unseen; Near the pale heliotrope, whose flower with pain Turns to the sun, and loves, like her, in vain/ Nor heeds that Lusignan's enchanted soul Mark'd each bright tear that o'er her beauty stole. In sooth each knight some soft attraction found, Yet hid in fair excuse the chain that bound: One loved the opening of a laurel glade, 4 One the broad sycamore's majestic shade; \ But each, the spot where sate his favourite maid.230^
Gay Hermesind, amid the moonbeam's glare, Drew all the youthful and the joyous there; Soft flattery, breathing from the careless heart, Or sighing slaves that dare not own their smart, Bids on her blushing cheek new graces rise, And calls fresh lustre from her laughing eyes. With playful wit she points her conscious charms, Fair, and capricious as those airy forms, That where the moon shines clear, and brighter springs Th' autumnal verdure, weave their mushroom rings, And quit the lily's spacious bell, to tread Their midnight mazes on th' enamell'd mead. Apart from all she mark'd the Knight Unknown, Propp'd on his ample shield, his vizor down, And as she spoke, with arch coquettish grace Flung back the roseate gauze that veil'd her face. i( Why does the Knight of Solitude disdain To mingle with Diana's vestal train? Now by thy grassy plume and emerald shield, By those coy lips in scornful silence seal'd, 250 Approach our ring; 'tis not the tell-tale noon, And vestal's veils are lifted to the moon." " Nay, lady! point not thus, nor thus intreat— I may not fill that envied, dangerous seat;
For oft, 'tis said, 'mid honour's deathless leaves, If subtle love his fragrant roses weaves, With hue less bright the glossy laurels shine, Fade at his touch, and like the flowers decline. While Salem's throne the bold Amalric claim'd, While Baldwin ruled, this shadowy grove was famed; At earliest summer, round this sacred spring, His nobles wont tojóin Judea's King;* They met, on fire for glory, prompt to ride 'Gainst Sanguin's force, or tame Noureddin's pride. What fitter spot can hear the vows of one, Whose heart now beats at honour's voice alone. See, as I dipp'd my falchion in the stream, The moonlight touch'd it with propitious beam; I will not fear that e'en thy looks have shed A softer power to enervate the blade; 270 Yet not too long I trust that witching eye, I know my danger, and have strength to fly." Piqued at his coldness, vowing that his heart Should yet be hers if she had charms or art,
She ponder'd on his words, and vainly tried To pierce the secret sense they seem'd to hide. (The voice, through the barr'd vizor heard alone, Nor yet familiar seem'd, nor quite unknown.) With seeming triumph in her looks, the while She blest Ricardo with her sweetest smile. 280 " Lo! he hath spoken—some few trials past Shall find this Orson humanized at last." Then glancing round: " How sweet these moonlight shades, How blest the lot of Syria's happy maids! No toils are theirs, no care but to enjoy All art can give, beneath so pure a sky; Where nature, prodigal of bounty, yields All bards have fabled of Elysian fields."— ťť Ah!" Pardo cried, " can Syria's daughters be The source of envy to a maid like thee! 290 Will Hermesind confess her eyes require The jetty cohol to enhance their fire? Or would she brook to waste a morning's care, The jasmine twining in her sable hair, While stiff with gems her radiant vesture shone, To please one cold or jealous eye alone?
No! for she emulates that orb divine Whose sultry beams on all creation shine, And brighter arms her eyes' destructive ray, As more sad victims droop beneath their sway." 300 " Nay! scoffing is not safe! some luckless hour E'en thy cold breast may melt in beauty's pow'r."— Her words aroused a serpent at his heart, Yet his gay brow refused to own the smart. ťí Aye, nymph! but never will I bend to one Who loves to break all hearts, but pities none; That like the fen-fire shines but to beguile, Death in her frown, and treachery in her smile; Though thou hast brighter lips, and cheeks, and eyes, Than grace the bowers of Moslem Paradise, 310 If such the heaven thou seek'st to gain, beware; Mahommed paints his houris kind as fair."— But Albeit, silent on a bank reclined, In fancy's glass compares each damsel's mind. Some flowers there are so delicately bright Their leaves expand but to meridian light, And drink, where most Hyperion's fervours stream, With eagle gaze the fullness of his beam; And such was Hermersind, whose beauty shone In the broad sunshine of a court alone, 320
Where, while around imperial splendour plays, Her eye might bask in, and reflect the blaze. While pale Evanthe, gentle, anxious maid, A pensive violet in its leafy shade, Though from that sun her light of life she drew, Dares not on him to lift her timid view; Yet far unlike the cloister's pallid maids, Or flowers that open as the daylight fades, With charms half lost amid the doubtful light, And incense wasted on th' unconscious night: 330 Her' s was no useless bloom, no lavish'd balm, She sought the lowly dell, the shadowy calm; Yet smiling in the sun, serene in showers, That crush'd or blasted, gayer, prouder flowers, In weal or woe her sweetness would impart, To please the joyous, cheer the drooping heart. " But," thought he, as his mind the theme pursues, ¿And from the scene imbibes its eastern hues, " What flower is she that in her lonely dell Droops mournful now, my own sweet Rosabelle? 340 Ah! when, loved blossom, shalt thou cease to mourn? When shall thy wandering nightingale return? " Now gentle sleep each sparkling eye deprest And rich pavilions tempt to balmy rest:
For Europe's scanty tents were laid aside, And Western warriors loved Arabian pride, To see rich carpets on the turf unroll'd, And every damask curtain loop'd with gold; While flowery wreaths their midnight scents exhale, And perfumed waters cool the sultry gale. 350 They loved whate'er of gorgeous and of gay Might shed a grace o'er battle's stern array. Yet ere the East proclaimed the rising sun, The tents were lifted and the march begun. Beneath their feet profuse that lily springs Whose golden bloom outvies the robe of kings, 4 And the pale star, by pious pilgrims named From that whose beams a Saviour's birth proclaim'd. r But when at noon the heavy casque opprest, In Nazareth's consecrated shades they rest; 360 Their golden beads with pious reverence tell, And slake their ardour at the Virgin's well. Still with the dawn Arabian maidens bring Their thirsty vases to the sacred spring, But all unconscious of its ancient fame, They breathe no humble prayer to Mary's name; No shrine records where once a Saviour trod, And gladden'd earth confest the infant God.
Now through Esdrælon's smiling vale they crost, Where Cesarea awes the rocky coast. 370 They halt—but none their conquering course oppose, And at their call the friendly gates unclose. An ample guard the Monarch leaves behind; Then as through Arsouf s rocky vale they wind He counsels caution. Melting in the sky, No more the vast horizon shuns the eye; Not this fair Zabulon's delightful plain, Here ambush'd fraud might lurk, nor lurk in vain/ Where to the south, the angry seas enclose, And to their left the heights of Napolose -, 380 While in the narrow space that wound between Frowns many a broken rock and deep ravine. Here torrents cut the path, here rampant grass, And towering reeds betray the near morass. Nor false the leader's fears—from every height Soon flew the deadly shafts in frequent flight; From mighty blocks of weather-tinctured stone, That seem'd in wrath by warring Titans thrown On the crush'd forest, start the wary foes, From each green tuft, each Avail, each hollow, rose; Each little hamlet seems a fortress now, No spot is safe, no step without a blow.
Where each rude fragment is a post to gain, Where not one stream is passed till choked with slain. Strange to the ground, with practi&ed foes they meet, Prompt in advance and prompter in retreat; Who see the Christians with their darts perplext, Then quit this lair and wait them from the next; While still the broken ground forbids to close, Nor day brings safety, nor the night repose. 400 In vain is force before a viewless foe, Or prudence, levelfd by a random blow; No space is theirs to charge or to career, Skill, valour, strength, alike are frustrate here. At length a hoary wood the heights o'erspread j ч With caution due the harass'd host survey'd, V And hope for safety in its friendly shade; y Yet deeply marvel that the Soldan's care, Of late so wakeful, plants no ambush there! The hasty trench is dug, the frequent stroke 410 Fells for the solid fjence the knotty oak, While the lopp'd branches, heap'd in many a pjre, Prepare to guard the forest camp with fire. One half the host their anxious vigils keep, Stretched on their arms, the rest solicit sleep. vol. i. и
But ьооп their minds disastrous thoughts invade, With withering hue they scan the wond'rous shade; What though no mighty stems, luxuriant, wove Their boughs umbrageous, patriarchs of the grove, The tninkswere white with age, with moss o'ergrown, Deform'd, and struggling with th' incumbent stone. Not like those woods where Nature's hand profuse A thousand forms displays, a thousand hues, Where all the children of the hill combine; Nor like those stately sheets of towering pine Whose graceful pyramids on Jura rise, And blend her misty summits with the skies:— One rounded dwarfish form, one sullen leaf, Clothes the'wide forest in perennial grief; One leaf that, when the naked Winter mourns, 430 Fades not, nor brightens when the Spring returns.' In vain their foes have fled the fatal wood, No rest they found, by deadlier ills pursued. Fiends, that to grieve the noble Tancred there, Could erst the form of armed Clorinda bear, Or wore Armida's smiles, but wore in vain, Send the loud shriek, and clank the heavy chain. Cold poisonous serpents hiss along the ground, The vulture screams, the lion roars around,
And ever where the thickest branches play'd 440 His dreadful eyes are twinkling in the shade. With naked swords the affrighted warriors hear, Their snorting steeds are bathed in dews of fear \ In vain industrious hands provoke the fire, The rebel flames in dust and blood expire. With sad funereal sound the moaning breeze Swells to a storm, and bends the stubborn trees; The thunder roars, the forked flash appals, And sanguine rain, that blisters where it falls; To each scared wretch his ghastly comrade seems 450 Like those pale forms that haunt distemper'd dreams. Loud scream'd the owl, the raven croaking flew, E'en darkness wore a strange unnatural hue, And her black void is fill'd with shapes of woe; Terrific sights, that day shall never know. Now valour falters,—they that proudly bore The brunt of battle, are themselves no more; Fearless alone, Plantagenet imparts His own brave spirit to their sinking hearts; Cheers, strengthens all—till now at random thrown On a vast slab of dark and rugged stone, Beyond that joyless scene his fancy soars, Reviews the past, the future page explores; и '2
When lo! a blaze of fiercer lightning came, The wood is radiant with a lambent flame; Shrill shrieks succeed,—Evanthe pale, aghast, Bursts through the adverse boughs and rushes past; Foaming with rage, a ravenous beast pursued, And dreadful roarings echo through the wood; From its broad shoulders streamed its shaggy hair,470 And its red eyes with rage portentous glare. No time to seek the spear or draw the blade, Dauntless he rushed to screen the affrighted maid; O'er his stout arm his velvet mantle wound, And, undismayed, receives the dreadful bound; Huge claws and gnashing teeth in vain assail, Entangled, blunted by his woven mail; Till, as more wide the furious jaws expand, Down the fell throat he thrusts his mighty hand. Tears with resistless force its heart away, 480 And far before him casts the lifeless prey. u Evanthe next he seeks,—with 'wildered look Her slender arms entwined a rugged oak; But, with the weight of gratitude opprest, She comes, she falls on her deliverer's breast. Loose are her tresses, bare her rounded arms, Their faded hue gives interest to her charms,
Till, as new light inspires her opening eyes, On her pale features burning blushes rise, And, starting from his hold, she strives to hide 490 Her glowing face, and sinks at Richard's side. " Oh! why again so generous? wherefore save A wretch, whose only hope is now the grave? Why, why for me so dear a life expose? Too well, alas! this wretched bosom knows, Too deeply feels the gratitude it owes." Astonished at her words, perplexed, amazed, Reproving, pitying half, the Monarch gazed, While o'er his soul, but whence he knew not, came The fascination of that mystic dream, 500 Which, when he slumber'd in th' expiring storm, In added grace fore?hewed the stranger form. But soon his better thoughts the spell resist, He answer'd calm, as though his ear had miss'd The sense of words by strong emotion wrung, Unknown, at least unbidden from her tongue. "Nay, rate not thus," he spoke, * 4 illustrious maid! So slight a service,—in itself repaid. Thou tremblest yet!—let Berengaria's care Thy terrors soothe, thy harass'd frame repair. 510 ü3
Rise, Princess, nor disdain the aid I lend, My arm shall guide thee to thy gentle friend. (i To her, beloved of Richard, shall I go, And bid her, as she caused, enjoy my woe? No, first, inhuman! shed ray vital blood, Or give me to the monsters of the wood. Rent from a crown, myself, my sire a slave, I bore resign'd,—I loved thee, and forgave; I loved, I saw thee wed another bride, And lived, alas! to wish I then had died. 520 Now self-betray'd—ah! whither shall I fly? How meet thine own, or Berengaria's eye! Oh! hide me in some cave, where none that knew Her happier days, Evanthe's grief can view; Some spot (if such there be) where never fame With joyful tongue shall whisper Richard's name; There shall cold vigils waste my youthful prime, And tears efface th' involuntary crime: Or rather, since those frowning looks disclose Far less than pity for thy victim's woes, 530 Now let me quit this load of life, and find, Chief of the iron-heart, this steel more kind."
(t Hear not, ye Heavens!" cried Richard, as he sprung, And from her hand the lifted dagger flung. " Alas! unhappy maid! this awful night Bereaves thy wandering mind of reason's light! Is this Evanthe? she so meekly given In calm devotion to her sire and Heaven? Whose bosom seem'd so pure, that none might dare To deem one thought forbidden harbour'd there! 540 Now in her words can guilty passion speak, Glow in her eye, and redden on her cheek? Where is the downcast look, the pensive air, The Cross Evanthe ever wont to wear? Hold fast, lost Princess! hold that sacred sign, It cures all sorrows, let it solace thine," "Ha! am I mock'd!" the beauteous semblance cries, While each fair feature swells to giant size, While blood-red arms the phantom limbs invest, And the red helm displays a sanguine crest: 550 i( Yet tremble, thou hast spurn'd Evanthe's charms, But what shall save thee from infernal arms?" " What but that higher Power that Christians trust, A Saviour's blood, a God for ever just." ν 4
He hurls tho fiend to earth; the bands unlace, The falling helm betrays a female face, Though not Evanthe's —but the blood forsook The Monarch's cheek, and every fibre shook.— He knew those charms in opening youth that stole With such seducing witchery on his soul; 560 He dared for them with hostile France conspire, For them in rebel arms assail'd his sire; On holy Pandulph rais'd his impious spear, Till Heaven in thunder check'd his mad career. 1 From hence what length of wars, what weight of woes, What long remorse,—but oh! what glory rose! For bence in penance to th' Elect of Heaven, With humble heart he sued to be forgiven, And robed in sackcloth to their scourges bow'd.* Hence, to atone the guilty deed, he vow'd 570 His banneron the Sacred Plains should shine, His arm affront the conquering Saladine.
Hence, where Calabria's mountain-hermit dwelt, On each rude rock in pilgrim garb he knelt, And wondering heard, what heaven-descended sights On Judah's hills had blest his wakeful nights, How from th' Apocalypse his gifted view The past expounded and the future knew; Where prescient Heaven, in mystic phrases seal'd Its pardon of the Monarch's crime reveal'd; 580 And bade, when Syria saw his flag unmrl'd, His name outshine the conquerors of the world. v Hence, when the vital spark should quit his breast, Had Richard will'd, that though his heart might rest In that dear city which he ioved the best, (Delighted when her Minster's fretted height, Grew like a child beneath the parent's sight,) His corse, where Everard's holy springs distil, Placet! at his father's feet, should ask forgiveness still. 1 * Such painful thoughts officious memory rais'd, 590 As bending o'er the prostrate form, he gazed, On charms unseen since he believed them pure, And vow'd his love should with his life endure: While feelings that had slept for years, again Burst in full force upon his aching brain,
" Demon!" he cried, " how well thou know'st the art, To torture though thou can'st not shake my heart. 'Tis but a semblance, yet Alasia's form Arrests my vengeance and unnerves my arm. Hence, in His name this blessed sign who bore, 600 Delude my sense, and vex these groves no more." " Fond man! thou robb'st me of an instant's power, I scent th' advancing dawn, and know my hour. But mark this crest, this armour; mark them yet— The face methink'st thou can'st not well forget; Thy heart in vain the vision may despise, The dread reality shall blast thine eyes." As from her narrow cell Aurelia springs, And spreads to summer suns her ample wings, Thus from the bursting mail Moozallil rose, 610 The trembling wood its mighty master knows. So vast his stature, that the proudest oaks Reached not one ringlet of his raven locks. On his dark brow a thousand furies sate, Revenge, and pride, and e ver- during hate; He shuns th' approaching sun, but leaves the sod All black and blasted, where his steps had trod.
What sacred spell is in the morning light, That with the darkness melts the fears of night? Fatigue and pain, and sounds and sights accurst G20 Are vanish'd, like the dreadful dreams they nurst; Up springs each warrior, springs with joyous bound, And calls with cheerful voice his comrades round; At his own fears amazed, and the control Of night and darkness on his alter'd soul. Yet, though with that pervading radiance came Health to the mind, and vigour to the frame, Fresh care succeeds; those stores that prudence pil'd, Are drench'd by rain, by birds obscene defiled. In vain they seek, if haply there may twine 630 The juicy melon, or th' uncultur'd vine; For every fruit in those dark brakes that grew, Scared by its nauseous taste and livid hue. Rank lurid herbs that wizard hands distil, With potent juice to aid their powers of ill; Some whose foul scents their innate guilt declare, Or thorny fruits bid careless hands beware; And some more dangerous far, of fragrant breath, Whose taste is poison, or whose touch is death. Beneath those shades (whose wondering echoes rung With discord harsh) were holy matins sung,
When Richard bade to hasten on their way, Nor lose one hour of vigour in delay. ' r Ere night our swords shall all we need obtain. Or force a passage to the friendly main." Now Berengaria came, and on her arm Evanthe, bright in every youthful charm. Well had Moozallil mock'd her eye of blue, Her lips, her cheeks, like roses wash'd in dew; But could not mock that purity of soul, 650 Which breathed a holier beauty through the whole. In every act, each modest glance exprest, In every folding of her spotless vest. Oh! if those powers accurst, that only live In prompting man to ill, could ever give Those charms one moment's sway in Richard's heart, 'Twas when in thought he scorn'd their baffled art. The march began, but wearisome and slow,—· Above the woods impede, the bogs below: Blythe were the warriors, when the orb of day, 660 Thro' boughs less dense could send a brighter ray; And when the tainted gale betray'd no more, The damp unwholesome marsh it linger'd o'er. But short their joy, the lessening umbrage shews On Arsouf's heights arrayed the wary foes
Thick as the blades of grass in vernal hour, Or locusts that those tender blades devour; Gay as the fields when bright with summer dews, Or beds of tulips, deck'd in rainbow hues. (What time to cheat the Haram's weary hours, 670 Voluptuous lamps illume the gaudy flowers.) ad " Ah!" thought the King, c ' how oft my eager sight Has sought this foe, and long'd to close in fight! But now with bands dishearten'd, spent, opprest^— Yet spare these murmurs, Heaven decrees the best. Let our stout yeomen close in firmest rank To form our van, and guard each íengthen'd flank, While all the knights the white-veil'd car surround, Nor trust their steeds amid the broken ground. Albert, Ricardo, long beloved and tried, 680 \ To you with fifty warriors we confide, > In yonder wood, our sister and our bride.— j * St, George for England Ï' be the signal given, Till then restrain your rage, and trust in heaven." Oh, courage! though thy bold, unshrinking hand From flaming pyres could pluck the lighted brand, An army's chief implores a higher power To nerve his mind in battle's awful hour.
The cool quick sight that marks each peril nigh, Nor madly braves, nor basely turns to fly; 690 The soul that now its valour can repress, Now seize the point when daring gives success. All these were his, who with one piercing glance Each present evil saw, each future chance; How well their post the adverse army chose, Where on one side th' Enchanted Forest rose, On one fierce Arsouf s foaming torrent flows, While pent in narrow broken ground, unknown, Or known to fear, what perils wait his own; Who marks each danger, marks it but to foil, 700 And, nobly conscious, glories in'his toil. And these are his whom Europe late beheld, When vaunting Gaul, by'British might compell'd, Left her lost eagles on the fatal field! Nor scorn, illustrious Chief! my humble praise— Not yet the hour is come when bttrds shall raise Thine far above an elder Arthur's famej When age shall teach, and infants lisp thy name. I speak not öf a bloody despot, hurl'd From ill-got émpire-^or a rescued world— 710 But (dreadful tíríly in 'his distant roar) That present War deform'd not Albion's shore;
That still our altars and our throne endure, Our fields are fruitful and our hearths secure; That every peaceful home unaltered shews Those nameless comforts England only knows. All these, our grateful tears confess it true, All these to thee, to thee and Heaven are due!,END OF BOOK VII,

CŒUR DE LION.,BOOK VIH.,THE BATTLE OF ARSOUF* On Arsoufs hill the Moslem myriads shone, Their yellow standards glittering in the sun. 'Mid shouts of " Allah!" and the martial call Of shrill Nacaire, and Zel, and Atabal,* The Soldan views his ranks,—a barded steed On either side attendant Mamlukes lead;,χ 2
There plumes and banners sink and rise again Like foam on billows of the chafing main; While, motionless as rocks that guard its flow, \ And silent as th' untrodden mountain's brow, 10 > The Christian army frowns in shade below. 7 The sable hauberks clothe the fields in night, \ Save when some biazon'd pennon beams to sight, > Or glares the thirsty steel's portentous light. J The wolves, that hail the thunder-cloud of Avar, Look from their dens; the vultures speed from far. Now showers of javelins hurtle through the sky, Like wintry snows the plumy arrows fly; a The Moslems bleed; their happier foes endure The baffled storm, in stronger mail secure, 20 Their hearts with valour arm'd, their limbs with steel, Unmoved as sculptured forms that cannot feel, They stand,—till Richard mark'd the Moslems pour From their exhausted sheaves a scantier shower; The signal sounds,—at once the lances beam, The banners wave, and, like a mountain stream, Led by D'Avesnes, burst forth his eager knight3, Drive back the foe, and win the nearer heights. But Mosul's lord, and Mosul's braver heir, Arbelia's pride, and Sandjar' s Prince were there, 30
Omar and Afdhal, like the morning star, The Soldan's eldest hope, and new to war. They meet the chief, who, all to fury given, Shouts loud his war-cry, " 'Tis the will of Heaven!"* Twice he rush'd on, and twice repulsed, again Spurs his stout charger o'er the heaps of slain. But Adel from a distant height survey'd His brother's wavering bands, and hastes to aid. The arrows bristled in each jewell'd fold Of the rich turban round his helmet roll'd, 40 White waved his triple plume, but white no more, 4 Soon was its silver down bedew'd with gore, \ And each bright fringe his chesnut courser wore, j Where'er he came gay shields in shivers flew, Crests, arms, and mangled limbs the plain bestrew, And steeds ran masterless,—deep groans were mixt With clash of arms, and shouts that rose betwixt. Pierced by his spear was sage Bertulpho slain, Albrando next, both vassals of Louvain; And Antwerp's lord; till, tired of meaner foes, 50 Furious he seeks with great D'Avesnes to close.,x 3
The Flemish lance on Adel's buckler broke, But Adel's scymitar, with mightier stroke Lopp'd one stout leg; nor present death can tame The martyr's soul, such death as leads to fame; His frighted steed pranced wildly o'er the plain, Yet still he grasp'd the unrelaxing rein, Collecting all his strength, to right to left His sword descends, and helm and corslet cleft; Though all the ground was redden'd as he past, 60 Though now each stroke was feebler than the last, He yields not yet, till Adel comes again, And hand and sword fall sever'd to the plain. He sinks in blood, but with his dying breath He calls on Richarb to avenge his death. íc í come, brave Count!" th' impetuous Monarch cried, And plunged his golden spurs in Favel's side: Nor waits his troops; —determined squadrons nigh Oppose his arm, they feel it and they fly, Adel he seeks, but Add distant far, /0 On Otho's bands now waged destructive war: His Egypt bleeds the while; tõ one proud heart Drove Richard's spear, then drawing back the dart, He through his comrade thrust with mightier force, And pinn'd him dying to his dying horse,
Whose spine received the point; the lance he leaves, And to the brain his sword Benama? cleaves. Now Reduan came:—where Thebes of old to war Pour'd through an hundred gates the rattling car His fathers dwelt; he bears no waving crest, 80 Nor brass nor steel his mighty limbs invest · Once (when deserted by the ebbing Nile) He found and slew the slumbering crocodile; Sheathed in its spoils thenceforth he scorns the shield, And either practised hand the sword can wield. But Caliburn, 'gainst which no fence avails, Shivers iike glass the adamantine scales; He falls, he stains the verdant skin with red, "4 His comrade flies, but shooting as he fled, V To Richard's ear th' unerring arrow sped. 90* Slight was the wound, such wound as but inspires The hero's soul, and rouses all his fires. He snatch'd an archer's bow,—the Egyptian steed In vain was swift, more swift the winged reed; Beneath his shoulder was the barb addrest, The barb empurpled issued at his breast. Now numbers perish'd, nor the muse may tell Their names, or how by various deaths they fell, Or bravely, or by wounds dishonest gored, Yet few were found to wait th' Armorie sword. 100
Omar alone, to none whose valour yields, Omar, the hero of an hundred fields, Waves high the yellow badge of Ayoub's blood, While his round shield in proud defiance shew'd A Moslem trampling on the Holy Rood. The King beheld; with fiercer fury stung, He seized the axe that by his saddle hung; The breaking helm was heard, the crashing bone, And Omar from his seat a shapeless mass was thrown. Nought now restrains Plantagenet, —his blows In hideous ruin crush the shrinking foes; While like some winged courser Favel flew, To Arsouf s stream he drives the trembling crew; Alike they fall beneath his axe, or brave The foaming tide, and perish in the wave. Now to the cliffs they rush, nor heed below The rocks, the seas, so much they fear their foe. Again in blood they dye that guilty shore, Of old so deeply stain'd with virgin gore, Till he, the saint that Albion's sons implore, 120 Freed from the dragon's jaws the royal maid, And at her feet the slaughtered monster laid.*
Unconquer'd Richard basks in victory's smile; Defeat frowns darkly on his rear the while. Before the flower of Asian warriors ride The brother Sultans, more by love allied. But though the practised eye on either face Might read the kindred lines of Ayoub's race, Well might it marvel at the tie which binds In wondrous union such discordant minds. 130 One pale and spare, in sable robes arrayed, No jewels deck'd, save on his Syrian blade; No gaudy hues, save where the plumes that grace His casque, attest his empire and his race; But Adel, named the Thunderbolt of Fight, In stature lofty, as supreme in might, With diamonds flamed, and gloried to behold His meanest followers clad in gems and gold. Generous to friends, he could forgive his foes, And yet his slaves would shun the path he chose; 140 With all an Arab's scorn of blood he slew, And mercy was a fault he never knew. While learned Imaums shared with Saladine An hermit's meal, he quaff'd forbidden wine; A nation's wealth his new seraglios hide, While Saladine, with more of patriot pride,
Bade thousands toil Kahira's walls to frame, b Or delve the well ennobled in his name. Fate brought ambition, his reluctant guest, Native she sprung in Adel's haughty breast; 150 Alas! when Azrael shall their love divide, Young Afdhal's realms may rue his uncle's pride. Now first on earth was Norman Arnulph laid, * A noble victim, worthy Adel's blade; The Soldan's spear the Danish Silric found, Pierced through the eye, the brain received the wound. The brave Anglure, incensed, to vengeance flew. But check'd the blow, the yellow crest he knew. Nor less the Soldan mark'd the noble knight, Of old his prisoner in Tabaria's fight, 160 And for his prowess tax'd at ransom high, 111 might his scanty lands the mulct supply. Him, at his earnest prayer, the Soldan freed, Amid his friends to seek the glittering meed; One year to Gaul's proud lords he sued in vain, Nor longer could his bride the knight detain. For honour call'd him to resume his chain. Such virtue touch'd the Soldan's generous breast, With gifts he graced him, and with freedom blest;
Now pleas'd that grateful thoughts his falchion staid \ He dropp'd his own; "no! thou hast shared my bread, 4 " Seek other foes, if thou must fall," he said. \ Alas! his doom was near, for Adel's hand, Relentless Adel 1 stretch'd him on the sand; But in Poitou, the eldest of his line, For ever bears the name of Saladine. 0 Earl Ferrars next at Adel aims the blow; Pleased that its weight announced a worthy foe, The King accepts the fight, and wheeling round, E'en as he turns, his side receives a wound j 180 He rais'd his sabre, but the Earl with care Eludes the steel, which spent its force in air; Again the Norman struck, but struck in vain, The shield's tough plates the fierce assault sustain; The Earl's left shoulder feels th' avenging stroke, Through arms, and flesh, and crashing bones it broke; His powerful hand resign'd the ponderous shield, His noble blood rain'd crimson on the field. Yet still he grasp'd the sword—one effort more— Again his eyes exult in Adel's gore; 190 He falls, yet blest that not in vain he dies, Waits the stern stroke that sends him to the skies.
With grief and fear his shuddering troop was fill'd, But rage in Percy's noble bosom thrill'd. Furious, to meet th' Egyptian king he rode, And couch'd his lance; but soon the brittle wood Snapp'd in its rest, the Moslem aim'd his sword, Full at the temper'd casque of Whitby's lord; He leap'd aside, the steel with erring force Miss'd the good Knight, but slew his generous horse. Yet soon on foot recover'd, Alan stands, And, rashly brave, th' unequal fight demands; His blows more swift than autumn's clattering hail, On Adel's buckler shower, and Syrian mail. The Monarch, maddening that a single knight So long detain'd him, summons all his might; Beneath the helm a dreadful stroke he sped, And from his shoulders parts the gasping head. Alas! already had his princely line Twice dewed with blood the sands of Palestine. 210 Again shall Percy's orphans mourn, again With solemn dirges seek St. Hilda's fane. d Now, by the Soldan pierc'd, Vigano lies,* Cleft to the brain, the noble Stourton dies;
When Suabia's hapless Duke, who, vainly brave, With grief and sickness wasting to the grave, Scorn'd on his couch to yield a sluggard's breath, In glorious battle seeks a nobler death. Attired once more in long neglected arms, The feeble frame his ardent spirit warms; 220 As when by him Iconium's Prince was slain/ His eyes flash fire, he seems himself again. His reeking sword is drunk with Moslem blood, But when against Damascus' lord he stood, His transient vigour fail'd; in short career Borne down, transfixed by that unerring spear. His Teuton knights to Arsouf's forest bore Their lifeless leader, weltering in his gore, And in the son, again the sire deplore. Nor sleeps the war, where Sion's sovereign stands, The Red Cross champions, and Provençal bands; There near young Aladin Seiffeddin fights, Dark Mestoc there with Sandjar's Prince unites, And one whose limbs in Christian armour drest, Bore on the ruddy helm a sanguine crest; A naked sword the ruby shield display'd, And "Vengeance" glow'd around the threat'ning blade.
Alas! Alasia, does that martial gleam Thy royal race, thy gentle sex beseem? Far hence that sickly softness, skill'd to hide 249 Its selfishness in sentimental pride; That not for others but itself afraid, Weeps, faints, bewailing where it ought to aid. But woman's courage needs no plates of steel, Its gentler office not to wound, but heal; To bear resign'd, to hide the starting tear, To speak the hope her bosom cannot share; O'er pain's cold brow a heavenly beam to shed, And watch, unfearing, by contagion's bed; These are its triumphs, which though Fame deny 250 An earthly crown, she writes in gold on high. Yet thee I blame not, beauteous Almahide, Noureddin's daughter, and Aleppo's pride: But not in luxury train'd; that Prince forbore \ In Haram bowers to waste the peasant's store> > Nor gems, nor purple his Sultana wore. j An Arab she, she taught her child to bear The stubborn bow, and chase the dappled deer, Where Pharphar cools Damascus' violet vale, And breathes from neighbouring hil Is th' inspiring gale/
But when her sire resign'd the flame of life And from his ashes rose the bird of strife, When Judah's Lord (than him less generous far Who on a kingless state had scorn'd to war), Assail'd his sorrowing realm, the royal maid In martial weeds her lovely limbs array'd, With dauntless breast opposed his bloody track, And from Belinas turn'd Amalric back. Then to the Soldan, who from Egypt flown, Made Syria's princely bride by force his own,* To him, w r ho in her father's favour bred Now spoii'd the royal house he once obeyed, She knelt, and from his generous pity won The vow to spare Noureddin's infant son; But when (by long and fierce assault subdued) For Mosul and its rebel Prince she sued, Unwilling to forego a realm so fair, So hardly won, he scorn'd the Virgin's prayer; Yet after long with vain remorse would chide Th' obdurate heart that woman's tears denied. Thenceforth amid a peaceful realm she reign'd, And war she never sought, but well sustain'd/
Till roused by Richard's fame new ardour warms Her regal soul, again she shines in arras; Nor Richard's self might scorn the martial pride, And powerful spear of noble Almahide. While Raymond hastes to check Seiffeddin's rage,, While Bertrand and Arbelia's Prince engage, While Lusignan and fierce Zorayda fight, While Geoffrey braves Moheddin's equal might, 290 Her javelin's force the wondering Templars know, Or feel the vigour of her sounding bow j By valour as by vows forbid to yield,* 1 With noble blood they dye the verdant field. On every side she slays, her smoking steel Provence and Flanders, Brabant, Syria feel j Till all the van, in dire confusion tost, Flies to the hills and mourns its bravest lost. But Aladin pursues his glorious course With all the lightning's swiftness, all its force; 300 Where frowns the central might of England's war, His daring arm assails the sacred car. Some sunk, the victims of his Syrian steel, Some crush'd inglorious, by his courser's heel; Behind their Prince the youth of Persia came, Rapid as whirlwinds, terrible as flame;
With shouts they charge—but, resolute to die Or guard their Standard, England's chivalry, By Asia's brother Kings already prest, To the new fight their dauntless fronts addrest. 310 Tliere Múlton, Tancarville, and Pembroke stood, And Osmere, sprung of old Elphegius* blood;* His golden sheaf there gallant Grosvenor rears, There the white cross of Perceval appears;f There Leicester first his father's banner spread;' There shines De Karreo, who so nobly bled, Adorn'd with recent honours; Dutton's lord, Proud of great Odard's far-descended sword; And Pelham's youthful pride—no braver name Decks the long annals of his line of fame; 320 Not even that Knight to whom on Poitiers' field Gaul's vanquish'd King his captive sword shall yield. k But Osmere soon the Persian javelin slew, And Pembroke's steed without a rider flew; Reft of a limb, his squires afflicted bear To calmer scenes the proud Fitz-Herbert's heir.,VOL. i.,γ
T'was then that D'Oyîey,— he whom none excell'd In mortal conflict or the listed field, Who once unknown his Sovereign's spear engaged, 1 — With Aladin a doubtful combat waged; 330 Nor ever yet that ardent Prince had found A knight more skill'd to give, or ward, the wound. Now here, now there, on either batter'd mail They strike infuriate, and by turns prevail; Till fortune, to the Saracen inclined, Instructs his powerful arm the pass to find, Where the dark hauberk, forged with little art, Admits his sabre to the Christian's heart. But Perceval, long bound by grateful ties To D'Oyley's house, enraged to vengeance flies. ra 340 In vain,—his better arm the Persian cleaves, And pale on earth the wounded Norman leaves; And but his squire was near, on Arsouf s plain The son of Ascelin had swell'd the slain. And now the conquering Prince his rowels hides In Safie' s flank,—the affrighted crowd divides; Alike he spurns the living and the slain, And dares with impious touch the car prophane.
Bold Harcourt hastesto save; and Stanley's knight, Talbot and Compton, dragons of the fight; 350 While Turneham and heroic Pelham spread The groaning sand with heaps of Persian dead: This soon the Prince observ'd,—his horn he wound (His studded horn that gave a silver sound); First at his call the youthful Osman rush'd, O'er friends and foes impetuous Ghazi push'd; Afdhal, Zorayda, Zenghi, Almahide, Forego the spoil, and to his succour ride; But (for what speed can match a father's fears?) Seiffeddin first with foaming steed appears. 360 Now man to man and horse to horse opposed, In one small space is all the war enclosed. Here armour rings, and broken weapons fly, Blood dyes the earth, and dust obscures the sky! Now Hamo fell, the prey of Almahide;* Khorassan's Prince by powerful Leicester died. By Roland pierced, rose Alp's expiring yell, By Afdhal's hand the conquering Roland fell. The young Fitzaubert, who on Arsoufs plain Nurs'd the fond hope of gilded spurs in vain, 370,v 2
By Almahide to lasting slumber sent, His faithful sqtiire shall Leicester long lament. Loud rings the clash of arms;—the press of war Nearer and nearer thickens round the car: Its purpled wheels are choked with mounds of slain, And its white veils receive a crimson stain. The Christians yield I the Prince with powerful spear Strikes from his seat the hardy charioteer; While Solyman, of all the Mamluke train Bravest and first, usurps the vacant rein." 380 'Twas then, while Múlton with impetuous force On Mosul's hope impell'd his powerful horse, That Grosvenor (from his hand the falchion thrown) Springs on the wheels, and drags the Moslem down, While his strong knee his struggling foe comprest, His dagger's point th' unwilling soul dismist. Orasmin, long his partner of the war, Seeks from the field his dying friend to bear; In vain,—his arms and gilded helm inspire Fierce Bertrand's grasping soul with strong desire; O'er his slain foe his mighty shield he spread, And by his side he lays Orasmin dead. Alike in Ayoub's yellow livery drest The field Bedreddin and Miralis prest.
On Kaled next the bold De Karreo flies, And, cleft by Harcourťs axe, Shirazin dies. But Bertrand, like some massy tower, defied Abdallah's strength and overweening pride; Three half-armed Franks upon his lance had bled, " Breathes there a fourth dares meet its force? " he said: The Viscount, striking ere he deem'd him near, Lopp'd with his trenchant blade the lifted spear; Then as his arm his sabre's hilt explored, Deep in his side he drove the fatal sword. But now from Arsouf's forest moving on, The knights of France and warriors of St. John, With shrill-voiced clarions pierce the troubled air, Fall on the Moslems, and reverse the war; And, long victorious on the neighbouring height, To seek fresh foes descends the Emerald Knight. 410 Graceful as Mars he reins his matchless steed, A milk white jennet of Iberian breed. Meantime th' Egyptian King the fight survey'd— His arm in dust twice twenty knights had laid, Whose dauntless fronts the snowy Cross display'd. Ţ Now resting from the field, he sees advance The fresh attack—he grasp'd his powerful lance, y 3
And sought the Soldan —who from war retired, As Moslem rites at glowing noon required, First on his hands the cleansing water pour'd, 420 Then, bent to earth, the God of Heaven adored. His beauteous dwarfs around the Monarch stand, Λ And chaunt harmonious, as their laws command, > That holiest Koran, traced by Omar's hand; j While all the rush of war, the mingled cry Of rout or conquest, swept unheeded by. c In admiration lost, th' Egyptian stood, Nor on his brother's silence dared intrude Till Saladine arose. Then, " Lo! he cried, i( Where from yon wood Gaul's red-cross warrio ibride, And with proud Austria's azure legions come, Our ancient foes, the Champions of the Tomb." "Charge, Adel! charge! we give them to the sword, In Alla's name,—be Alla's name adored!" And calm as when the quiet sod he prest, The dauntless Soldan fix'd the lance in rest; To check th' advancing squadrons, ere they gain The level ground, and join the English train. Half lost in herbage, where a torreni crost The narrow path, he plant*· his little host; 440
Soon its blue waves run purple to the main, And the rose-laurel wears a deeper stain. First, pierc'd by Adel's Land, De Coucy fell, Whose hapless tale Provençal bards shall tell; For ere his soul its earthly prison broke, With faltering accents to his squire he spoke: " To Fayel's bride convey this bleeding heart, Whose hapless passion scarce with life shall part; Perchance, though to its living woes severe, She then may grace it with a pitying tear;— 450 Fame, and her love, and Paradise, to gain, I wear the Cross, nor let me wear in vain."— Alas! the squire, while he his route explored, Met in a wood the lady's jealous lord; And, all unconscious, to his ear disclosed Within the urn what precious heart reposed. He hears, and credits half the tide: the rest In frightful hues his jaundiced fancy drest; His phrenzy deepens, nor believes the dame, Loved by such knight, could scorn his faithful flame. With savoury spice the wretched heart he drest, And saw his bride enjoy the dreadful feast! Then told the whole;—when she who prized his truth, Even while her virtue shunn'd the hapless youth, γ 4
Would with no meaner food pollute his tomb, And pining, met the voluntary doom/ Yet did not his fond heart forget to beat, Nor Coucy's soul desert its earthly seat; Till Ermengard, neglectful of the fight, Of all his sins had shrieved the pious knight. 470 Meanwhile the battle bleeds. On Adel's spear Died noble Clermont, and the brave San cerre. The Count of Dreux, beside his own arrays His brother's troop, the vassals of Beauvais; Vaunting he came—but when his eye beheld The scene of death, by sudden terror quell'd, He turn'd his steed; and through his squadrons spread Their leader's fears, till all in tumult fled. Not so St. Paul's brave Earl; beneath him slain, Three noble steeds are stiffening on the plain, 480 Fearless he mounts a fourth; his dreadful brand With hideous ruin sweeps the Mamluke band; The Knights of Sion, fired with rage, imbue Their scarlet mantles in a deeper hue. Here Ermengard for deathless fame contends, Here storms Fougères, and Mestoc there defends. But, like some tiger springing from his lair, In battie dreadful as devout in prayer,
The Soldan seems—on horse and foot alike, His blows descend, and kill where'er they strike. 490 First of the noble fell Tilli ères, and then Castillan's Baron, and the bold Turenne; Gournay and Ponthieu; q and a warrior drest In sable arms, his helm without a crest; A cedar, once the patriarch of the glade, Crush'd by the bolts of Heaven, his shield display'd, " How fall'n, and whence!" the mournful legend said. Alas, he perish'd! Not a squire unlaced His casque, or friend the words of peace addrest; None knew that in that humble guise was quell'd 500 A chief that once Edessa's sceptre held, Whose house should give (from Moslem conquerors won) A race of sovereigns to Byzantium's throne/ But when unhorsed the Lord of Newburg fell, Lamenting thousands raised the piercing yell; That heart which ne'er to asking want denied, That hand which Europe's famish'd host supplied, When, whelm'd with countless ills, on Acre's plain They look'd to Tyre's relentless Prince in vain,* Is cold! But angel harpings hail on high 510 The " faithful servant " to eternal joy.
Brave as that Lysoi, from whose triumph came His lineal pride, and Montmorency's name; Graceful in youth, the noble Joscelin flies To proof of arms, and Saladine defies. One in the flower of youth, when just began The supple joints to knit and fix in matı; And one in vigorous age, ere slow decay Unnerved those joints and stole his strength away. Meanwhile where Hubert heap'd thefield with dead, " Turn, Sarum! turn!" a voice of thunder said; " Turn, hateful recreant to thy vows profest! How ill those stains beseem thy priestly vest. Has earth or hell an union more abhorr'd? Peace on thy lips, and carnage on thy sword!" He turn'd,—his foe was red with Christian gore, His shield the Prophet's moony ensign bore; Th' unvizor'd helm Rodolpho's face betray'd, A Templar once, but now a renegade.* " Thou, ti'aitor! say whom most his God shall prize, The man whose sword defends him, or defies?" The priest return'd; by righteous anger sway'd, Deep in Rodolpho's throat he drove the blade;
While the warmlife-blood chokes hisstrugglingbreath, His fate he curses, and blasphemes in death. But near the Prelate's side Guiscardo stood, And spoke aloud, by sudden fear subdued: " St. George! thou guardian of our English host, Now lend thy aid, or Christendom is lost.'* Sage Hubert smiled: " Heaven loves not those that fear, 540 A firmer faith had made thy sight more clear. О thou, the strength of England's line, dispense A brighter beam to his benighted sense." He pray'd, and Guiscard sees a stranger knight, Steed, arms, and vesture, ail of silver light; But on his casque he bore a dragon crest, A sanguine cross his diamond shield imprest; His lance was gold, and as the lightning glides Through hardest rocks, the Moslem mail divides; Blood spouts around, yet not one drop might dare To stain his radiant arms or glittering spear; While each true martyr, ere he yield his breath, Looks to that stranger's eye, and smiles in death. Now shouts are heard! from Arsouf s crimson stream Willi thundering speed triumphant Richauj? came.
He, not too far by present glory led To scorn the havoc far behind him made; Changed like a god the fortune of the war, And the foil'd Moslems quit the half-won car. Oh, Cœur db Lion! why withhold the name 560 With which applauding comrades stamp'd thy fame; When armies fled before thy withering glance, And victory waited on a single lance? Äs earth, and rocks, and bristling wood betray Where the spring torrent forced its furious way, Though Alpine snows supply its rage no more, And the hot sun have wasted all its store; Of arms and steeds, the wounded and the slain, A ghastly track grows dreadful o'er the plain. Such then the terrors of his arm, that still 570 At Richaed's name Arabian bosoms thrill! The restive courser starts that sound to hear, And infant cries are check'd by sudden fear. u Where yet by Arsouf's wood the Moslems fought, Dismay and death his biting falchion brought. What checks his conquering course?—a form, a face, Whose youthful beauty oft he loved to trace, Defaced with many a gaping wound, and known By Montmorency's eaglet-crest alone.
" Ah! whence this cruel deed?"—The dying lord 580 Waves the red remnant of his broken sword, And points to Saladine, who on the right Still urged the fainting Lombards into flight. The Monarch spurs to vengeance. "Turn!" he cried, (C By England's King is Saladine defied. Ah î what avails this throng of martyrs slain? While we, the authors of the war, remain? Let angry strife suspend its mutual rage "4 While we for Sion and for fame engage— 4 Thy fabling Koran, and th' Eternal Page." 590^ (i I never brought a ruthless host from far To seek thy crown, and rouse thy world to war; Me not with curses ravaged Europe names, Her harvests trampled, and her towns in flames! The war is thine!—Yet come," the Soldan cried, 4 " Ne'er was it said that Saladine denied \ To meet a foe that Islam's faith defied." y They wheel around, they rush in full career, Each sits unmoved, and breaks his faithless spear. The Soldan snatch'd a second from his slave, 600 To Richard's hand a second Pardo gave; Again th' impetuous chiefs the course renew, Again on earth the shining splinters flew;
Till either Sovereign, casting from his hand The shiver'd truncheon, bares his glittering brand. Now blows descend, above, below, around The lightning flashes and the arms resound; The Soldan's sword, at Richard's head add rest, Cleft from his morion half its broomy crest; While Caliburn through helm and turban glides, 610 And from the Soldan's arm the mail divides. The Soldan strikes again,—his furious blow- Rings on the buckler of his mighty foe,— It lops the golden boss j but Richard lent A dreadful stroke, which, on his shoulder sent, Forced him to earth, while, from his burthen freed, Pranced through th' affrighted rank» the startledsteed. Now Richard springs to ground, to wage the war On equal terms; but Mosul's generous heir, Who mark'd his Sovereign's need, dismounts in haste, And on his seat the wounded Soldan placed. In vain would Richard now the fight prolong, Around their Chief the faithful Mamlukes throng; With England's King a desperate strife maintain, And in the press was beauteous Favel slain/ Just as the Monarch with an active bound, Leaped to the seat, he felt the erring wound;
Deep in his side received the stroke of death, Bent on his knees, and gasp'd his latest breath. Oh î then what wrath in Richard's bosom rose, 630 A wrath that issued not in words but blows. What wrath inflamed his Peers! on all the plain With fiercer fires the combat wakes again. On foot the Monarch fights,—the dastard crowd Flies from his single arm; he shouts aloud, i( Bring forth my generous Lyard 1"—at the sound The Norman war-horse paws the echoing ground. Black were his limbs as Pluto's murky reign, And glittering bells adorn his glossy mane; His furniture was gold;—with wings outspread, 640 A dreadful raven nodded o'er his head. Long had he mourn'd to see the Cyprian steed Usurp his master's love j—from bondage freed, And prancing to his lord, he joys again In his proud load, and spurns the purple plain, He champs his golden bit, his eyes flash fire, Beneath his hoofs the trampled crowds expire; The living fly, they see their comrades bleed, Nor deem that wond'rous horse of mortal breed. While Caliburn now these, now those, bereft 650 Of life and limb, or to the saddle cleft.
Such fear ensues, that had not Adel's hand Enforced the valour which his words command, And been himself their shield, that fatal day Had swept the boast of Ayoub's race away. But with surpassing rage the Leopard Knight Pursues the Moslem who disturb'd the fight; Seiffeddin's offspring, by his father's care Already mounted, and engaged in war. They met, and each the half sheath'd falchion drew, Λ And rais*d, and dropp'd; for each together knew, > One the veil'd shield, and one th' egret of blue, j ťí Nay," Pardo cried, ťí our force let others feel, Nor hands once clasp'd in friendship urge the steel; Farewell!"— (i Yet pause," said Aladin, " and hear If to thy heart Almanzor's child be dear: Thou know'st that long (though wars» might intervene) Moheddin sought her for his haram's queen. Prepared already was her ample dower, And presents given, and fix'd th' auspicious hour,670 When droop'd the nymph—in vain the Imaums pray'd, Or bound with holy scrolls her burning head; Pale as the unconscious tenant of the tomb, Or blossom withering in the hot simoom,
Her spark of life seems twinkling to expire; So Rezia weeping said—her wretched sire Explores a cause in vain, but none can tell, Unless thy conscious heart resolve the spell." He paus'd; but Pardo vainly sought reply, Till feeling burst in one convulsive sigh. 680 " Ah! what avails it—Oh! could both forget, Thus doom'd to meet no more, that e'er they met! What now remains but to bewail thy doom, And pine like thee, and perish on thy tomb!" if Hope yet sb^ll live!" cried Aladin: " attend— Foe to thy faith, believe me yet thy friend: Though sacred laws perchance, or jealous pride, Have here to love his sweetest food denied, Soft looks, and ' whispered thought of hearts allied:' Yet he who swims the moat, and scales the wall, 690 Gains strength from bars like these, to leap them all. He teaches language to the silent flowers; And not a blossom decks Arabian bowers, How scentless, small soe'er, or faint of dye, But bears some sense to conscious beauty's eye. Such will í twine—I know their legends well— The passion-flower a Christian Knight shall tell; vol. i. z
And hope, and fear, and mutual love exprest, Amina's fluttering heart may read the rest. But see, while thus the precious hour I waste, 700 What demon sweeps our ranks!"—he waved in haste His graceful hand, and spurred his foaming horse, While death and terror mark his conquering course. But Pardo sits entranced:—the flying throng, That Richahd scatters, pass'd uncheck'd along, Till Mahmoud spoke: " Is this a place of sleep? " Christian 1 thy slumber shall be long and deep; Deep as the grave."—But, waking from his trance At the rude summons of the Arab lance, Young Pardo spurs his steed; to earth he bore *J\ 0 The vanquished Saracen, to rise no more. Urged by that inward grief that knows not balm, And rage, which only Moslem blood can calm, The Knight, whose courteous manners all admired, Now seem'd some fiend, with wrath infernal fired. Grave Ibrahim, whose beard of snowy white Down to his girdle flow'd, a reverend sight, Seized by that snowy beard, contends in vain, His headless trunk falls bleeding on the plain. Reft of an arm the Nubian Calaf died, 720 The deadly weapon pierced Melcazar's side:—
Melcazar, sweetest of the youths that sung His own Bokhara's odorous shades among; Her shepherds oft by fount or citron grove Wept as he pictured hapless Mejnoun's love; Whilenymphs, like Leila fair, the bowers would throng, And with applauding roses crown the song; Or shower'd sweet jasmine from their latticed screen, Like fairy favours, dropp'd by hands unseen. Shahriar, who in Medina's house of gloom 730 Thrice saw his Prophet's self-suspended tomb, And strove the sins of early life to clear By fast and prayer, and penitence austere, Despite of texts inwoven with his mail, Falls, nor his Prophet nor his prayers avail. Thus (like Hyperion, when his orient ray Gives gracious promise of a golden day) While the young hero track'd his way with blood, Aghast in wonder hoary veterans stood; E'en Cœur ώβ Lion check'd his foaming horse, 740 Amazed, exulting in his favourite's force. A Christian Knight,—but let the page of fame Refuse its record to the dastard's name—,ζ 2
By Aladm's ungated sword pursued, Sought fatal refuge in th' Enchanted Wood; He sought and found—for through the waving leaves White vests and glittec'mg arms the Prince perceives; Nor longer for the craven's blood he burn'd .But from the grove his docile charger turn'd; An instant sees him at Zorayda's side. 750 " Bright moon of earth, ray soul's best gem," he cried, " Vain is our struggle here, our valour vain, 4 He who could yonder wolf of war restrain \ Might bid the wither'd leaves be green again. J * Yet if for vengeance pine my injur'd love, The Monarch's Haram waits in yonder grove, Slight seems the guard, not slight our triumph won If in his consort's fate we rule hib own." Strong in the wilüng aid of Almahide They quit the field, and through the forest ride; 760 And soon they came where, fearless of a snare, Far from the clash of arms, the shouts of war, Each royal beauty through the waving shade Seem'd nymph, or dryad of the shadowy glade; Anxious, yet calm, their thoughts to heaven addrest, With pious hopes they charm their fears to rest.
The reckless Hermesind, in smiles arraj'd, Lists to Ricardo, who beside her laid, Pours his delicious flattery on her ear, Or turns with looks of livelier joy;o hear 770 Her converse brilliant, sprightly, and refined, But like the dew, that leaves no trace behind. Unhappy youth, forbear the moonlight grove, Break thy soft lute, and cease thy songs of love; Nor hope, bewilder'd in her witching snare, To touch that heart, if yet a heart bc there. Drown Love in War:—and hark! that war is near, On his smooth shield rings Albert's warning spear; And fifty warriors, starting at the sound, In steely phalanx guard their treasure round. 780 His vizor down, his ashen spear in rest, 'Gainst Aladin the ready Albert prest; But he, who saw th' expected prize so nigh, Disdains the single fight, and past him by. Not so Noureddin's child; with lance opposed She meets her foe, and soon in combat closed; Both hope an easy spoil, and grieve to feel A warrior worthy of their practised steel. Meanwhile the Persian Prince and Gallic maid With baleful eyes the iron ring survey'd. 79J z í)
lil vain with taunts they rouse each faithful knight, Each curbs his rising wrath, and shuns the fight; While sure destruction threatens him who dares To rush, unhappy, on their hedge of spears. But the young warrior, tempering force with skill, Aims his light dart, to torture not to kill; Helias' steed receives the smarting wound ^ In his left eye, and flinging to the ground ν His startled lord, he spreads confusion round. J The line thus broke, prepared the Persian stood, 800 His vantage seized, and bathed his sword in blood.— The Pisan Ugo welters in his gore, Iberian Carlos sinks to rise no more; Carlos, who loved the proud Castilian maid, Whose heartless taunts his faithful vows repaid His life unblest, yet happy in his death, Since for her sake he yields his wretched breath. Her lover's dec is Zorayda's soul inspire, Her pride they kindle and her envy fire; She spares not those of Gaul's paternal soil, 810 Nor those once dear in Albion's happy isle. Where each devoted ivarrior seeks alone ч His sovereign's safety, and neglects his own, > Rich were her spoils, her laurels cheaply won. j
Of fifty, late the guardians of the shade, Cold on the turf are thirty heroes laid; While scarce the rest their ponderous arms sustain, And with a sanguine deluge bathe the plain. Count Mirlo piercing in her mad career, (Her cousin once, when France or kin were dear.)82J Now through the broken ring the fury flies, And hope already grasps th' expected prize; Evanthe, sickening, faints in mute despair, With clasped hands Matilda sinks in prayer; While Berengaria from a lifeless hand Snatch'd the broad shield, and waved the shiningbrand. " Death, not pollution for a hero's bride, For Richard's Queen 1" th' intrepid beauty cried. "■ For Richard's Queen!" her ruthless foe replied; {f And who art thou that därest such rank assume? 830 False bird, this hand shall strip thy borrow'd plume." But Albert sees, no more can Almahide Detain the Knight, he seek his Sovereign's side; What demon then might match Zorayda's rage, Again compell'd a desperate strife to wage? Robb'd of a prize that seemed already won, Her glory tarnished, and her vengeance gone. 7. 4
Nor less Aleppo s Princess blames the Knight, She calls him craven, and demands the fight; While anxious only from Zorayda's hand 840 To save his Queen, he slights her fierce demand. And she, too generous with unequal force To press a single warrior, turns her horse, And crossing, as she fled, Matilda's way, Bears through the forest her defenceless prey. Fair Hermesind's rich robes and courtly mien To Mosul's erring Prince exprest a Queen j Fawnlike she fled, she seeks the thicker wood, While on his goaded horse the Prince pursued. In vain Ricardo, desperate, crost his way, 850 To buy with life one instant of delay; And seized with powerful grasp the rein of gold, His wounded arm reluctant yields its hold; Yet scarce he feels the smart, one pang possest His faithful soul, and silenced all the rest. It chanced a path the flying virgin took Where dash'd o'er mossy stones a brawling brook; So close the rocks arose, and twining boughs,, That scarce its dizzy verge a pass allows. In need less desperate, ill the timid maid 860 Had dared that narrow dangerous way to tread;
At least had claim'd Ricardo's help, and shewn A thousand pretty fears, half feign'd and half her own. Yet fearless now she skims the slippery shore, Nor sees the foam, nor hears the waters roar. Ricardo saw, and while the Persian steed His tedious way with painful labour freed, He, fleetest of the fleet, in wanton course Who oft outmatch'd the stag, or generous horse, Now in the tangled brake by love sustain'd 3 870 Through nearer ways the angry torrent gain'd. Where to the rock above a cedar clung Impending o'er the path; aloft he sprung-— The crashing fibres yield, the falling shade Divides the eager prince and flying maid. In vain 1 —his steed scarce pausing, dares the bound, And lights uninjur'd on the slippery ground; He gains each moment on her slackening flight, He grasps her mantle; while the wretched knight, Crush'd by the load, and struggling in the wave, 880 Hears her loud shrieks,—he hears and cannot save î Who in that deadliest регЦ rush'd between? The Knight Unknown, the Knight of armour green! He who by coy disdain and silent pride Had touch'd a heart to pleading love denied.
In combat late with Egypt's King engaged By Arsouf s stream, his dauntless valour waged The íengthen'd contest, till when Asia's lord With England stood, they sheath'd the mutual sword; Nor since reviving war with fiercer hate Her fires rekindled, had the warriors met. " 890 Now warn'd by Saiem's King, who love-inspired, Mark'd where the Moslem Chiefs from fight retired, With him be followed, and as Lusignan To aid the Queen, to raise Evan the ran, For Hermesind he rush'd to fiercest fight, For Hermesind,— who check'd her weary flight. They tought, till Adel spurring through the shade, " And think not thus to shun my sword," he said, " Turn, Christian! turn; and thou young Prince, resign The fight unjust, yon craven's spoils are mine." 900 " Behold me here prepared," the Knight replied, (i For both or either; be ye both defied! Yet better might thy taunts be aim'd at those Who quit the field to war on female foes." ťť On female foes!" indignant Adel críes, As round the wood he rolls his searching eyes; i( Now praised be Alia! praised the Prophet's name, No true believer shares this deed of shame.
Thou, through thy visor'd casque so rarely seen, Whate'er thou art, apostate, Nazarene, 910 And thou young Fatimite, far hence remove, v Too much ye trespass on my brother's love. And know ye not that, when a city falls, E'en the rude conqueror spares the haram walls? z Christian! in combat we shall meet again — Meanwhile accept for each fair victim slain, Whate'er the price, her double worth in gold, Or two, the fairest that my harams hold. Hundreds they boast that well might pay the debt, Whose veils to me were never lifted yet."— 920 ťí Moslem! not thus a woman's worth we prize," With all a Christian's auger, Albert cries. " Say, should thy walls some Cleopatra boast, More fair than her for whom a world was lost, Poor were that ransom for Matilda paid, Our Monarch's sister, now dishonour'd, dead." (i Thy foul reproach, ungenerous Christian, spare, Nor stain our glory with so base a fear," Cried Mosul's Prince - t —*' by flattering demons led, We sought in bonds to biud each royal maid, 930 That he who fills Damascus' Avails with gloom, Who makes our towns a waste, our lands a tomb.
Who loves the widow's and the orphan's cry, Might find one grief to cloud his victory; Nor farther had our sated rage pursued, Nor stain'd one sword in unoffending blood; Then fear not for your captive, none," he cried, " Dares doubt the spotless faith of Almahide." That dreadful name which oft had spread despair Through marshall'd ranks, now silenced every fear. ίζ Enough," the monarch said, distrust and shame Ply from her presence^—I forbear to blame. And you, brave Christians! let your valiant Lord Forego his fears, and trust an Arab's word. We fight as sovereigns, not as fiends, to gain Or guard our faith, our glory, and our reign. Revenge we love, yet boast our hearts have wou A generous spark from yon all-bounteous sun; And by that only God, whose ruling will Perchance for good designs this seeming ill, By highest heaven, where saints and angels dwell, By the dread bridge and endless flames of hell, To England's King an Arab's faith I plight To bring the Princess with the orient light." 950 He spoke, and from the scene of contest leads, Abash'd and sad young Aladin proceeds;
While Gaul's proud maid her rival lingering view'd, And curs'd the sword that fail'd to shed her blood. Oh í if our will such baleful power could give, No mortal eye might meet that glance and live. But Hermesind, whose vanity was still Her beacon-light, that led to good or ill -, Graceful before her brave preserver knelt, Pour'd all her thanks, and more than all she felt. 960 Oh! who could hear unmoved, of mortal mould, Such gratitude, so eloquently told In tones so sweet, from lips of hue so bright, Such glowing cheeks, and eyes of liquid light! Yet if slight waving of the warrior's crest, Or silken scarf, some rebel thoughts confest, His words were calm and few.—" T'was knighthood's care, Her boast, her oath, to guard and aid the fair, T'was duty and no more."— " Yet hear," she said, " Nor deem that guile inspires a simple maid, 970 Or curious folly, if I fain would know, To whom my life, or more than life, I owe? Whate'er the cause that makes thee court disguise, My lips shall guard the trust my heart will prize,
Safe as the wealth to caves of ocean given, Nor breathed, save in my orisons to heaven; Those orisons which call its saints to save, For deathless fame, the generous and the brave." In swifter beat the heaving scarf appear'd, The murmur of preluding speech was heard; 980 When, as by some mistrustful thought inspired, He bowed a mute refusal, and retired. Baffled again, her angry feelings rise, And lightnings flash indignant from her eyes, They glance upon Ricardo's pallid face, And all again is gentleness and grace. Devoted more, but less by fortune blest, Still the fall'n tree his wounded limbs opprest. Who knew like her each fascinating art, In dreams of heaven to lap the willing heart! 990 Her eyes shone bright in tears, her tender hand Was gentlest, first, to fix each needful band; Nor her warm thanks with less of nature came, Though often check'd, as if by virgin shame; Or fear to raise,—since love to hope is prone— Hopes that her calmer reason might disown. Drest by such hands could wounds forbear to close, Could heart so happy vainly court repose?
As on his couch a lingering moon he lay, Bright rainbow visions wiled its lapse away. 1090 His was a courteous soul, whose livelier powers Could gild the stream of pleasure's social hours; But 'twas a radiance cold and rarely given, Like gleams of sunshine on December's heaven. Sweet were his songs, and framed with tuneful art To soothe or soften, not to raise the heart; While love, which fires the proud to arduous deeds In his mild breast its native sadness feeds. Yet ne'er had pleasure spread such halcyon calm, Ne'er seem'd his hours so redolent of balm, 1010 As now, though oft to thrilling pangs a prey— (Unheeded pangs)—for still with every day She came, like some angelic guest, to bring To his exhausted thoughts another spring. Short was her stay, by modesty restrain'd, Yet like soft fragrance on his soul remain'd Some look, some motion, as she left the tent, Some word or tone, as o'er his couch she bent. He longs for strength, for her to fight, to die; He trembles lest his dream of bliss should fly. 1020,END OF BOOK VIU.

Mount Carmel is memorable in Sacred History as the spot on which Elijah confounded the priests of Baal, and also as the scene of his retirement. The cavern which the Prophet inhabited is still shewn. This mountain seems to have been indeed one of those " high places " selected for religious ceremonies in all ages, and to have witnessed them in all their variety. After the fire of Heaven had thus once destroyed idolatry, we have the authority of Suetonius, that a pagan divinity of the same name with the mountain was worshipped there. He had an altar, and sacrifices, but no temple or statue. Him the Romans transformed into the Carmelian Jove, to whom Vespasian offered a sacrifice, when he came into Syria to subdue the rebel Jews. The Convent of the Virgin next occupied the height; it was in its turn profaned by Mahommedan superstition, but was afterwards restored, and gave rise to the military order of' " Our Lady of Mount Carmel," instituted by Henry the Fourth of France. I believe this convent is still in existence. Carmel has shared the fate of the rest of Syria, where neglect and oppression have made a desert of regions that nature formed 2a2
a garden. Its summit is craggy, but even there a few wild vines and olive trees attest the fertility for which it was once so famous, and whence it derived its name, Carmel signifying in Hebrew, " the vine of God." The mountain forms eme of the most remarkable headland» on the coast of the Mediterranean. Note (b), page 9, line 77. Joy! for this night the Queen Sybilla dies. Sybilla was daughter to Amalric King of Jerusalem, by his first wife Agnes de Courtenay, only child to Joceline de Courtenay, third and last Count of Edessä. She was first married to William Longsword, son of William the Third, Marquis of Montferrat, and elder brother of Conrad of Montferrat. By him she had issue Baldwin the Fifth. Her first husband dying, Sibylla married Guy de Lusignan, whom she is said to have chosen for his personal beauty. At her father's death, her brother, Baldwin the Fourth, succeeded to the throne of Jerusalem: but he was a leper, and his talents, though considerable, were not equal to supply the inexperience of youth and the defects of nature. He soon fell a victim to his malady, and the unhappy realm of Jerusalem, already involved in dangers from which only the greatest prudence and courage could extricate it, devolved on the infant son of Sybilla and Montferrat- Raymond Count of Tripoli was chosen as his guardian and regent of the kingdom: but he insisted, as he was next male heir to the throne, that the custody of the young king should be shared by Joceline Count of Edessä. The character of Raymond might have been deemed above suspicion, but the event shewed that his fears were prudent, for in less than six months the little Baldwin died, and his mother succeeded him aa Queen, not without suspicion of having contributed to hi» death.
Note (с), page 11, line f 09. The Cyprian sceptre base Comnenus sways. At the period when the poem commences, Cyprus waa in the possession of the usurper Isaac Comnenus, the descendant of that Alexius who filled the throne of Constantinople during the first Crusade, and whose hollow friendship, perhaps, cost more lives to the noble leaders whom he had invited from Europe, than his enmity could have done. It is impossible to read the history of those times, without wondering at the duplicity of the Greeks and the forbearance of the Latins. The feeling that the Greeks were Christians, and that their vow was to combat the enemies of Christianity seems to have had extraordinary force upon bands of warriors strong enough to have crushed the faith less empire, and who when in Europe were not remarkable for their moderation. In the middle ages (notwithstanding the glorious exception of two Emperors of the Comnenian line) the name of Greek appears indeed to have been synonymous with every possible aggravation of meanness, treachery, cowardice, and cruelty. Vinsaufì in a furious tirade against the Greeks, observes, that the vices of their ancestors remained to them, but that their virtues had aH passed into Italy. The perfidy of Sinon, the craft of Ulysces, and the atrocity of Atreus, were still theirs by inheritance. Note (d), page 12, line 148. Have we not crush'd Imperial Couraďs host? These lines allude to the disastrous event of the second Crusade. The Emperor Conrad the Third of Germany and Louis the seventh of France pursued different roads through Asia Minor; and the valour of tlie Seljouk Turks of Iconium was not move fatal to the followers of Conrad, than the perfidy of the Greek guides, who injured their health by supplying 2 a 3
them with unwholesome provisions, and either led tliem into deserts, where myriads perished from famine, or betrayed them to their enemies. The Emperor, at last, with less than one tenth of his original numbers, succeeded in joining the army of Louis, which had also met with many disasters, but was in greater force, and had been amused by the Greeks with tales of the feigned succe&ses of Conrad. The battle of Laodicea followed, in which the Turks suffered a defeat so signal, that the Greeks acknowledged the moderation of the Crusaders in not having levelled Constantinople with the ground. But many miseries again awaited them on their road to Antioch f and the second Crusade terminated in the fruitless attempt on Damascus. The town was already in the extremity of despair, when the Syriac Christians became jealous that their western allies should enjoy the spoils which their valour was about to win, and by treacherously prevailing on them to change their point of attack, rendered the whole expedition abortive. Note (e), page 12, line 153. Wefill'd with leprosy the courts of kings! The successes of Saladine had been assisted by an earthquake, which overthrew the fortifications of several cities that would otherwise have opposed him. These lines allude also to the comets and meteoric phenomena so often noticed in the history of the Crusades, to the frequer^ famine and drought from which the Christians suffered, and to the leprosy of Baldwin the Fourth. Note (f), page 13, line 170. Who trifles with his friendship, sports with fate. The conduct of Frederic Barbarossa, in resenting the duplicity of the Greeks was more spirited than that of hib precursors had been. In one instance he shewed his resentment by causing the standard of the western Empire to float írom
the walls of Constantinople, and Isaac Angelus found it thenceforward prudent to treat with somewhat better faith, a monarch that he found had the will as well as the power to punish him. The Sultans of Iconium followed the double policy of the Greeks, by feigning a friendship for the army whose approach they dreaded, and then profiting by its fancied security. But Frederic, though attacked in the mountains, and at disadvantage, when the two divisions of his army were at a distance from each other, gave the Turks a signal defeat. The Emperor and his son, Frederic Duke of Suabia, both distinguished themselves highly in this engagement. Note (g), page 19, line 293. " To rule the Eagle!" cried the Prince of Tyre. The house of Montferrat was descended from the Dukes of Saxony, and was at this period one of the most powerful in Italy. William the Third, surnamed the Old, had married a sister of the Emperor Conrad. He haà four sons: Boniface, who received the crown of Thessaly as the reward of his achievements at the taking of Constantinople in 1S03; William Longmord, the second son, has been already named as the first husband of Sybilla. Reynier, the third, died in the Holy Land about three years before the loss of Jerusalem. The fourth son, who after his imperial uncle bore the name of Conrad, was the most distinguished; and the graces of his person were no less remarkable than his valour. After the surrender of the Holy City, he arrived at Tyre in the very moment when the inhabitants Avere about to deliver up the town to Saladine. His presence inspired fresh courage, he forced the Soldan to raise the siege, and thus preserved the only city which the Christians still retained in Palestine. His assumption of the government and title of Prince of Tyre was a natural sequel to these events, but it is to be regretted % a 4
that his subsequent violence destroyed tbe esteem which he had acquired by his talents. Note (h), page 20, line 304. Or when /ier warlike peers no more obeyed. Scarcely had Baldwin the Fifth expired, when his mother became desirous to reign in his stead, and disdained neither stratagem nor false promises to satisfy her ambition and that of Lusignan. While the Count of Tripoli assembled the Barons of the empire at Napolose, the daughter of Amalric, acting by the advice of Heraclius, Patriarch of Jerusalem, and Eudon, Grand Master of the Templars, announced her intention of separating herself from her husband, and choosing a warrior who was able to defend the kingdom: on condition that tlie Barons would acknowledge as king, him whom she should elect. The Barons, who expected that her choice would fall upon Raymond, readily consented. The gates of Jerusalem were closed, and Sybilla repaired to the church of the Holy Sepulchre, attended by her nobles, and crowned with a garland. Mass was sung before tbe sacred tomb. Heraclius vowed fidelity to her in the name of the clergy and the people, pronounced aloud her divorce from Lusignan, and commanded her in the name of Heaven to bestow her hand and the sceptre on the man whom she believed to be most worthy. Sybilla next prostrated herself, to implore the guidance of Providence in her choice; then rising, she raised the chaplet from her head, and placed it on with solemnity on the brows of Lusignan, declaring that " man could not separate those whom Heaven had united." The nobles felt that they were duped *. and if a few, imposed upon by the splendour of the scene, applauded the conjugal fidelity and affection of Sybilla, the majority foresaw the evils which so imprudent a choice was likely to bring upon Jerusalem; and the friends of Raymond, in particular, felt indignant at the elevation of one, who while he
filled the high office of Regent during part of the reign of Baldwin the Fourth, had proved how unequal he was to the government of a kingdom, already involved in difficulty and danger.— Hoveden, Michaud, Mills, &c.

The Prince of the Assassins, stimulated, as is supposed, by the wish to be freed from a tribute which he paid to the Grand Master of the Templars, sent offers of alliance to Baldwin the Fourth, and a proposal to embrace Christianity with all his followers. To these advantageous terms Baldwin had agreed, but the Grand Master was loth to give up his tribute, and as the Envoy left the King's tent, two of the Templars (some say Eudon himself) fell upon him, and dispatched him with their daggers. Note (1), page 23, line 392. The bonds of life, this pains my sires in heaven. In this part of my story I have followed the judgment of Messrs. Michaud, and Marin, who endeavour to repair the injustice which appears to have been done to the character of Raymond by the greater number of historians. His discontent at the election of Lusignan to the throne of Jerusalem, led him to form a party in favour of Thoron, but Thoron declined the proffered honour, and Raymond retired to his county of Tripoli. Lusignan, instead of conciliating him, determined to besiege his town of Tiberias, or Tabaria; Raymond prepared to defend it, and in his anger implored
the assistance of Saladine. At this time dreadful portents were seen in heaven and earth, and the Knights Templars and Hospitallers were nearly all cut off by a Alusulman army, which had advanced into Galilee, on its way, it was said, to the assistance of Raymond. The terror of this defeat appeased the discords of the Christians, and Lusignan and Raymond were reconciled. The forces of the kingdom as· sembled in the plain of Saphoury, to the number of fifty thousand, when intelligence was received that Saladine had taken and burned the town of Tiberias, and now besieged İn it» citadel the wife and three sons of Raymond, who in- treated his instant succour. The Barons assembled in the tent of Lusignan, -when Raymond demanded to b ' heard: " I am about to offer," he said, " a counsel that will surprise all; but I give it with more confidence as it is contrary to my interest." In a word, he declared that he could not prefer the defence of his own family and possessions to the safety of the Christians of the East; the army now assembled at Saphoury was their only hope, and that to lead it into a dry and barren desert would be its destruction. He swore before God and men that he would voluntarily abandon the county of Tripoli, and all his possessions to save the town of Jesus Christ. Their only [interest was to destroy Saladine, and to preserve defenders to Jerusalem; and that all the evil« which might fall upon him would become a source of good, since he endured them for the cause of his Saviour, and the welfare of his people. The more generous this advice appeared, the less was it believed sincere. The Grand Master of the Templars blinded by his hatred to Raymond, interrupted him many times with allusions to his treaty with Saladine, and said that the hair of the wolf might be seen under the sheep's skin. When Raymond invoked the name of Christ, Eudon replied that Mahommed would sound better from a traitor. Raymond scorned to recriminate, but offered to submit to death if events were
not as he had predicted. Marin compares the blindness of the Christians to that of the Trojans concerning the prophecies of Cassandra. They persisted in accusing Uav- mond of treason. Yet the force of his reasoning prevailed, and it was determined to remain at ¡Saphour)'. But during the night tlie Grand Master of the Templars came to Lusignan, and filled him with the blackest suspicions of the treachery of Raymond. The weak Prince gave orders for the army to advance: for the first time he was obeyed, and it was for the ruin of the Christians. This army was indeed the only hope of Palestine, for even this was equipped from sources not ber own. England had already begun to supply tlie necessities of other nations; it was supported by the treasures which Henry the Second had sent to Jerusalem; and to associate that monarch in the glory of the expedition, the arms of England were emblazoned on the banners of the Christian forces. All was lost at Tiberias: the wood of the True Cross was taken, the army was annihilated, and Lusignan a captive. If the heroic valour of Raymond on this dreadful day, if the fulfilment of his words, be not evidence of Ids truth, it might be inferred from the wildness and incongruity of his calumniators. Raymond found refuge at Tyre, and on his return to defend Tripoli, was attacked by a mortal illness, caused by grief at the downfal of the Christians, and the shame of having been suspected of treason by those for whom he had sacrificed every thing. His ardent character changed to a deep melancholy, which ended in madness. The time of his death is variously stated. I shall say nothing of the idle stories, that he and Saladine had drank human blood as a pledge of friendship, that he fought masked against the Templars, that he had embraced Islamism, that he was smothered in hie bed by his people, who wished to force him to surrender, or that he was stabbed by the envoys of Saladine. Mr. Mills, 1 perceive, is among those who doubt the fidelity of Raymond,
fiut in my opinion the very violence of his character place» it above suspicion. Note (m), page 25, line 427, Bui Ыш1еа Hubert's mariiul pilgrimage. Hubert, Kiiihop of Salisbury, and afterwards Primate of England, deserves to be eíngled out even from a crowd of heroes; he was one of the bravest warriors of the third crusade, and not more distinguished for his martial prowes» than his Christian virtues. This prelate and the amiable Hugh, Bishop of Lincoln, form a striking contrast with the haughty Philip, Hishop of Beauvais, and the libertine Geoffrey, Archbishop of York (son of Kosamond), who became the helmet much better than tbe mitre.

As the crusades were supposed to be undertaken under the immediate sanction of Heaven, those who embarked in them expected some evident interposition of divine favour in their behalf. They disdained the common precautions of war, and murmured when they felt those evils to which their own imprudence had exposed them. In those cases, the clergy and leaders who shared the enthusiasm of their followers, or who were at least interested to support it, found their best resource in the assertion, that the crimes of the Crusaders (which were in truth sufficiently glaring) had forfeited the favour of the Almighty, and that it was in vain to hope for success, until a general reformation of manners and morals, accompanied with sincere penitence and humi- jiation, should first have washed away the stain. The appeal was seldom vain, reformation followed, and the enthusiasm which accompanied it frequently prepared the way to the anticipated success; and though the good resolutions which had been formed, quickly vanished in the delirium
eoo« .. -\ of victory, the licentiousness which ensued only gave fresh force to the next admonition. Antioch witnessed two or three of these alternations of feeling. While that city was besieged by the Christians, a severe famine led to the most horrible crimes: b'it the exhortations of the pious Adhemar were at length answered by a return to the strictest rules of moral discipline. Immediately afterwards Godfrey recovered from a violent illness, and a victory vas obtained over the forces which were hastening to the assistance of Baghasian. It would have been heresy to doubt that these happy events were marks of the restored favour of Heaven. Again, when the Christians, having conquered Antioch, were in their turn besieged by Kerboga, and reduced to extremity by a famine still more dreadful than the former, the " pious fraud" of the Sacred Lance was the harbinger at once of the restoration of order, and the signal victory which annihilated the army of that prince. Mr. Mills has drawn a very pleasing picture of the good conduct of the Christian army ¿before Nice. " The camp presented the rare and edifying spectacle of a chaste and sober soldiery; and although not free from the common disposition of exalting past ages at the expense of the present, the confession was drawn from the severest censors, tliat there was far more virtue among the crusading warriors, than among the hosts of Israel in old time. The simplicity and purity of the early church were revived. So affectionate was the union between the brotherhood, that all things were held in common. The generals not only commanded and fought, but watched, and did the most humble duties of the camp í so that the officer and the soldier were scarcely to be distinguished. Artificial discipline was needless, when virtue pervaded every part of manners,"— History of the Crusades, vol. 1, eh. İv.

The Crusaders probably owed the idea to the Pisans and Genoese, who sustained a considerable share in the siege of Acre. Vinsauf evidently speaks of it as α novelty. The fashion appears to have lasted only about one hundred and twenty years, being found cumbrous and inconvenient. It must have been almost impossible for a defeated army to save its standard.

Who Ы Tabaria's field its guards subdued. Tekieddin Omar was the nephew of Saladine, and one of the bravest of his generals. He was the bitter enemy of the
Christians, who had but too many reasons to deplore his valour. At the fatal battle of Tiberias he took Lusignan prisoner, and also the True Ctpse, which Rufìnus, the Bishop of Acre, according to custom, carried that day in battle. The Bishop was armed with a cuirass, contrary to the usage of all the other Prelates, who before htm had carried that Holy Wood unarmed, yet had never received a wound, whereas he, notwithstanding his armour, was shot quite through the heart with an arrow. Omar, in presenting the cross to Saladino, observed, " it should seem, from the lamentations of the Franks, that this wood is not the least important fruit of our victory." After Sala- dine's entry into Jerusalem, the splendid gold Cross which the Christians had erected on the summit of the mosque built by the Caliph Omar, and which occupied the site of the Temple of Solomon, was cast down and dragged through the streets in the mud, to the Tower of David, amid the lamentations of the Christians."— Maimbourg t Marin, Sţc.

With this slender guard, five of his principal Mamlukes (for the number is specified) Saladtne passed many times through the enemy, and endeavoured to rally his flying troops. Speaking of the Mamlukes, Marin observes, " we must not confound those whom we have hitherto called Mamlukes, with those that afterwards reigned in Egypt. This name properly signifies a domestic slave, and was given to those who were particularly attached to the service of the Prince or his Emir». In the commencement the Mamlukes were the children of the concubines of the Sultan, but afterwards the latter purchased slaves, of which they formed their halca or guard; and they often passed from the vilest employments to the command of armies. Saladtne was the first who formed them into a body of soldiers,
biibjected them to severe discipline, and employed them on the most important occanions. It should be remarked that these Mamlukes woie a sort of yellow hvery, yellow being a colour wiuch distinguished all his household and u.m h к as affected by thoíäe who wished to appear attached to it.

It has always been the custom for the principal Arabian or Moorish families to distinguish themselves and their followers by appropriate colours; of which many amusing exemplifications may be found in the History of the Quarrels of the Abencerrages and the Zegriea, in the " Civil Wars of Granada." Yellow was thf peculiar badge of the house of Ayoub, the father of Sala- dine t and the Soldan, no less proud to display his orthodoxy than hia personal power, always took care to blend the black and yeil&vo in his standards. Omar, as the nephew of Saladme, bore a yellow plume, and a yellow banner. In his wars with the Christians, the Koran was always carried in state in the army of Saladine; a proof that he, no less than the Crusaders, considered himself engaged in a religious contest.

The heaven descended Oriflamme ш/ьи.. The Oriflamme, or sacred banner of France, was reported to have descended from heaven, in honour either of Clóvis or Charlemagne, It was, according to Mailly, a simare banner of flame-coloured taffeta, without figures or embroidery, but
with three deep indentures at the bottom; and suspended to a gilded lance. Hence was derived its compound name, the word fiamme relating to the colour of the silk, and being also a name commonly given to banners of that form. Other writers have said that it was embossed with the golden lilies of France; but they have possibly confounded it with the royal standard, of which notice will be taken in a subsequent note. Mr. Southey, in his Joan of Arc, states that the Oriflamme was originally used only in wars against the infidels, and that in after years it became a signal that no quarter was to be given; he adds that when Philip (as reported by some historians) erected the Oriflamme at Crecy, Edward in return raised up his burning Dragon as the English signal for massacre.—The Oriflamme was in fact only the standard of the abbey of St. Denis, and borne in its wars by the Counts of Vexin, as Avoués or secular champions of the abbey, till Philip the First united the Vexin to the Crown, when this banner being in high reputation, he gave it place before even his own standard; the taste of the age enveloped its history in fable, and it was believed to ensure victory. The fallacy was at length proved, and the Kings of France found it expedient to forget it, or to feign that it had been reclaimed by Heaven under Charles the Seventh. Philip Augustus, previous to his embarkation for the Crusade, received the Oriflamme, and the bourdon, or pilgrim's staff, with great solemnity in the church of St. Denis. Note (x), page 48, line 908. And the glad seas feel lighten' d of their weight. In ages when the ocean has become the veadiest means of communication between distant regions, it is hardly possible for us to conceive adequately the terrors of such an expedition as the voyage from France or England to Jerusalem in the twelfth century, and it is probable, that nothing short of the almost incredible waste of human life which had been oc- 2 в 2
casioned by the land journics of the pilgrims, would have prompted the hazardous enterprize. In the time of Magnus the third of Norway, Skopte Augmundson, allied to the Royal Family, had warm discussions with the king about the succession of an estate, and not obtaining his demands, left the court. In 1100 he equipped five vessels for the East, and took with him his three sons: but they all died before they reached Palestine. He was however the first Scandinavian who had passed the straits. The ardour of crusading was kindled. Sigurd, one of the sons of Magnus, embarked from Norway with sixty vessels; was well received on his way by Henry the first of England; took the fort of Cintra in Lusitânia from the Saracens, beat them next at Lisbon and Alcazar; twice fought their piratical fleet, passed the straits, and in the Isle Formentera attacked the cave of some infidel pirates. It was overhung by a rock, which the Norwegians mounted, and crushed them with stones; then lighted wood before its mouth, and almost stifled the brigands, who made a desperate sally, but in vain; they were all destroyed. Sigurd gained a great booty, and received the solemn thanks of Yvica and Formentera for their deliverance. He was afterwards kindly received by Roger the Second of Sicily, and in 1110 landed at Ascalon, whence he made the pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and assisted at the siege of Sidon, The voyage had occupied more than two years, and this expediton, which has been strangely neglected by historians, was considered as one of the most remarkable of those which occurred during the Crusades. But it was only the nations of the Baltic and Adriatic who possessed any share of maritime spirit or power. In the days of Charlemagne, France had something like a navy, but it declined under his feeble successors, and was annihilated after the usurpation of Hugues Capet. England was not better provided. The Saxons had lost all the naval pride of their ancestors, and the Normen, or Normans, whose Danish forefathers had been the scourge of Britain, after
their conquest of England, bounded their voyages to the passage of the channel. Genoa, Pisa, Venice, and the Saracens of Barcelona, engrossed the whole commerce of Europe, and Philip Augustus and Richard were alike compelled to hire from the Genoese the vessels which conveyed them to Palestine. Nor were these vessels the floating castles of modern England. Closely resembling the Libumian galleys of the Romans, they trusted more to oars than sails. The compass was not then in use, and every nautical art imperfect and ill understood. The relation which Hoveden and others have given of the voyage of Richard, proves how completely the pilots stuck to the shore, and how much they feared the element which they pretended to govern. Even in the thirteenth century it was rare for a British ship to be seen in the Mediterranean.— Cattcau Calleville, Révolutions de la Norvège. — Mailly, Sţc.,BOOK II. Note (a), page 54, line 30.

says, that these regulations were called the " Laws of Oleron," from an idle story that they were enacted by Richard I., while his fleet lay at anchor in that island on its voyage to the Holy Land. But it is unlikely that another nation should give an English Sovereign the credit of any improvement which it might itself have disputed, and I think it probable that the " Laws of Oleron" originated with Richard, though they may have been first collected and consolidated under St. Louis. The time of Richard was then too recent, for a forgery to have derived any advantage from the supposed antiquity. Note (e), page 61, line 186. They lanced their veins, and drank the mingled gore.

The author must here beg pardon of all who may be interested in the fame of William the Second of Sicily, for having, to suit her story, bestowed upon that monarch a less amiable character than history assigns to him; in short, for having arrayed him rather in bis grandfather's colours than his own; though the appellations of the Bad and the Good
are neither of them perfectly consistent with historical truth. At the death of William, Sicily became a scene of confusion. Constantia, daughter of Roger, the father of William, and married by the ambitious policy of Fredciic Barbarossa to his second son Henry, afterwards emperor, was the legitimate heiress. But Tancred, the bastard oiFspnng of William, with the aid of a strong party in the lisland, which could ill brook the idea of a foreign master, or a female reign, usurped the sovereignty, and threw Matilda the widow of William into prison. Richard arrived shortly after at Messina, wher Tancred found it prudent to set her at libeity, and to compromise the claims which Richard made upon him for her dower, and for the wealth which William had bequeathed to Henry the Second of England, by the payment of twenty thousand ounces of golà as a compensation for the dower, twenty thousand ounces for the legacies, and by agreeing to equip ten gallies and six palanders or horse transports, for the use of the Crusaders.— Hoveden, Mills, fyc.

Having described the ornaments, and mode of procession of the assistants, the monk of St. Alban 's goes on; i They then stripped him of all his clothes except hiß breeches and his shirt, which was unsewed between the bhoulders, for the convenience of anoiating; being thin-shod with sandale worked with gold, the Archbishop Baldwiu
anointed him King, upon the head, between the shoulders, and upon the right arm, with prayers appointed for this purpose. Having then laid a blessed linen cloth upon his head, he placed the bonnet thereon. Having then clad him with the royal robes, together with the tunic and dalmatic, the Archbishop gave him the sword to subdue the enemies of the Church, which being done, two Counts put on his spurs, and having then received his mantle, he was conjured by the Archbishop, on the part of God, not to accept of the royalty unless he intended to keep his oath. Then taking the crown from the altar, he delivered it to the Archbishop, who ¡"»laced it on the King's head; he at the same time received the sceptre into his right hand, and the royal wand into his left. In this account I shall only notice the following particulars, namely, that the royal robes consisted partly of ecclesiastical ornaments, namely, the tunic and dalmatic, which are the principal dresses of deacons and subdeacons; becondly, that the spurs, which are the emblems of knighthood, were fixed on, not by the Archbishop, but by secular Barons; and lastly, that the King first took bis crown into his own hands, and so delivered it to the Archbishop, to signify that he did not hold his temporal power of the Church. This circumstance was of the utmost importance, at a time when the Church had recently forbidden Bishops and Abbots to receive investiture from temporal princes, by the pastoral staff and ring, lest it should be inferred that temporal authority was held of the Crown."'

It was the custom at these state feasts to remain many hours at table, and the intervals between the several courses were beguiled by various " interludes," or theatrical representations, which took place on the very table round which
the guests were seated. The personages which figured in these interludes were generally allegorical, and contrived to flatter the principal guests. The machinery was probably very inferior to that now used in pantomime, and the astonishment of the historian has undoubtedly not taken from its effect, yet it often raises an idea of more ingenuity than we are apt to expect from so rude an age, A more particular account of one of these interludes will be given in the note to the Vow of the Peacock. In the History of the Civil Wars of Granada the strange devices which the knights exhibit on their entry to the tournament held by Abenamar, and the wonderful transformations which occur, are so much in the style of these interludes, as to leave little doubt that the latter must have been of oriental origin.— St. Palaye, &c.

They were early instructed in those accomplishments which accorded with the manners of the age; were taught to receive with politeness the knights who arrived at the castle; to disarm them, to give them fresh clothes, serve them at table, and even attend to their wounds. But perhaps it would be difficult to convey a better idea o.' these feudal customs than is to be found in many of the speeches of that mirror of chivalry, the valiant knight of La Mancha. It was usual for the inferior knights to send their daughters for education to the castles of their feudal lord; but any lady of distinguished rank, beauty, and merit was solicited even by those whose lands lay at a distance, to accord to their children the advantages which they would derive from her instruction and example__ Si.

In loflier numbers breathed Tyrtceanfire. Bertrand de Born was one of the most extraordinary characters of his day, and Millot, (Hist. Littéraire des Troubadours), vemarks on the manner in which he has been passed over, both by literary and political historians. He was Viscount of Hautefort, in Perigueux, and began his career by depriving his brother of his share of inheritance. The unhappy Constantine obtained tbe support of the Count of Perigord, and Talleyrand Lord of Montagnac (ancestor to that Talleyrand, who held so distinguished a place in tbe cabinet of Napoleon), while Richard of England., then only Count of Poitou, and the Viscount of Limoges, suspended their own quarrels to embrace the cause of tbe injured. On the other side, Bertrand was supported by the Viscounts of Ventadour, Segur, Gordou, Gévaudan, Tartas, and Turenne The Counts of Foix, Angoulême, and Armagnac; the Lords of Puiguillen, Clarensac, Gragnel and St. Astier, great Barons, of Perigord, and, to crown the whole, the Prince Henry, elder brother of Richard, was to take the command.
Many of these names are as uncouth as if they had been borrowed from the Tartars, and have little interest to an English ear, but their number shews the manner in which the fiery Bertrand always contrived to engage in his own quarrels all the princes who were within the reach of his friendship or his reproaches. As violent in love as in war, his impetuous passions exhaled themselves on every occasion in songs, which have more of the strength than the sweetness of poetry. By these he animated his soldiers, he encouraged his allies, he irritated his enemies, he sustained his own hopes; and, when the flame of war was extinguished, by these he had power to rekindle it. It would be useless to follow Bertrand through the story of" his life, or rather of his wars, but some farther particulars will be given in another part of the poem. Suffice it to say, that Richard, by negotiation, contrived to avoid an engagement with his brother, and that Bertrand, after many alternations of friendship and hatred, finished by becoming the implacable enemy of the Lion-hearted King.

During the residence of the English and French Monarchs at Messina, many affrays took place between the former and the natives; in one of these the English being victorious, Richard's standard was planted on the walls of the Town, in a spot which Philip considered as a part of his own quarters—Philip highly resented this insult, (the more that he was fond of displaying his feudal suzerainty) and insisted that the standard should be taken down; Richard obeyed and peace was restored. Vinesauf, however, says, that Richard would not remove his own standard but consented that the banner of the French King should be hoisted by its side.

They appeared only at the most splendid feasts, they were dressed with the richest spices, decorated with gold, and jewels, and boi ne to the table by the most distinguished ladies. To carve the peacock or tbe pheasant, was also one of the proud pnvileges of the biavest cavalier, and he to u bom it was offered, was obliged in courtesy to protest his own umvorthiness, and not to accept the office but upon " great persuasion." The vow of the peacock is, perhaps one of the most romantic features of chivalry. The lady bore the honoured bird, which was always adorned with its gayest plumage, to every knight m succession, beginning h ith him v, ho was first in valour and rank, and each knight «as expected to signalize his courage and hib love by some \ow, made " before the peacock and the ladies." When this ceremony was completed, the peacock was boi ne back to the table, and placed before the chosen knight, who drawing his» sword, began to carve it with gieat ceremony, and it was expected that he should so divide it, as to give a morsel to each guest, ho« ever great might be the number. To illustrate this subject, and that of the interludes already mentioned, I will abridge a part of the account given by M. de St. Palaye of the feast held at Lille, m 1453, at tbe com t of Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundv, on account of the crusade against the Turks, who had jubt reconquere « Constantinople: " At last the festal day arrived. If the magnificence of the Prince was admned in the number and abundance of the couises, it shone still more in the spectacles then known by the name of " Entiemets." Diveis decorations, machines, figure^ of men and uncommon animals, trees, mountains, mers, even a sea covered with ships, appealed m the hall. All these objects, inteun.xed vol. in. 2 c
with men, and birds and other living animals, were in motion in the hall or on the table, and represented a sort of allegorical ballet. It is difficult to suppose what must have been the size of this apartment, which contained a table so spacious, besides the multitude of guests and spectators. AH at once a giant appeared, armed like a Saracen of Grenada. He conducted an elephant, who bore a castle, in which was a distressed dame clothed in black like a nun. In vain she requested the giant to stop: he led her forward to the table of the Duke, and there the captive lady, who was intended to represent Religion, recited a long complaint of the evils which she suffered from the Saracens, and the tardiness of those who ought to deliver her. Toison D'Or, King at Arms of the Order of the Fleece, then advanced, preceded by a long file of pursuivants, with a living pheasant on his finger, adorned with a collar of gold and gems, and presented to the Duke two damsels, of which one was Violante, bis illegitimate daughter, and the other Isabeau of Neufchatel, daughter to the Lord of Montague; each lady being accompanied by a Knight of the Golden Fleece. Then the King at Arms offered the bird to the Duke, in the name of the ladies, who recommended themselves to the protection of their Sovereign, " to the end that the antient customs might be observed, according to which at feasts and other noble assemblies, a peacock or other noble bird wtcs presented to the prince» and lords, that they might make vows in behalf of the dames and damsels who besought their assistance." The Duke replied, ťť I vow first, to God my Creator, and to the most glorious Virgin, and after them to the pheasant and the ladies," to carry the war among the infidels, &c. &c. The signal was followed by all his court: each knight vowed to distinguish his courage against the Turks by some singular exploit; and imposed upon himself some arbitrary penance. Some would not sleep on a bed, others would not eat off a table-cloth, some would abstain from meat or wine on certain days, some would not wear a par-
ticular piece of' armour, or would wear it day and night; some clothed themselves in sackcloth; in fact, the admirable ridicule of Cervantes was but the echo of these vows, which we that live in soberer days are apt to believe only the inventions of romance writers. The vows finished Λνΐ^ι a new spectacle. A lady clothed in white, like a novice, and bearing her name of Grâce Dieu in golden letters on her shoulder, led in twelve damsels, who represented the Virtues, which were to accompany the Crusaders. Each bore her name also embroidered in gold, and recited a few verses. These twelve ladies were the knightly virtues of Faith, Charity, Justice, Reason, Prudence, Temperance, Fortitude, Truth, Generosity, Diligence, Hope, and Valour, Et toutes enfin commencèrent à danser en guise de mommeries, et à faire bonne chère pour remplir et rachever plus joyeusement la fête." One of the most singular of these fantastic scenes is the Vow of the Heron, which forms the subject of an ancient poem, printed also by St. Palaye. The Count D'Artois being banished from France, took refuge in London. One day his falcon caught a heron. The Count was at first indignant at so vile a capture, but afterwards gave orders to his " officiers de la bouche" to pluck and dress it. At night, when Edward the Third was at supper w îth h is nobles, his Queen and her damsels, he entered, attended by minstrels and two noble ladies, bearing the heron between two silver plates, and advancing with great state to Edivard, presented to him this most cow-ardly of birds (which ís said even to fear its own shadow), as the reward of his indifference for a crown which he allowed to remain in the hands of his rival. Stung with this taunt, tlie enraged King swore that the year should not pass before Philip should see him in France, bearing fire and sword, to avenge this affront, were the French army ten times greater than bk own. The Count D'Artois then went round to the nobles, and all hastened to bind themselves by some wild condition. The 2 с 2
gallant Sir Walter Manny, whose ancestor accompanied Richard to the third crusade, engaged to take a certain town defended by Godemar du Fay. The Earl of Salisbury declared, in honour of the lady of his heart (the daughter of the Count D'Erby), that he would not uncover his right eye during the war. It is impossible to read the vow made by Queen Philippa without shuddering, for she called heaven to witness that she would destroy herself and her unborn infant, if the period of its bii th should arrive before her husband had taken her across the seas, in acquittal of her oath. Edward was filled with horror at her words, and forbade the vows to be continued. The heron was cut up and eaten. Froissart mentions, that at the battle of Poitiers there were many young knights who had one eye covered with cloth, and that they had sworn to their ladies not to restore it to its use till they had signalized their prowess in France. But most of these conceits were the refinements of a later age of chivalry than that in which the poem is placed. Note (p), page 105, line 481. Next sate Ό' Ar selles, and high St. Valery' s heir.

He then disguised himself as a harper, and being practised in mirth and jesting, became well accepted at the court where she resided. Here becoming acquainted with her, he after a while took her to England, where he presented her to King Richard, who received her courteously, and bestowed her in marriage on William Long Espee, one of his father's sons by the Fair Rosamond, at the same time surrendering to William the Earldoms of Rosmar and Salisbury as her inhek-itance.

The Sir Robert Harcoui t mentioned in the poem was the son of Ivo, and inherited his father's English possessions, leaving those in Normandy as the portion of his brothers, but it was properly his descendant William, the same that took so distinguished a part in the siege of Da- nnetta m 1218, that acquired the surname of the Englishman.

The arms of this branch (now Earls of Derby) are, on a bend Azure, three stags heads Argent. Note(hh), page 110, line 579. His name renmvnd on earth, his " Hope in Heaven." The name oí Percy comes from a town in Lower Normandy, near to Villedieu, and not, as some have supposed, from the accident of piercing a King of Scotland's eye, at the siege of Alnwick Castle: for though that accident is said to have befallen Malcolm the Third (who was contemporary with William Rufus), the officer that sle*v him was named Hammond, and had no connexion with the Percy family, who did not possess lands in Northumberland till the time of Edward the Second. Its progenitor was Mainfred, a Danish chieftain, who made irruptions on France prior to the expedition o£ Rollo. Two of Ък descendants, William and Serlo, assisted
William of Normandy in his conquest of England. William was much beloved by the Monarch, and obtained large grants of land in Hampshire and Lincolnshire. He was also in habits of close friendship with Hugh Lupus, who bestowed on him the lordship of Whitby, where he restored or rather founded the abbey of St. Hilda. His brother Serio became the first Prior, and his nephew William, who was at Serlo's death chosen Abbot, was of such high renown for sanctity, as to be afterwards canonized. This first Lord William de Percy wis surnamed Alsgernons (aux Moustaches); he went with Duke Robert and other Normans to Palestine in 1096, and died at Mount Joy, so named by the pilgrims who usually had the first view of the holy city from that eminence. Here his followers inter^d his body, but brought over his heart, according to the practice of those ages, to be deposited in Whitby Abbey- His wife was Emma de Port, for the Conqueror having bestowed on him Semar, near Scarborough, and other lands, " he wedded her that was very heir to them, in discharging of his conscience." Emma outlived her husband, and was herself a benefactor to Whitby. Their son, Alan, called the great Alan, was also so beni- ficent to the Abbey, as to acquire the title of its second founder; but his warlike achievements are wrapped in oblivion. He had seven sons, and the eldest of these had four children, but they died early, and he and his brothers passed away and left no heir. Maud, the eldest daughter, bad married William de Plesset, Earl of Warwick: but he also died childless in Palestine, and the only hope of succession remained with the youngest daughter Agnes. She married Josceline de Lovain, son of Geoffrey Barbatus, Duke of Nether Lorrain, Count of Brabant and Lovain, and brother to Adelicia, second wife of Henry the First of England. He took the name of Percy, but was permitted to retain his hereditary device, Or, a lion rampant, azure, which with a change of colouronly 9
is still the arms of Brabant and Hainault. Josceline was of one of the noblest families in Europe, being descended from Charlemagne, and from the illustrious Duke Régnier, who was taken prisoner by Rollo the Dane. Henry de Percy was the true representative of this illustrious line at the time of Richard's Crusade; but to avoid confusion, from the endless repetition of the same familiar name, I have changed it to one frequent in the family annals. In 1234 his younger brother Richard had contrived to get possession both of lands and honours, and it was not till after a solemn trial before Henry the Third, that his nephew William (son of Henry de Percy) obtained justice. The motto alluded to in the text is, " Espérance en Dieu." Note (ii), page 110, line 593. His look appall'd, and death was in his blow. The elder Percevais seem to have been remarkable at once for talent and cruelty. They are sprung from Robert, younger son of Eudes, sovereign Duke of Brittany; but were thence transplanted into Normandy, and at the time of the Conqueror possessed the castle of Yvery, with great estates and power, and the hereditary office of chief butler. Some of the family came to England with William; but Roger de Yvery, faithfully adhering to Robert, his eldest son, against William Rufus, was by the latter dispossessed of many of his lands, and particularly the castle of Yvery in Oxfordshire, which was bestowed on Guy de St. Valery, and was thenceforward called St. Valeria. In the meantime the main stem of the family reigned at the castle of Yvery in Normandy, which was built by Albre- da, wife of Ralph, Earl of Yvery and Baieux, who had more of the lioness than the dove in her composition, for when the castle was finished, she ordered the architect's head to be struck off, that he might not build another like it; and afterwards, attempting to retain possession of it against her
own husband, was killed by him in the attempt. Their son Ascelin (sometimes called Gouel de Perceval) inherited all his mother's ferocity, and acquired the surname of Lupus from his violent character. He was a great warrior, and commanded the Norman forces at Mantes, where William the Conqueror received his death-wound. But one of the most remarkable features of Ascelin's life, was his war with the Earl of Bretevil, on account of a woman which his (Ascelin's) youngest brother had ravished. He defeated the Earl, took him prisoner, and confined him three months in the castle of Breherval, where he was treated with the utmost severity, and exposed at the upper windows of the fortress to the frost in the depth of winter, covered only by his shirt, which was previously dipped in water, and in this situation was he compelled to remain till it froze to his back. Nor could he escape ex ore Lupi, from the jaws of the wolf, till he agreed to give three thousand dreux pounds for his ransom: and, what must have been more galling than all the rest, to yield his only daughter in marriage to Ascelin. Nevertheless the war revived, till in three years the Earl was nearly ruined, but he found means to interest Philip King of France and Robert Duke of Normandy in his cause, and also the clergy, who were incensed against Asceline for the little reverence he had shewn them. In Lent, 1095, the Earl, with the forces which all these allies could raise, assisted by Robert de Belesme, a very expert officer, and an inveterate enemy to Ascelin, and by the engines which had lately been usedat the siege of Jerusalem (they having been invented about that time by a famous engineer in the first crusade), attacked Asceline, in Breherval; but he defended it two months against them all, and at last made a treaty, by which he remained in possession of all his honours, only allowing the Earl of Bretevil to retain quietly his castle of Yvery, the suzerainty of which Duke Robert had bestowed on him, and which was one cause of quarrel. Ascelin
not liking to pay to the Earl the homage he had formerly paid to the Duke. The second son of Ascelin, William, surnamed Lupellus, or the little wolf, rebelled against Henry the First. After an unsuccessful battle, he was taken prisoner by a peasant, but bribed him with his arms to let him escape. The peasant shaved him in the manner of an Esquire, and carrying a staff in his hand he reached the Seine, where he was forced to give his shoes to the boatman for his passage, and so go barefoot home. William took part with Matilda against Stephen. After his death the surname of Lupellus seems to have become general among his descendants.—Richard his fifth son continued the line, and being nearly related to Earl Strigulph whose mother was like his, a daughter of the Earl ofMellent, he accompanied him in his Irish expedition—and was with Richard in the Holy Land. | ought to apologize for the length of this note, but the history of this family seemed to me to present so good a view of the darker manners of the times, of the discourteous Barons against whom knight errantry was really useful, that I felt unwilling to curtail it. —Ascelin must certainly have been one of the greatest as well as one of the worst men of his time. Note (kk), page 115, line 688. And wondering wisdom warbled from his tongue. Pierre Vidal was one of those strange contrasts, so often met with in the history of the middle ages. The character of his muse was different, or he might perhaps bear a comparison with Alfieri, for while good sense and sound feeling reigned in his poetry, his life was marked by an eccentricity little short of madness. St. Palaye calls him the Don Quixote of Troubadours. The professed admirer of every beautiful woman, he believed himself equally the object of
regard, and often boasted of imaginary favours. Having once indulged his vanity at the expense of a Provençal lady, her husband punished him by slitting his tongue. Hugues, the Lord of Baux, took compassion on him, and had hira cured. He remained attached to the family, and soon became enamoured of Adelaide wife to Barrai de Baux, the head of the house. His whimsical passion was a source of great amusement to this lady and her husband; and the latter, far from being jealous of his extravagancies, gave him arms and habits like his own, and allowed him the freest access to his wife. Adelaide on her part pretended to return his love: but being soon disgusted with the presumption which her affected smiles inspired, she forced her husband to dismiss the unhappy minstrel, who while exhaling his sorrow in verses which are yet remarkable for their sweetness, sought consolation in war, and went with Cceur de Lion to Palestine. The bravadoes in which he announced his prowess were not less extravagant than the complaints in which fie breathed his love. " My enemies," said he, " tremble at my name, and the earth shakes beneath my steps. All that oppose me I cut to pieces." It may well be believed that such a character was a source of great amusement to the young Knights who accompanied our Lion-hearted Monarch, and they alternately amused themselves with feeding and exposing his follies. During the King's residence in Cyprus, they contrived to marry him to a lady, who appears to have been distantly related to some one of the families which had sate on the throne of Constantinople. They persuaded him that she was niece to the Emperor, and was to have the diadem transferred to her. No more was needful to heighten Vídal's eccentricity to madness. He usurped the Imperial state and title, gave that of Empress to his wife, had a throne carried before him, and expended all his earnings in support of his Utopian dignity. Nay, so incurable was this fancy, that five and twenty years after, he
succeeded in collecting a little troop as mad as himself, and made a crusade to Constantinople, in the hope of recovering his empire. But perhaps the most ridiculous proof of his wildness, was that elicited by his passion for Louve de Penautier, a lady of Carcassonne. As her name signified a female wolf, he thought himself bound not only to assume in her honour the name of Loup, but to wear the wolf-skin also, and in this disguise to be hunted by his own dogs, whom he would not permit to be called off till he was at the point of death. The lady's compassion prompted her to dress his wounds, but she laughed with her husband at his folly. This folly, however, scarcely ever touches his writings, and the moment that the muse possessed his fancy, she seems to have inspired him with a discrimination and prudence, which it would have been well if he could have carried into the affairs of life. His tale of the Jongleur not only gives admirable lessons to the young Troubadour for his conduct in the world, but some hints by which his patrons might be benefited. He also composed a treatise on the government of the tongue, an invective against Philip Augustus for not redeeming the Holy Sepulchre; another against the King of Spain, for buying peace from the Moors instead of subduing them. He complains of the conduct of the priesthood, and the encouragement given to heresy by their bad lives. And, finally, he launches into invective against the Emperor Henry the Sixth, for detaining Richard in prison, against the faith of nations and the privileges of Crusaders. In short, his themes were various, and generally handled with power. Note (11), page 119, line 792. This zeal in age is fed with Christian blood. One of the first exploits of Saladine was the overthrow of the Egyptian or Fatimite Caliph, who had his residence in Cairo, and was of course the determined enemy of the or-
thodox caliph, or Caliph of Bagdad. Saladine was through life remarkable for his strict adherence to die doctrines and observances of Islam; and though the Crusaders often forced his noble mind to respect individuals, his hatred of their religion seems to have been not less virulent than theirs for Mohammedanism. Note (mm), page 120, line 804. And Mosid's lord was vassal of his hand. Yemen, or Arabia Felix, was conquered for Saladine by his brother Touranschah, a man whose bloody and violent disposition formed a strong contrast to that of tlie Soldan. Saladine was long engaged in war with the Sultans of Mosul, whom after a violent contest he subdued. Note (nn), page 120, line 806. My fatal reign, my sorrow, and my shame. There is little temptation to enlarge on the melancholy picture presented by the last years of the kingdom of Jerusalem. Amalric was a brave soldier, and might have made his power respectable, but his avarice and inconsistency ruined his cause. The blind passion with which he sought to obtain the wealthy dominion of Egypt led him into long and useless wars, while at the same time he had the inconceivable folly to sell some of his strongest fortresses to the Saracens and the next moment to break the peace formed with them, if the slightest prospect of advantage was held out from another quarter. Hfs son Baldwin the fourth was only thirteen when Amalric died, and was afflicted with leprosy. Raymond of Tripoli became Regent during his minority, but his reign from the first hour of its commencement was disturbed by the dissensions of his nobles. As Baldwin grew up to manhood he took the reins of government into his own hands and signalized his brief authority by the complete defeat of Saladine near Ascalon. But his spirit and activity gave
way beneath a fresh attack of disease; an unworthy jealousy of the power and commanding character of Raymond led him to prefer Lusignan as Regent, and he soon after died, leaving the crown to Baldwin the Fifth, the infant son of Sybilla, and William of Montferrat. The events immediately subsequent have already been noticed in the First Book. Note (oo), page 121, line 832. And at my feet down dropp'd Chatillon s head. The humanity of Saladine, and the cruelty of Richard Cœur de Liosr, are phrases which must be familiar to many of my readers.—It is not my wish unduly to exalt the character of my hero, neither would I rob the Conqueror of Jerusalem of one well earned laurel. His conduct to the vanquished in the City deserves the highest praise, and is an instance of that generosity of which the history of the East offers so many striking examples, and which does not in those climes appear incompatible with acts of the greatest cruelty in the same individual. Rinaldo of Chatillon was the object of peculiar resentment to Saladine. Raised by the preference of Constantia, widow of Raymond of Poitiers, to the throne of Antioch, he was for many years the captive of Noureddin. When he regained his freedom, Bohemond, the son of Raymond, was old enough to govern his dominions, and Constantia was. no more. Rinaldo married the widow of Humfrey of Thoron (father to the Thoron who appears in the poem) and thus became Lord of the impregnable fortresses of Carac, and Krak or Montroyal. From this latter place he ravaged the frontiers of Arabia, and when peace was concluded with Saladine, still continued his incursions. Saladine remonstrated to the King of Jerusalem, but Baldwin the Fourth had not power to punish or restrain his vassal. Rinaldo who had often plundered the caravans of Mecca and Medina, now conceived tlie bold project of penetrating even to those cities, and of pillaging the Caaba and the vol. ι. 2 b
. Tomb of the Prophet. Assisted by a band of Templars, he surprised the Egyptian merchants, who were conveying along the Red Sea, the treasures of India, and entered triumphant into countries which had never yet beheld the Christians. He reached the valley of Rabid, about ten leagues from Medina, where he was attacked by a Syrian army and defeated, Rinaldo and a few others escaped as by miracle to Krak. Part of the prisoners were executed as criminalo, and we have the authority of the Arabian historians, Schaha- beddin, Tabari, and Aboul-Feda, for stating that the rest were immolated at the same time with the victims sacrificed at the ceremony of the Grand Beiram. This horrible execution did not satisfy the vengeance of Saladine, and he invaded Syria, incessantly repeating the vow to kill Chatillon with his own hand. It was not, however, till the battle of Tiberias, that this daring warrior fell into the hands of the Soldan, when the circumstances of his death are faithfully given in the poem. The day after the battle witnessed a scene which was still less in accordance with the humanity ascribed to Saladine. He caused such of the Knights of the Temple and of St. John, as were among the prisoners, to he led before him, and declaring, that he u would deliver the earth from those two abominable races," he permitted the emirs and doctors of the law, who surrounded him, to kill each a knight. Loaded with chains and incapable of resistance, these devoted warriors disputed with each other the honour of first receiving the crown of martyrdom, and many who had never belonged to the military orders, cried aloud, that they were Templars or Hospitallera, and gloried in partaking their fate. Saladine, seated on his throne, beheld and applauded the execution. Note (pp), page 121, line 836. Compell'd at length to own the Soldan's reign. After the battle of Tiberias, in which Lusignan was taken
prisoner, Jerusalem, under the oi deis of the veteran Balean D'Ibelin, made a more resolute defence than could have been expected from its destitute condition; but was at last forced to surrender. The Latin historians remarked that the Crusaders had entered the Holy City on a Friday, at the very hour whcn their Saviour submitted to death to atone the crimes of man. The Saracens rc-took the town also on a Friday, the Mahommedan day of religious observance, and, according to their belief, on the anniversary of the day when their prophet arose from Jerusalem on his miraculous journey to Heaven · but an eclipse of the sun, which took place at the moment the conditions of surrender were adjusting in the tent of Sal adine, was regarded as an evil omen. Note (qq), page 123, line 866. " And the twelfth moon" he w?V/, " shall f nd him f ree." Saladme was touched by the grief of Sybilla, and promi&ed that as soon as his power i\as established, he would restore her husband to liberty. He also felt for those who had lost their friends at Tiberias, and liberated such of their sons oi husbands as were among hib prisoners. Many of the Christians had abandoned all their wealth, to bear out on rheii shoulders their infirm friends or parents. Saladino rewarded their disinterestedness by liberal gifts, and permitted the Hospitallers to remain in Jerusalem to nurse the sick. Note (rr), page 125, line 908.

Egerton Brydges, in his notice of the family of St. John, in Collins's Peerage, says, " This Roger de St. John was with Richard the First at Acre, when that Monarch thought of this device. He tied a leathern thong, or garter, around the left leg of a certain number of his knights, to excite them to greater courage. This some think was the first occasion of the institution of the Order of the Garter." It suited me better to place the investiture at Cyprus than at Acre.,BOOK IV. Note (a), page 134, line 22.

The kindred Sultan of Roum, whose capital waa first at Nice, and afterwards at Iconium, rent many of its fairest provinces from the Greek empire, and maintained itself till 1308. It is from this branch of the Seljouc Turks that the Ottomans now upon the throne of Constantinople are descended. The Seljouc dynasties of Caramania, of Aleppo, and Damascus, were of shorter date. The last was that of Damascus, which city was given up to Noureddin by Ayoub, the father of Saladme, who was then Vizir to the last Seljouc prince, Modgireddin Abe. Ayoub had been under great obligations to Noureddin, and his brother,
Shiracoush, was then in his service. The Sultan rewarded them both with liberality, and Ayoub received the government of the yielded town 'as the meed of his treachery. These two emirs were also endowed with the peculiar privilege of sitting in the presence of Noureddin, without waiting for permission. Note (c), page 136, line 64. The placid Soldan fill'd his simple throne. Luxury has been the common reproach of the east: yet it may be remarked, that its greatest conquerors, at least in modern days, have been distinguished by the simplicity and even austerity of their manners. Such were Noureddin and Saladine, Ghenghis Khan, and his descendant Tamerlane. Note (d), page 136, line 71. And Äladin, whom youth's warm hopes inspire. From the many names which belong to these young princes, I have endeavoured to select those most capable of being moulded into English verse. The history of the Arabs (Universal History) relates, page 514, that Saladine, having alighted from his horse to take a more ceremonious leave of Kaisar Shah, son of Kih'dge Arselan, Sultan of Iconium, and who had married a daughter of Malek Adel, Kaisar Shah in return held the stirrup and assisted the Sol- dan to remount, while Aladin arranged his clothes, on which a bystander observed, " O, son of Ayoub, you need not now care what death you die; a prince of the house of Seljouc has helped you on horseback, and a descendant of the Atabek Zenghi has adjusted your garments." Seiffeddin, the father of Aladin, had been engaged in long and ruinous wars with the Sultan, and his friendship was never cordial. 2 d 3

These towers were similar in nature to those employed by Godfrey at the siege of Jerusalem, and even in an age when we hear familiarly of the destructive powers of our modern artillery, there is something imposing in the account of such gigantic engines; these were higher than the walls of the city, and each was capable of containing five hundred men. They consisted of three stories: in the first story were the battering rams; in the second, the Balistæ and Catapults, which threw darts and stones to the distance of one hundred and twenty-five feet. The atones were from three hundred to four hundred pounds weight; they crushed the roofs of houses, overturned the machines of the enemy, and shook the walls: the third and last story contained one hundred warriors, who were armed with axes, maces, &c, and protected by a roof from the stones and fire which were hurled from the engines of the besieged. It was also provided with a pont levis, or flying bridge, which could be let down upon the walls. These moving castles were raised upon wheels, and covered with leather hardened in vinegar, to render them impenetrable to common flame, and to the ordinary Greek fire. After the earth had been levelled, and a part of the fosse filled up, they were rolled forward by means of levers. See Mailly, Marin, Sţc. Note (f), page 138, line 121. To shivering want his own neh mantle gave. The banners of France were three, the royal or personal standard of the King, the " Chape de St. Martin," and the oriflamme. The royal standard was a square banner, or gonfalon, of a blue colour, and powdered with lilies of gold. This was usually entrusted to some vassal of valour and consequence, who was called the gonfalonier, a name in
later years confined to him who bears the standard of the Holy See. At the battle of Bouvines, the standard of Philip Augustus was borne by Gallon de Montigny, who, when the King was unhorsed, gave notice of his danger by lowering it several times. The " Chape de St. Martin," according to Le Gendre, was a banner of taffeta, on which the Saint was depicted, and which had acquired extraordinary virtues, from having been allowed to remain some time upon his tomb. Other writers assert that it was the mantle of the Saint, and some have pretended that it was worn by the Kings of France in battle. Others suppose it to have been die banner belonging to the Abbey of St. Martin of Tours, and others again contend that it was not a banner, but a coffer or portable pavilion, containing the relics of many saints, and among others those of St. Martin, which the Kings of' France held in the highest veneration. Whichever of these opinions may rest on the best authority, the presence of the Chape de St. Martin was supposed to ensure victory, and its place in battle was immediately after the royal standard. The oriflamme has been already considered, but the dignity of bearing it was sought by the most renowned knights, and contested with almost as much eagerness as the principal command, at least if we may judge from the instance of Arnoul d'Andrenhem, who under Charles the Fifth resigned his office of Maréchal of France, that he might exercise that of Pone Oriflamme. The bearer, however, had no authority, except over the troop at the head of which he carried his banner; but that troop consisted of all which chivalry could boast, of most noble and most valiant:—added to which, the oriflamme was always in the van, either in march or in battle, consequently in the post of danger and honour; and when it was present, even the banner of the King became of small account, and was called only the royal pennon. 2 ь 4
Nothing can more decidedly mark the respect in which the oriflamme was held, than the oath administered to the bearer. " You swear and promise, on the precious body of Christ Jesus, here present, and on the bodies of Monseigneur St. Denis and his companions, here also, that you will loyally, in your own person, guard and govern the oriflamme of our Lord the King, also present, to the honour and profit of himself and his kingdom, and that you will not abandon it, neither for the fear of death nor for any other cause, but that you will in all things do your duty as beseems a good and loyal knight towards your Sovereign and liege Lord."-~ See MaiUy, vol. i.

The francia or francisque, a kind of battle-axe, from which the Franks are supposed to have derived their name, as the Saxons did from the se-ax, a similar weapon which they used in battle. Some modern authors assert that the axe and bipennis were solely used by the Danes. Perhaps a weapon of this sort was originally employed by all the barbarous tribes of northern Europe, but relinquished in the progress of civilization; and the Danes being the last of the northern invaders, might also be the last to abandon it.— Smith's Antient Costume of England, Note (h), page 144, line 257. He moves not, speaks not, lives to pain alone. The general suffrage of mankind seems to have established Saladine as the greatest man of the age in which he lived; yet in the power of supporting any reverse of fortune, he shewed himself much inferior to his antagonist, Richard Cœur de Lion. Some historians have said that the English Monarch was never so great as in his dungeon of
Trivallis; but the Sultan of Damascus, whether from mental weakness, or constitutional infirmity, seems to have been sunk into a deplorable state of despondency by every defeat. The picture in the poem goes not beyond that which is drawn by his annalists, and after the loss of Acre, we have the testimony of the learned Abdollatiph to that morbid state of mind, which would not admit even the presence of his sons. This great physician, after having acquired by travel a knowledge of the learning and an' unties of India and Damascus, was then on his road to Egypt, and felt it a point of duty to pay his respects to the Sultan en route: but the unhappy Monarch was in a state which precluded his admission. M. Michaud's observations on the general character of Mahomedan courage are not inapplicable to this subject. " The reader may have remarked, in perusing this history, that the religion of Mahommed, all warlike as it is, does not inspire in its disciples that obstinate bravery, that perseverance under misfortune, that unbounded devotion, of which the history of the Crusades offers so many examples. The religion of the Musulmans requires the stimulus of victory to preserve its strength and violence. Trained in the blind doctrine of fatalism, they are accustomed to regard success or defeat as the decree of heaven. Victorious, they are full of courage and ardour; but when vanquished they allow themselves to be cast down, and feel no shame in yielding to an enemy, whom they regard as the instrument of destiny. Their courage is rarely excited by the desire of acquiring renown, and even in the moments of their military ardour, it is rather the fear of punishment than the thirst of glory that detains them in the field. The power to brave their foes must be derived from a chief whom they dread, and despotism appears necessary to their valour," —Vol. ii. p. 213,

The Gem of Giamschid, frequently alluded to by Oriental w nter&, is by many supposed to be a caibuncle, and this, idea is adopted by the author of Vathek; but, according to D'Herbclot, the Gem of Giamschid was a large cup oi vase, made of a single turquois, which was found by the Genii his subjects, when digging the foundations of Istakar. This vase has long been lost, Giamschid was the son of Caiomurs, the first of the Preadamite Sultans, who reigned over the Genii before the creation of man. He is, said to have been the inventor of wine, which, from its intoxicating qualities,, he named " the charming poison." Noter {ty pag« ш >!iiïe S5Q - And vanish'd m a pyi amid of light. l'he idea of this incident is taken from a passage m the Untoli t de Saladme, which ьа} s that тлщ fruitless atttmpt^
had been made by the besieged to set fire to the wooden castles of the besiegers, or to overturn them with stones. Saladine promised great rewards for their destruction; at last a young man of Damascus flattered himself that he would burn them by means of an inflammable matter of which he possessed the secret, and which was different fiom the common Greek fire. In reality, after having mixed various drugs with naptha or petroleum, in brazen vases, these vases were hurled against the castles, and consumed them m an instant. Michaud says that they were reduced to ashes, as though they had been struck by the lightnings of Heaven. In the Pièces Justificatives, at the end of his second volume, is an extract fiom the MS. Life of Saladme by Renaudot, which bears upon the subject. " It is certain," says M. Renaudot, " that the artificial fire, called Greek üıe, feude mer, or liquid fire, whose composition is found in the Gicek and Latin historians, was very different fiom that which the Eastern nations began to use at this peiiod, and of which the effect was_the more sui pnsmg, as its саиье was entnely unknown; for, while the common Greek fire was prepared with wax, pitch, sulphur, and other combustible matters, thepiincipal ingredient of this was naptha or peti oleum, of which there are natural spnngs in the neighbouihood of Bagdad, similar to those îemarked by the ancients near Ecbatana, on the confines of Media, and m other parts of Рема. It appears probable that the Orientals first made use of it at this siege (Acre), and that the Christians, fiom its resemblance, called it abo Gi eek fire, and believed it to be the same which was known throughout the Levant. The Greeks and Mahomedane afterwards continued to employ their respective fires, without communicating the secret to other nations. The Greeks distinguishing the naptha fire of the east by the name of Median fiie; ana tne Lairm> confounding- both under that of Greek fiie, m the &ame niannei ач thi
Orientals afterwards gave the appellation of naptha to the gunpowder by which it was superseded." M. Mailly enters into a digression on the subject of the Greek fire. Its effecte are doubtless exaggerated; and, though I have availed myself i n the Poem of such exaggerations, there are not perhaps many who will now seriously believe on the authority of some old historians, that it consumed the very stones, or tbat, while the tendency of all other flame is to aspire, this had at least an equal inclination to burn downwards. M. Mailly, whose work was published in 1780, states that some of hie contemporaries had pretended to a re-discovery of its composition. It was not ten years before that a person named Dupre, had died in the receipt of a pension paid him by the French Government on condition of burying his secret in oblivion. Mailly had himself known a physician, who had made the same discovery, or at least one similar, but to whose labours the ministry gave no encouragement, " a humanity," he adds, " as honourable to philosophy, as to our country; the only one perhaps, where persons in place may be found, sufficiently the friends of mankind, to forbear multiplying the sources of their destruction; and to remember, that if unhappily wars are sometimes necessary, infernal secrets should be left to infernal armies, and that we already possess too much, in the use of gunpowder!!" Tùe English Government would certainly have drawn upon itself the anathemas of M. Mailly, and have afforded a fine field for the display of his national vanity by its patronage of the Congreve rockets, had they then existed. Note (m), page 149, line 361, Oh! who but courts th' emprize, the glory rare? The conveyance of Greek or Median fire to the city was, throughout the siege of Acre, a service of great importance and danger. It was generally effected by means of swimmers

Who dared that chief in battle-shock to meet. Ermengard D'Aps was grand master of the Knights Hospitallers before the taking of Jerusalem, and enjoyed that dignity for more than five years.

Protects the mole, the shelter'd port commands. The form of Acre is triangular. It is defended by the sea on the north, western, and southern sides, and on the northeast or land side is guarded by walls and strong towers. At the northern extremity, or apex of the triangle is the Tour du Diable (Satan's Fort). In the middle of the line, and at a projecting angle, is the Tour Maudite (Accursed Tower), the scene of the most violent assaults. At the south-eastern ex. tremity, very near to the sea, is the Tower of David, or Tour du Patriarche; beyond this the wall extends a short distance into the sea, and is terminated by a small fort to which I find no distinguishing name. The sea encroaching on the southern side, or base of the triangle, forms a sort of bay defended by a mole, which springing from the shore near the southwestern corner, stretches half across, and is bounded by a
strong tower, built on an insulated rock. This rock was formerly the site of a temple of Jupiter, and the place where the priests retired to inspect the entrails of the victims. From the number of flies which were hence attracted to the rock arose its name of Tour des Mouches. I have endeavoured to retain the pleasanter part of the idea, and have called it tlie Tower of Sacrifice. I may perhaps here be permitted to make a short observation on the names of Acre and Ptolemais, respecting which much has been written. The former name, or at least such modification of it as arises from the diffèrent pronunciation in various languages, seems to have been both the ancient and modern appellation of the city,and it has been questioned whence it acquired that of Ptolemaïs. Some writers have suggested that this last name, though employed by the Greeks of the Lower Empire, and the Latin authors, may never have become general among the natives of the country. Vinesauf, I think, gives a satisfactory explanation. The old town of Acre, as appears from the remains of its walls, did not occupy more than the lower half of the triangle, and Vinesauf says that to the north or on the side nearest to the hill of Turon, was that part of the city called Ptolemais, having been more recently built. Note (p), page 165, line 734. Record his death, and Herod's impious vow. To the left of the mosque, on the north of the city of Acre, are the ruins of a building still known by the name of King Richard's Palace. Dr. Clarke calls its architecture gothic, and from the representations which I have seen, the arches are decidedly pointed. Two lofty arches and part of the superstructure remain; the cornice is ornamented with enormous stone busts, of very distorted countenances, whence the building has derived its name; these being supposed to represent the heads of the Saracens whom the Lion-hearted Monarch killed, or ate, according to the romance. Dr. Clarke
thinks İt more probable that it has been a church of St. John the Baptist, and erected during the time when the Christians were in possession of Acre, whether before or after its capture by Saladine. It is possible that from this very structure the city assumed its title of St. Jean D'Acre. Note (r), page 168, line 790. What though a random spear had pierced his side.

And thank the care that rais'd its walls so high. The Christian campât Acre, by means of successive additions and entrenchments had become (iike the town of Santa Fé, built by Ferdinand and Isabella under the walls of Grenada), almost the rival of the city it besieged. It contained streets and churches: not indeed such as would have been erected in a situation where they were likely to bc permanent, but such as a residence of three years must have supplied with all the necessaries, and even some of the luxuries of that half-civilized age. These were incessantly filled with warriors from almost every nation of Christendom. The Arabian writers say that so many languages were spoken in the crusading army, that they could not find interpreters for the captives; and in another place, that the camp was so well fortified, that not even a bird could get in.

Conrad of Montferrat first \ r isited Palestine at the time oi the second crusade, when his father with his four sons ac* companied his uncle, the Emperor Conrad the Third, on that unfortunate expedition. He afterwards distinguished himself in Italy m the contests between the Emperors and the Holy See, conquered some of the Islands of the Adriatic, which he sold to Venice, and then passing a second time to Constantinople, he assisted Isaac Angelus to establish himself on the imperial throne, having killed in battle the leader of the rebels. The sister of this monarch was at first a bait for his ambition, but finding that his marriage gained him nothing but the title of Cæsar, and the right of wearing purple slippers, he left the unhappy Theodora, and saded to Palestine in quest of more substantial laurels. He arrived at lyre m a single ship, on the very day when it Wdb engaged to surrender to Saladme if not relieved. The Sultan threatened to place the old Marquis of Montferrat, who had been some time his prisoner, m front of his army, and to expose him to the arrows of the besieged if the town did not ¡surrender, but Contad was either too
well convinced of the humanity of Saladine to fear his threat, or was insensible to the appeal, and replied that if the Soldan were barbarous enough to cause the death of one who had surrendered on his parole, he should glory in being the son of a martyr. Tyre remained his own; he assumed the title of its Prince, and enlarged its territory. Vinesauf says, that he had also another wife in Germany, high born and beautiful; I think her name was Emilia; but many of the heroes of the crusades would not have been sorry to claim at least one of the indulgences of the Mahommedan law.

A similar incident occurs in the history of the Caliph Vatltek, where Carathis introduces small pots of venomous serpents into her apartments, to destroy her unsuspecting visitors. The Oriental writers agreed, that if the Dromond had arrived in safety, the Christians would never have been able to take Acre. The Romance has the same idea: " For, hadde the drowmound i-passyd the sec, And comen to Acres fro Kyng Richard; An hondryd wyntyr afftyrward, For alle Crystene-men under sunne, Hadde nevyr Acres ben i-wiinne!"

Of Richard's axe the romance says: u King Richard, I understond Or he went out of Englond, Let him make an ax for the nones, To breke therwith the Sarasyns bones.

In the portrait of Richard on the first of his seals, the upper circle of his helmet is surrounded by an ornament which is supposed to be the flower of the Planta Genista, or hroom, whence the house of Anjou took the surname of Plantagenet. This device originated either with Geoffrey Earl of Anjou (the grandfather of our Richard the First), who is said to have worn a sprig of broom in his hat when on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, or with his father Fulk of Anjou, the fourth King of Jerusalem, who on his way thither used a branch of broom or furze as a scourge. Henry the Second of England, son of the above named Geoffrey, was tiie first of our Kings who bore the name of Plantagenet. He is reported to have placed a sprig of broom in his helmet, on taking the vow of the crusade.

The palanders or horse transports were drawn on the beach, and the horses introduced by a sort of shelving platform, which was afterwards turned up to close the opening. This door was then well secured, and was entirely under water while the vessels were at sea.

Of the immense booty which fell into the hands of the first Crusaders, at the battle of Antioch, nothing was so highly prized, or excited so much admiration, as the superb tent of Kerboga, King of Mosul, one of their principal antagonists. It was adorned with gold and silver in every part, was of such vast extent as easily to contain two thousand men, was divided 'into streets, and defended by towers, like a fortified town. This tent, the only one perhaps of the kind which 2 e 4

Another splendid tent is named by the historians of the first crusade; it was sent by an Armenian Prince, Nichosias, as a present to Godfrey, but fell into an ambuscade prepared by Pancrates, who sent it to Bohemond, as a gift from himself. Godfrey reclaimed it, and it became the subject of much altercation between the two leaders, till Bohemond was at last compelled to yield.

Among other things to which the two Monarchs had bound themselves, when they met at Vezelay to make arrangements for their journey, was an exact division of conquest during the Crusade. Philip therefore claimed one-half of Cyprus from Richard: but that monarch insisted that though they were bound to share whatever they should acquire together, Philip had no right over that which was won without his aid; nevertheless he was willing to divide the island with him, if Philip would in like manner give him half the county of Flanders, which had just reverted to its Suzerain by the death of Theodoric, who expired at Acre on the very day of Richard's arrival. To this Philip would not agree, and the цшггЫ was never perfectly accommodated. Note (o), page 204, line 641. From Fulk I also spring — this biting blade. Fulk, fourth King of Jerusalem, was by his first marriage father to Geoffrey Earl of Anjou, so that Richabd stood in exactly the same relation to Fulk with Baldwin the Fifth, they being both his great-grand-children ,· and if it were to be considered that a female was unworthy to fill the throne of Jerusalem (as had been asserted at the accession of Sybilla), he became the legitimate heir.

The stings of death for those the sxvord shall spare. lîiCHAiîD, almost immediately on his arrival before Acre, addressed himself to the consideration of the means likely to compel its surrender; and one of his most efficacious manoeuvres was the turning the course of a river which supplied the city with water. This circumstance has possibly been the occasion of some difficulty into which geographers
have fallen respecting the river Belus. This river formerly so celebrated for its silicious sands, and the accidental dibco- very of glass, is joined near its mouth by another rivei > which being figured in some charts as a separate stream, doubts arose as to which really deserved the name of Belus. More recent surveys having proved their junction, it is probable that the lesser stream was that which formerly supplied Acre with water, and which Richard diverted from ıtb course. M.

Note (r), page 212, line 825. A thousand marks proclaimed to him should lure him hotne. I avail myself of this incident to notice a characteristic difference between the third Crusade and those which pre-
ceded it- Louis the Seventh of France, and the Emperor Conrad, followed the track of Peter the Hermit and Godfrey of Bouillon. They had to contend with all the fatigues of a long and difficult journey, with all the miseries of famine, and all the dangers arising from open hostility and secret treachery; in Hungary, Bulgaria, and the Greek provinces bordering on Constantinople. These evils redoubled, when, passing into Asia Minor, they became entangled iu mountain passes, and exposed to the incessant attacks of the Turks, under the dominion of the Seljouc Sultans of Iconium. Scarcely a third of their numerous armies reached Palestine, and those who did not perish in the journey, or whose sufferings did not cause them to turn back- before they attained the Holy Land, arrived there in a deplorable state of exhaustion and poverty. Destitute of provisions, of money, frequently of arms and clothing, warriors of high birth, and ample European possessions, were often reduced to subsist on the charity of wealthier or more provident leaders; and all were in need of assistance. Frederic Barbarossa, whose lamentable expedition forms a part of the third Crusade, still pursued the beaten track; and even the courage and ability which had been displayed in a long life of war, could not save himself and his army from the fate of their precursors. Philip Augustus and Richard of England, however, took warning from the sad example, and emulating the adventurous spirit displayed by the Norwegian Sigurd, and other warriors of the Baltic, they dared to entrust themselves and their armies to the ocean, and hired for the voyage the galleys of Genoa and Piso; for Venice, though then the first of maritime powers, took little part in the crusades, till her own interests were attacked in the contest for Constantinople Some dangers were encountered in the course of the voyage, part of which may be reckoned among the ordinary casual-
book \. ties of the sea, but of which the greater proportion should be ascribed to the imperfection of the galleys, and to the ignorance of pilots. Still the French and English crusaders encountered neither toil nor privation, and the nobles transported into the East the comforts and many of the luxuries of their feudal castles. The passion for the chase, which then began to rage in France, and had even shewed symptoms of its future dominion in England, prompted many to carry with them their bounds and their falcons. The bunting equipages of several were even scandalously magnificent, and the Syrian nobles thought that their new allies seemed better prepared to wage war with the wild birds and beasts of their country, than with the Saracens. The numbers of dogs and falcons belonging to some individuals is almost beyond belief, and Philip Augustus was determined not to be outdone by his vassals. The bird whose loss is mentioned in the poem, was the subject of a serious embassy to Saladine, the conditions of its restoration were debated with all the solemnity of a treaty, and a sum of money was ottered, which would have been sufficient for the ransom of many christian knights. A fact which gave just offence to those whose relations or friends were prisoners to the Soldan. The private interests of Philip Augustus, and the lukewarm- ness or disagreement of other princes, prevented the third crusade from being equally glorious in ita result with that of Godfrey, but it was distinguished by more of discipline and conduct, and was free from those disasters, those deplorable scenes of human vice and suffering, which cause the mind to revolt from the history of almost every other expedition to the Holy Land. In the preceding crusades, ti e examples arc distressingly numerous, and, in those which followed, the names of Constantinople and Damiettaare sufficient to prove that the leaders of the Latin armies, brave and pious as they were, had not yet learned to be generals.

Note (к), page 249, line 56é. Now prove him false that called his King unjust, The authority for this little episode is in Vinesauf, who records that one of bis knights voluntarily received the blow which was aimed at Richard, and also the circumstance of the Monarch's reconciliation after the battle, with one who fiad previously offended him, but whom he forgave on account of his valour.—He also makes frequent mention of Baldwin do Carrio (now Carew) iv ho must have been either the son or nephew of William, Castellan of Windsor, whose fidelity was so conspicuous during the absence of Richard. —This William was hereditary governor of Windsor Castle, that office having been confirmed to his father by the Empress Maude, and from it his family took the surname of Windsor, which is still retained by their descendants the Earls of Plymouth. That of Carrio, perpetuated in the Carews of Cornwall and Devon, was derived from a fief which William inherited in right of his mother.—This family is by some antiquaries derived from the Dukes of Tuscany, who are said to have passed from Florence to Normandy, but its descent appears pretty well established from Othoer, a powerful lord under King Alfred, and of Norwegian ancestry. Gerald, great grandson of Othoer, was sent by Henry the Second against Owen lthys, Prince of Gwyneth or North Wales, whom he reduced to submission, and was made Castellan of Pembroke, under Montgomery Earl of Pembroke, Having also slain Owen, son of Cadugan ap Blethyn, chief Lord of Cardiganshire, he was made president of the county of Pembroke, chamberlain to tlie King, and married the Princess Nesta, daughter of the vanquished Prince of Gwyneth.

Of these stories the most interesting is that of Lilla Heiluma, who after many sufferings was sold to Hadgi Abderah- mari, afterward'ambassador in England; and by her beauty and gentleness not only induced her master to marry her, butto grant her many indulgences not often accorded to the Moorish females, and among others, that of receiving intelligence from her native country, and relieving the wants of her farnily, who had fallen into distress.

The speech of Philip Augustus is very nearly that which history ascribes to him; there appears little doubt that his sickness was affected, and that his religious ardour having never been great, his reasons for returning to Europe were purely political. These were the death of Theodoric Earl of Flanders, in consequence of which the Earldom reverted to ftis Suzerain, but which he was in danger of losing, if not at hand to take c ι < j of his interests; and the convenient opportunity which the absence of Cœur de Lion afforded him for attacking his ill-defended states, and gratifying the jealousy with which he regarded the superior wealth and martial fame of his rival. The friendship of Philip Augustus had been fatal to Richard while only Count of Poitou, for it led him into rebellion against his father, and his hatred in after life was Ids perpetual bane. The Crusade produced a faint and false accord; each had bound himself by tlie most solemn oaths to a participation of peril, of glory, and of conquest; to defend as his own the possessions of his comrade, both at home and abroad; and the Church had rivetted these vows by the most deadly imprecations on all that should violate " the Peace of God." Yet were all these vows made but to be broken; real friendship needs no such covenants, and it has been ever obvious that the most solemn engagements are as wax before the flames of ambition. Richard and Philip were seldom together for three days without a quarrel; and though, as at Messina, the influence of the Holy Cause 2 f 2
terminatcd these discords by a renewal of their vows, yet, as Michaud observes, there could be but little faith in a friendship which it was necessary to obtest so often. As soon as Richard arrived at Acre, the contest about Cyprus rekindled the sparks of jealousy, and the two Kings never once joined their forces against the foe; the most that could be obtained was that, one should attack the army of Saladine while the other assaulted the city; but on more than one occasion, as has been already noticed, Philip would have retired with disgrace before the Soldan, if Richard, forgetting his animosity, had not withdrawn his troops from the town and redeemed the victory. His martial superiority was thus rendered but more manifest. It was the duty of each leader to support his troops: and the monthly allowance which Richard granted to each man, was one-third more than that bestowed by Philip. It was natural that all who lived upon 4i debateable land" (and when we remembei how many of the fairest provinces in France belonged to RrcHAKD, these could not be few), should be eager to profess themselves the followers of the most munificent master: Philip therefore accused RiciiAim of seducing his soldiers from their allegiance. In a word, he had less irritability than the English Monarch, but as he also wanted his frankness, he seems never to have forgotten their former discontents, even at the moment when he again pledged an inviolable friendship; and when envy was in secret rankling in his heart, new grounds for quarrel could never belong absent. Note (b), page 273, line 54. Again to pledge ike vows of Vezelay. Vezeiay is a small town in Burgundy, not far from Auxerre, and was the place where Philip and Richard met to make final arrangements for the crusade. The vows taken at Vezelay were nearly the same as those by which the Crusaders; at the council of Clermont, bound themselves
to abstain írom aH private or Christian warfare, and by which all the Princes and Nobles became reciprocal guardians of each others dominions during the crusade; such as might remain at home, or might return before the rest, pledging themselves to respect the rights of the absentees. Philip and Richard made a farther agreement, that neither should abandon the crusade without the consent of the other; it was hence that Ricuahd, when that consent was asked, required as a conditio^ that Philip should again bind himself not to commit any outrage on his undefended states, of which his eagerness to return made him justly suspicious; and that Philip, in reply, demanded the renewal of Richards homage for the extensive fiefs which he held of the French crown; so extensive, indeed, that when it is remembered that neither Burgundy, nor Lorraine, nor Flanders, then belonged to the Kings of France, it may well be asked, on what pretensions they founded their right to the title of ·· King of Kings," and first of the Monarcha of Europe. Note (c), page 275, line 91, Ye are not worthy to behold her walls! This memorable expression has been ascribed to Richard by the historians of the times, though they differ in their account of the occasion which called it forth. Some say, that during his residence at Jaffa, he penetrated, on one of his romantic hunting excursions, to a hill whence he had a distant view of the towers of Jerusalem. He was then preparing to return to Europe, and the Holy City seemed to upbraid him with his want of power to relieve her, and witb his meditated desertion of her cause. He wept, and veiling his head in his mantle, exclaimed, " that those who could not deliver, were unworthy to behold her." Other writers address this expression, as I have done, in reproach to some of his companions, who deserted their vows for the deliverance of the sepulchre. 2 f .'i
Note (d), page 275, line 98. Paid the dire forfeit of his broken word. This is the least graceful feature of King Richard's life, and that which I have felt most difficulty in managing. To have passed it over entirely, would scarcely have been allowable, but after much consideration, I determined to touch it as slightly as possible. I could not hope to imitate Wir. Southey's extraordinary power of identifying myself and my feelings with those of the age or country of which I treated, neither could I expect or wish, in the nineteenth century, to obtain the sympathy of my readers in an attempted extenuation of massacre. Yet it would surely have been as unjust to RiciiARD, as it was inconsistent with a story of which he was the hero, to hold forth to the detestation of posterity, an act not only excused, but applauded by the fanaticism of his contemporaries. The facts were briefly these: when Acre was surrendered, about 4,000 captives remained in the hands of the two Sovereigns, Richard and Philip. A treaty had been entered into with Saladine for the payment of a large sum of gold, the surrender of the wood of the True Cross. &c. &c. on condition of which they were to receive their liberty: but if he failed to fulfil the treaty before a certain day, their lives were forfeit. The day expŕred, the conditions were unfulfilled; a good deal of fruitless négociation followed, which only led to mutual exasperation; and, after waiting three weeks, Richard, who was preparing to commence his march, gave orders for the massacre. The numbers who are reported to have fallen vary from 1,500 to 4,000 or 6,000; I am inclined to think the lowest number the most correct. Many of the more wealthy had been already ransomed, or were reserved for ransom; and Philip, who had in the meantime departed to Tyre, took his share of the captives with him. Richard often sent for them, but he who was about to leave Pales-
) tine bcenicd rathei inclined to obtain money fot their freedom, than to ¡strike teirot by their muider, and it at last he gave them up to his rival, it doe& not appear that he did so previous to the massacre. Aboulpharagms says., " that the tune being expired, Saladine sent to the Franks, ' Dismiss all the Arabs who are ш your bonds, and 1 will give you the third part of the gold, and hostagCb for the other two , 01 otherwise, ye shall give me hostages for the third part which ye have received.' But the Franks said, « Our word alone is sufficient to you, and oui honour. why should we give bostagCh ^ Then the heart of Saladme was hardened, neithei would he consent, and the Fianks bemg enraged, bound all the Aiabt. with cords>, and leading them foith from the city on to the lull, having clothed them in vile garments, they ran upon them with dtawn bwordb, and blew them m sight of the Moslem camp.' The author of the Life of St. Lotus relates the event ш a manna »huh lays the fitst guilt of massacre on Saladine, and implicates Philip in the retaliation inflicted by the Christians. " Cmque mille hommes quii y avoit de garnison demeurèrent pnson- niers, à condition dette relâchés en faisant rendi e la vi aie croix, et les esclaves Chrétiens: sinon qu'ils demeuroicnt a ia discretion des vainqueurs. Mais baladin, ayant fa / mourir un giand nombre des pi isonnut л qu d avoit dc son tòte. bien loin de tenir la capitulation, ces 5,000 hommes euieiit tous la tote tianthée, un moitié an nom de Phdippi, tt Tcutie an nom de Richírd.

The Romance of Ccs-ijr de Lion, which b) its naïveté renders amusing those scenes of hoiror which would othei wise disgust, mci eases the numbei of the captiv еь to 60,000, commands then destruction by the \oice of an angel and dwells with peculiar pleasure on the edifying eftuston ot Pagan blood.

receive ransom for his prisoners, than to follow the good example of putting them to death. I ought not to omit, that Saladine was certainly not slow in making reprisals on the Christian captives in his hands; and Mr. Sharon Turner, in his admirable sketch of the Third Crusade, relates an interesting anecdote of a young warrior whom the Soldan kept for two days with him in his tent, conversing with him, and endeavouring to convert him, or to find some reason vhich might excuse to his own bigotry the disposition which he felt to exempt him from the fate of his companions. At last he gave orders for his death, an instance of cold blooded cruelty, of which Mr. Turner seems to think, that Richard, ferocious as he has been deemed, would have been incapable.

There were at least three embassies sent to Conrad at Tyre; of these the Bishop of Salisbury, Otho of Burgundy, and Roger de Quine} -, Earl of Winchester, formed part; but as the several négociations are not important to the story, I have mentioned but one, and engaged in it those personages that best suited my subject. The Bishop of Beauvais was certainly with Conrad at the period when he was engaged in treaty with Saladme, He was one of the most distinguished for valour among the martial prelates of ше age, but he did not, like Hubert of Salisbury, and the venerable Baldwin, Archbishop of Canterbury, combine the clerical virtues with the prowess of a warrior. During the captivity of Richard, the Bishop proved himself one of his most malignant enemies. Note (f), page 276, line 119. Meanwhile the pilgrim host their course began. The historians of' the time are followed in this arrangement
of' the troops. Whatever was most precious moved in the centre, surrounded by the knights of England and Normandy; while the auxiliary cavalry, ifl may so call the smaller troops belonging to other nations, formed the front and ìear, and the infantry protected the flanks. The Templars and Hospitallers frequently exchanged places, but one was always in advance of the army, while the other formed the rear-guard. They were engaged in constant skirmishes with the infidels, especially after leaving Cesarea, and many acts of signal valour are recorded. The disposition and conduct of the troops in this long and difficult march, though not one of the most splendid achievements of our lion-hearted King, is among those which have gained him tlie greatest credit in modern times, and proves that in his military arrangements, he was not deficient in that prudence which has so often been denied to him. He is allowed to have been the first who in the age of chivalry consented to make use of infantry as a body, and who knew how to place it to advantage. Note (g), page 277, line 132. And, sheathed in stubborn mad, the fianks defend. The Salacene complained in this march that their javelins and arrows made no impiession on the Christian yeomanry, w horn they described as men of steel, and ¡said that a javelin which would havepieiced one of their men to the back-bone, dropped powerless from the European coats of mail.

Rhodes, this important plant was first made known to Europe by the Crusades. The soldiers of Raymond of Tholouse in 1098 discovered it in the neighbourhood of Tripoli, and when tlie march to Jerusalem was determined, they were with difficulty torn from the novel luxury. The mode of extracting the sugar was simple, but appears to have been efficacious. The inhabitants, when the canes were ripe, pounded them in a mortar, and then permitted the juice to coagulate in a cake ' c whiter than saltorsnow." The " Canna Mellis," as it was called, (the Crusaders seeming to consider its juice as another species of honey) was soon transplanted into Sicily, where it appears to have flourished, and to have given rise to the extravagant passion for sweetmeats which existed in Italy in the fourteenth century, and of which traces may yet he found in the Carnival. Egypt was the principal source whence this consumption was supplied. From Sicily tlie culture of the sugar-cane passed to Grenada, thence to Madeira, and from Madeira to Brazil, whence it spread over the New World. Note (m), page 279, line 181. All lovely yet appear'd that chosen land. The present appearance of Palestine corresponds so little with the glowing description of " a land flowing with milk and honey," or with the bunch of grapes which attested its fertility Co the Children of Israel, that most of the writers on the Crusades have thought it necessary to enter into some details respecting its past and present state. A long and narrow tract of sandy coast, bounded by rocks and deserts, and but imperfectly and partially watered by mountain torrents, which, while they spread lavish fertility in their immediate neighbourhood, leave tfie rest a waste, conveys no adequate idea of the Land of Promise; the chosen Land, which was selected by Divine Will as the residence of his favourite people; the scene of his miraculous interpositions
in their behalf, and finally the incarnation of his Son, and the redemption of mankind. The religion of Mahommed, like the locusts which visit most of' the regions in which it predominates, seems to spread devastation in its course. The comparison maybe fanciful, but it is true, that while Christianity is on every side ameliorating the face of nature, in the same proportion that it improves the social condition of mankind, draining the bog, levelling the mountain, overcoming the rigour of the frozen north, or the drought of tropical climes, Mahommudumsm, the religion of war, of oppression and cruelty, has been long at strife with the bounty of nature in some ofthefulrott portions of the globe. Even the provident labours of their ancient cultivators are neglected and despised. The canals of Egypt are suffered to go to decay, nor can the diminution of that belt of verdure which still clothes the bounteous Nile, warn the careless and oppressed inhabitants to oppose in time the encroachments of the desert upon that Granary of the Ancient World. In Palestine, the descriptions of the Crusaders seem to present a middle point between its former beauty and iti present btate of neglect. It had suffered much and often, from war and pillage; and the martial >pirk of feudal discipline in a kingdom struggling for existence was nearly as unfavourable to the husbandman, as the rapacious inroads of the Turks; yet there had been intervals in which it had revived, and its beauty, though blighted, was not destroyed. í cannot resist the temptation of subjoining to this noie the comment of a literary friend. " The fertility of that country depends upon moisture and shade; humidity is encouraged by trees, it has never been observed that the fatal and predefined blow was given to Palestine by Titus. To frame those immense works with which he assailed the capital, he cut down gardens, groves, and forests, for many leagues around. Deprived of shade, the ground has ever bince remained scorched and barren. Ibr no attempts were or
could be made to replant, &c This, in a word, is the reason of tlie barren state of the country." Note (n), page S80, line 198. To Anna's .shrine their duteous homage pay.

It is said always to turn its blossoms to the sun, and to follow him through the skies: but this " fond idolatry" is so much more conspicious in the common American sun-ilower, which has in addition the advantage to resemble the object of its adoration, that it has sometimes caused confusion; and a celebrated Italian artist, in painting the story of Ciytie has introduced the »un-flower instead ot' the heliotrope, Ovid describes the flower with sufficient exactness: Perqué novem luces expers unda'quc cihique, llore mero, lachrymisqno suis jcjuiiia pavit: Nee se mov it humo.

Here ambush' d fraud might lurk, nor lurk in vaiti, The country between Cesarea and Jaffa is one of the most difficult and dangerous which an army can have to struggle with. On the left is that prolongation of the chain of Lebanon, known by the general name of Mount Sharon, though in parts it borrows that of Napolose, of Sichern, and other places in the vicinity. A straggling forest, composed entirely of cerrial oak, extends over the sides of the hills, and sometimes approaches very near to the sea; the intermediate space is broken by rocks and torrents, whose stony beds are scarcely less difficult to cross in the summer, than their furious waves in winter. A French traveller (M. Paultre) compares this tract to that extraordinary region in the neighbourhood of Fontainebleau, which any of my readers who have had a
taste of its cross-roads cannot fail to remember. Large blocks of calcareous stone, grey without, from the effect of weather, but white at their more recent fractures, protrude on every side through the soil, and force the stunted trees to assume a thousand ungraceful forms. Indeed they appear rather the remains of a nobler forest, crushed by these gigantic masses, than to have sprung up around them. The forest of Sharon, of" Arsouf, of Napolose, of Ascalon, or of Jaffa, for it bears all these names, is about six and thirty miles long, and from seven to nine broad. Many recent writers on the subject have exerted themselves to prove that this is the spot whence the leaders of the first crusade derived materials for the construction of their warlike engines; and which Tasso has embellished with so much of romantic fancy. Their arguments appear to be well supported; the situation of the wood of Sharon answers with tolerable precision to that of the Enchanted Forest, which was formerly supposed to have had no existence but in the imagination of the poet · and the idea derives new force from its being the only place within any probable distance from Jerusalem which could have afforded timber for the purposes of the siege. The more the Poem of Tasso is compared with the history of the time, and the geographical localities of Palestine, the more does his scrupulous accuracy become manifest: an accuracy the more surprising when it is remembered how much less of foreign countries or of ancient history was generally known, than in our more enlightened days, and that pei haps few of his readers would have detected or condemned any departure from historical truth.

Alasia, or Alice, or as some have called her Adelaïs, Princess of France, and sister to Philip Augustus, was unhappily betrothed in infancy to Richard, afterwards King of Fnglund, and was sent to the court ofHenrj the Second, to be educateli for bur future husband. When the Princesa grew up, Rick viid demanded his bride, but Henry would not yield her. Richaud rebelled against his father, and joined with Philip Augustus, who espoused his quarrel; the armies met at Gisors, and were on the point of coming to an engagement, notwithstanding the remonstrances of Pandul- plms, the Pope's legate, the same to whom King John afterwards surrendered his crown. The impetuous Richard was not to he persuaded out of a quarrel, in which he ielt that justice was certainly on his side, though his rebellion was a crime, and in the heat of his passion, he lifted his spear as if to strike the Legate. In the meantime a thunderstorm arose, and the thunderbolt feil between the livo ari.iics. This extiaordinary circumstance, which may be naturally accounted for b) the attractive influence of the polished arms and armour on the electric matter, was regarded as tho manifest interposition of offended heaven. A peace was soon concluded; Henry consented to create Rich v h d Duke oi' Xornnmdy, to acknowledge his right to lhe succession, which he hud wished to alter in behalf of his favourite John, and to give up Alasia at a fixed time. The latter clause he never fulfilled. Ue also rene« ed bis vow of the Crusade, wliile Philip Augustus, Ricuahd. and most of the Barons, took or resumed tbe Cross.

Ricuajîd is however üiu'd to have given Philip a satisfactory reason for his change of purpose, in the discovery that his fattier had detained Alasia from him, on account of' a criminal passion which he himself entertained for the young Princess. He gave proofs of her having even borne a son to Hemy, and Philip was fain to close the quarrel; and to thank the knightly honour of Riciiakd, which prevented him from making the scandal public. Alusia was afterwards mentioned in the dispute at .Messina, but she is never named as a cause of feud in the after-wars of the Kings, though they were undertaken by Philip, on pretext of recovering her dower of Gisons, and the Vexin, which Richard would not yield.

This, extraordinary man was the Abbé Joachim, who after hi.s return from Jerusalem retired to the mountains of Calabria, where he passed for a Prophet. In austerity of manners and life, he affected to emulate St. John the Baptist. His pilgrimage to the Holy Land had been blest with visions, and Christ himself hacì taught him to understand the Apocalypse, and to read there, as ín a faithful history, all that was to pass on earth. The account of him may be found in Hoveden. He at last incurred the censures of the Church, but at the time of Richard's voyage he was in the full odour of sanctity, and the Monarch's superstition was piqued to see the fancied saint. He did not however go to Calabria, but sent for Joachim to Messina, where he was questioned as to the result of the Crusade. Joachim said that Saladine was one ol the seven heads of the Dragon in the Apocalypse, and predicted that Jerusalem should be delivered seven years after the conquest of the Soldan.

Amrou, a general of the Caliph Omar, won Egypt from the Emperor Heraclius, and in the place where he encamped {near to Babylon, which still existed) he built a new town, called Mars Fastat, the City of Tents, in which the governor of the province afterwards resided, till Egypt was conquered by Djouhar, in the name of Moez, the Fatimite Caliph who reigned in Africa. Djouhar awaited in his camp the arrival of his master. He caused it to be surrounded with a strong wall, which was soon filled with palaces and mosques, and grew into a town, which he called Káhira, or Al Káhira, the Victorious (corrupted by tlie Christians into Cairo), and Mars Fostat thenceforward went by the name of Old Káhira. Saladine, after his establishment in Egypt, determined to build a wall, which should enclose both the new and old town. This labour was continued during his life principally under the eye of Karacous, who was governor of Káhira, till summoned to the defence of Acre: but the successors of the Soldan neglected to complete it. Saladine also raised a superb mosque over the tomb of the Imam Shafci, founder of one of the principal orthodox sects of Islam, and added to it an hospital for the poor, and a college for theology, history, poetry, medicine, and arithmetic; at the same time he constructed the Castle of Káhira, or the Castle of the Mountain, the only place of defence which now exists in Egypt. It was celebrated for its extent and magnificence, and the ruins which still remain are interesting. The arches are pointed, Joseph's Well is another monument of the reign of Saladine, and was called after him, for the Soldan was proud of his name of Yusuf, or Joseph, which he inherited from his grandfather, and he loved to trace his descent from the Patriarch himself.— See l' Histoire dc Saladine, Sçc.

Saladine was successful in every campaign, and Saleh, who feared to he given up to the victor, endeavoured to make peace with him. After the treaty was signed, and Saladine was in consequence preparing to withdraw his army from the siege of Aleppo, л young Princess arrived in the camp, escorted by a great number of slaves. She endeavoured to throw herself' at the feet of tlie Solda?), but he who recognised the daughter of Noureddin, raised her, and inquired what she wished. She asked the safety of her brother, and the restitution of' the fortress of Ezaz, which Saladine had recently won by a bharp siege. He granted her request with courtesy, una added many valuable presents. Some time after this, when Saleh and his protector the King of Mosul were both dead, Saladine continued the war; and Mazoud, son of the latter, being besieged in his capital, had recourse to the same means which had before moved tlie pity and blunted the sword oí' the conqueror. He sent the daughter of Noureddin, accompanied by his own mother and many noble ladies, to implore again the clemency of Saladine, and the restoration of the towns of Mesopotamia. This step was considered as a mark of the greatest submission, and from the humanity and generosity of' the Sultan, its success was confidently anticipated But Mazoud deceived himself. Saladine had found him too troublesome an enemy to let slip his prey in the very moment of success. He received the Sultanas with kindness, and with all the honours due to their rank; but in treaties and
tears и ere vaui , he was inflexible ibi the first time. On this ¡subject M. Marin observes, " that to the political spirit of the present times it would appear surpibing that a hero should yield his conquests at the tears of a few women, for they asked no 1еьь than the kingdom of Mesopotamia, Nevertheless, the manners of a nation which we are accustomed to call baibarous, caused the firmness of the Soldan to be regarded as an act of the greatest harshnesss. Many Doctors of the Law, although his subjects, dai ed publicly to reproach hım m their v. 11 Lings, and it ıs. ι emarkabie that he him- bclf repented of what he consideied an act of inhumanity."

The others are Walkelin Earl of Ferrers, Robert Tru schot, Henry, Cou n t of Champagne, Joeceline dc Montou-*, the Count of Clermont and Hubert Bishop of Salisbury. Conrad of Montferrat bears the odium of having at least increased this famine by withholding the provkions which it was in his power to furnish from Tyre; and Vinesauf devotes no less than twelve sections to α description of its horrors, concluding each with execrations against the ob-
noxious Marquis, towards whom, indeed, he never omits any opportunity of shewing his detestation. But while he gives so much space to the especial abuse of Conrad, he seems to have hated Leopold to completely aa to wish to rob him even of the immortality of infamy, and notwithstanding his many gallant actions in the Crusade, he never once names, even in a catalogue, that arch-enemy of his own heroic sovereign. He does indeed say that it was an addition to the grief of the English, that Richard was captive in Osterricia, rather than in Germany; but even there he never hints that the Duke had been in Palestine. Note, page 330, line 513. His lineal pride, and Montmorency's name. Tlie Montmorencies derive their name from an incident in the time of Charles Martel.

[^1]: On the eastern coast of the Mediterranean is a small bay, of which Mount Carmel forms the southern extremity, while that to the north is occupied by the city of Acre. The plain, on the south, is watered by two rivers; the Belus, whose sands were sought from a great distance for the manufacture of glass, and the “ancient river, the river Kishon;” but like most of the Syrian streams, they roll a torrent in the Spring, and they nearly disappear in the Autumn. Acre, washed on two sides by the sea, is protected on the third by strong walls, and a succession of massy towers. The Christians, at the commencement of the siege, pitched their camp on the hill of Turon, to the north-east of the town; but this camp being enlarged by the arrival of successive bodies of Crusaders, it extended gradually from Belus to the sea, and almost matched the city in the strength of its ramparts. To the south-east, and a little more remote, but still within the Belus, is a conical hill, called Mahumeria, or the Hill of the Mosque, and by some writers, the Tomb of Memnon. Here were the headquarters of Saladine; but much of his army seems to have been encamped on the heights of Kaisan, and in winter it retired to the yet remoter mountains of Kharouba. Acre was therefore enclosed by the Christian army, which, in its turn, was enclosed by that of Saladine.

[^2]: “Neuf rangs de morts couvraient le terrein qui s’étend entre la colline at la mer, et chaque rang était de mille guerriers.” — <i>Michaud from Bahaheddin</i>

[^3]: Michaud, vol. ii. p. 70, in speaking of the Turkish mode of warfare in their inroads on the kingdom of Jerusalem, says, that when successful, they returned to their country loaded with spoil, and singing these words:— “The Koran is plunged in joy, the Gospel in tears.”

[^4]: The Emperor Conrad the IIId. of Germany lost his army, by the treachery of the Turks of Iconium, in the mountains of Armenia. Frederic Barbarossa overcame the Turks, but perished near the same place in the river Saleph, believed by some writers to be the Cydnus, whose icy waters had nearly proved fatal to Alexander the Great.

[^6]: When Geoffrey de Lusignan heard that Sybilla had made his brother Guy King of Jerusalem, he replied, with more of frankness than fraternal affection,
“If she have made Him King, she would have made a God of me.”

[^7]: Isabella, married to Humfrey Count of Thoron, was the daughter of Amalric by his second wife, Mary, sister to Isaac Comnenus.

[^8]: Before Saladine released his royal prisoner, he bound him by and oath to resign all future pretensions to the throne of Jerusalem; but Lusignan was no sooner at liberty than his desire of vengeance awakened, and Heraclius made no difficulty of freeing him from his vow, declaring, not only that compulsory engagements could not be considered binding, but that it was meritorious to break such as were made with infidels.

[^9]: After the taking of Jerusalem, the crown was offered to Godfrey of Bouillon; but that pious leader declined it, saying, “that he would never wear a crown of gold in the place where his Saviour had worn a crown of thorns.” The title of First King of Jerusalem, which he bears in history, was bestowed on him by his comrades, but, I believe, never assumed by himself.
