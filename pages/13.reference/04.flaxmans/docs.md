Saturday Oct. 24, 1812 

I yesterday spent a very pleasant evening at Mr Flaxmans, the company present were, Mr. Mrs. and Miss Flaxman, 2 Miss Denmans, Mr. T. Denman, Mrs. and Miss Vardill, Governor Franklin, My Mother and myself.

After supper Dr Johnson, and his propensity to Superstition were named, when My Mother said she had always considered it as the most amicable part of his character, in which Mr. Flaxman agreed. This, and some remarks on Dr. Johnson’s great disposition to believe in the Second Sight, led to a good deal of conversation, in the course of which the following curious circumstances were related, which were not, like the usual tales of Ghosts and Hobgoblins, of figures stalking by moonlight, over some favourite spot of ground, dreaded and believed by all, yet actually seen by none, or only by those whose testimony is very doubtful. The Second Sight, and the idea of the spirits of the dead being sometimes permitted to revisit this world, to give some important warning to their friends &c, have of late been the subjects of much discussion, and many in disgust or ridicule of the credulous, have fallen into the opposite extreme of scepticism. In this instance, as in almost every other, the golden mean is perhaps to be preferred. Should this little paper by any accident ever fall into the hands of one of these sceptics, I may perhaps like others be ridiculed for my credulity, but I have certainly been much more frequently censured for the opposite error. A few months since Miss Baillie’s fine <cite>Tragedy of Orra</cite> came into consideration, and in the course of some remarks which took place respecting it, my sister strongly reprehended me for my incredulity in these matters. In the vulgar idea of Ghosts which return to this world to give information of some concealed treasure, or for some other purpose equally frivolous, which however it might have interested the living, can, whether they are blessed or otherwise, no longer deserve a thought, I have no belief. But that Spirits have occasionally given a friend notice of their death or of his own, have attested the truth of our belief in another world and summoned him to prepare for it, there are many well attested instances, and perhaps some of the following may not be thought unworthy of notice.

Of the existence of Prophecy no one who believes in the religion of our Saviour can possibly doubt, and it is certainly not improbable that a portion of this divine spirit, though comparatively exceedingly small may sometimes have been imparted to many who have hence possessed what has received the name of Second Sight. It has been observed, and with a considerable degree of apparent weight, that this gift has not been imparted to persons eminent, either for piety or for intellectual energy, but for the most part to the rude and ignorant. Shall I then go farther and say, that possibly the faculty of prescience may to a certain degree be implanted in every mind, but that those, which refinement has stored with a multiplicity of ideas, are less alive to its suggestions, or should they feel them, reason them away. Should some unseen influence impress them with the idea of a future event, and that event take place, they might have had *some reason* to expect it. Should they fancy they see a friend, and afterwards hear that he was either dead or distant at the moment, they would say it had been someone like him that they had seen. The ignorant man on the contrary having but few ideas, is more open to these impressions of futurity, and more likely to remember them. I know that some few years ago, I have had unaccountable anticipations of events that I had not the slightest reason to expect, which afterwards took place, and which though trifling in themselves were *then* of great importance to me, and imprinted themselves deeply on my memory. But should those same events now take place, with the same anticipation, I should probably refer them to some unperceived association of ideas, some invisible connection, like that which upon recollection and reflection we often perceive to have subsisted between our dreams and the actions and conversations of the preceding day. Be all this as it may, I will conclude with an observation made last night, that it is better to be too credulous than otherwise, and that it is not wise to overthrow anything that reminds us of the other world or that establishes a connection between it and the present, at the same time that we ought not to be in constant expectation of visions, or supernatural visitations.

This is dangerous ground and it is perhaps presumption in me to venture upon it. If so, I entreat pardon from above, and indulgence from my readers, should there ever be any.
