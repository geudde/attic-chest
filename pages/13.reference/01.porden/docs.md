## or<br>The Triumph of Constancy

Of Earth and Air I sing, of Sea and Fire,<br>
And various wonders that to each belong,<br>
And while to stubborn themes I tune the lyre,<br>
“Fierce wars and faithful loves shall moralize my song.”

A young lady, one of the members of a small society which meets periodically for literary amusement, lost her Veil (by a gust of wind) as she was gathering shells on the coast of Norfolk. This incident gave rise to the following Poem, which was originally written in short cantos, and afterwards extended and modelled into the form in which it is now respectfully submitted to the public. The author, who considers herself a pupil of the Royal Institution, being at that time attending the Lectures given in Albemarle-Street, on Chemistry, Geology, Natural History, and Botany, by Sir Humphry Davy, Mr. Brand, Dr. Roget, Sir James Edward Smith, and other eminent men, she was induced to combine these subjects with her story; and though her knowledge of them was in a great measure orally acquired, and therefore cannot pretend to be extensive or profound, yet, as it was derived from the best teachers, she hopes it will seldom be found incorrect.

The machinery is founded on the Rosicrusian doctrine, which peoples each of the four elements with a peculiar class of spirits, a system introduced into poetry by Pope, and since used by Darwin, in the Botanic Garden; but the author believes that the ideal beings of these two distinguished writers will not be found to differ more from each other, than from those called into action in the ensuing Poem. She has there endeavoured to shew them as representing the different energies of nature, exerted in producing the various changes that take place in the physical world; but the plan of her Poem did not permit her to exhibit them to any considerable extent. On the Rosicrusian mythology, a system of poetical machinery might be constructed of the highest character; but the person who directs its operations should possess the scientific knowledge of Sir Humphry Davy, and the energy and imagination of Lord Byron and Mr. Scott.

In personifying the metals and minerals, and the agency of fire, the author has generally taken her names from the Greek language; but as it was impossible to avoid the nomenclature of modern chemistry, she requests, on the plea of necessity, the indulgence of her readers for what she fears will be felt as a barbarous mixture.

## Book the First


## The Castle

The summer sun its setting radiance shed,<br>
And tinged the eastern clouds with rosy red;<br>
While from the west, a flood of amber light<br>
Stream’d thro’ the foliage on the dazzled sight: <br>
As in a forest’s wildering mazes straytd <br>
A youthful warrior and a blooming maid.<br>

The Maid was fair, as Poets bent on praise<br>
Have often painted in their flattering lays,<br>
When they from Fancy, not from Nature, drew<br>
Their finished forms, yet still to Nature true.<br>
Erewhile her eyes’ soft lustre did outshine<br>
The brightest diamonds of Golconda’s mine;<br>
But grief had now their native fire deprest;<br>
And frequent sighs burst from her anguished breast.<br>
No guardian veil concealed her charms, but round<br>
Her jetty locks, a wreath of flowers was bound;<br>
Her vesture rivalled the unsullied snow,<br>
A sable scarf declared her inward woe.

The Knight, in prime of youthful vigour, joined<br>
Undaunted courage, and a courteous mind;<br>
Black were his arms — the painting on his shield<br>
The strange occasion of their grief revealed:<br>
Lo! on the foamy ocean’s shingly sands,<br>
Reft of her Veil, a weeping damsel stands,<br>
Beside a yawning gulf a Gnome appears,<br>
Who waves the ravished veil and mocks her tears;<br>
While forms ethereal lightly float in air,<br>
And weep in pity o’er the injured fair.<br>
An azure marge the pictured forms enroll’d,<br>
Where shine these haughty words embost in gold:<br>
*Proud Gnome, the veil to me, thy rival, yield,<br>
Or dare my vengeance in the listed field.

Warned by approaching night, with slackened rein<br>
They urge their steeds some friendly roof to gain,<br>
At length they reached the confines of the wood<br>
Where, on a hill, an ancient Castle stood;<br>
With high embattled towers, and turrets crown’d,<br>
By massy walls enclosed, and moated round.<br>
Cheered at the sight, they checked each weary horse,<br>
And to the drawbridge bent their joyful course,<br>
When as the warder from the walls espied<br>
The pair advancing, to the Knight he cried,<br>
“A friend or foe?” — “A friend!” the Knight replied:<br>
“We crave a shelter till returning day<br>
Shall lend its light to speed us on our way.”<br>
“Then welcome,” he rejoined; “but, Warrior, pause,<br>
And, ere you enter, learn the Castle’s laws,<br>
And swear obedience — nor misdeem we claim<br>
A pledge injurious to your knightly fame:<br>
With Royal Edward, from their country far,<br>
Through France our warriors spread the flames of war,<br>
And few remain, though many a danger calls<br>
For all our care, to guard our threatened walls;<br>
Hence we require, that when, with strength restored<br>
By food and wine, you quit the festive board,<br>
That from the bridge descending to the plain,<br>
You, till the morn, in arms our watch maintain;<br>
While we retire, with lengthened toil opprest,<br>
Meanwhile the damsel in our walls shall find<br>
From foes protection, and a welcome kind.<br>
In arms like yours, with each a beauteous dame,<br>
Two knights this evening to the Castle came.<br>
The knights with thee till morn the watch will share,<br>
The maids with thine partake the Baron’s care.”

Brave Henry to the proffered terms agreed,<br>
Then o’er the drawbridge guides Maria’s steed;<br>
The warder there admits the Knight and Maid,<br>
And through a court of Gothic grandeur led;<br>
His Lord received them in a spacious hall,<br>
Where martial trophies decked the storied wall,<br>
And many a pictured pannel seemed to trace<br>
The ancient glories of a noble race.<br>
On couches there two wearied maids repose,<br>
Who now to meet the lovely stranger rose,<br>
While with that courtesy which marks the brave,<br>
Two youths to Henry cordial greeting gave.

Fair was each damsel, but the fairest far<br>
Maria seemed, like evening’s dewy star,<br>
When all the rival fires that grace the night<br>
By their own splendour prove her richer light:<br>
As far in speech, in mien, and courteous mind,<br>
Brave Henry left his young compeers behind.<br>
Soon to a banquet, where, with costly pride,<br>
Carinthia’s[^1] ores the massy bowl supplied,<br>
Where Gallia’s grapes their richest nectar poured,<br>
And tropic dainties piled the groaning board,<br>
The Baron leads, and tries, with social arts,<br>
To soothe the anguish of their aching hearts;<br>
Cheats the dull hour with many a sportive jest,<br>
And gaily urges the neglected feast,<br>
Till sorrow slept, and joy from every eye<br>
Beamed like the sunshine through a wat’ry sky.<br>

[^1]: Carinthia, a duchy of Austria, formerly celebrated for its mines of gold and silver, &amp;c.

With food refresh’d, his helm with sable plumes,<br>
His lance and shield, each warrior now resumes,<br>
And by the warder summoned took his way,<br>
Before the bridge to watch till dawn of day.<br>
Meanwhile the Baron with surprize surveyed,<br>
In garb resembling, every knight and maid,<br>
Save that, amid her glossy ringlets twined,<br>
A wreath of flowers Maria’s locks confined.<br>
“And why,” he said, “fair ladies, do you shew<br>
By dress a seeming fellowship in woe?—<br>
What wrongs have forced you from your peaceful home,<br>
And why, unveiled, to distant lands you roam,<br>
Why comes each knight, in sable arms arrayed,<br>
Why on each helm are sable plumes displayed,<br>
Fain would I learn: — tho’ memory oft may bring<br>
The cup of sorrow bitterest from the spring,<br>
Yet pitying friendship to the woe worn heart<br>
Repays the pangs remembered griefs impart:<br>
And if your cause should martial aid require,<br>
Though stiff my limbs, and quenched my youthful fire,<br>
This arm, which erst in many a well-fought day<br>
Through Paynim hosts to victory led the way,<br>
May yet have strength the sword and lance to wield,<br>
And aid your chosen champions in the field.”<br>
To all he spoke, but most Maria prest,<br>
Who sighing, thus the listening group addrest.

“Oh that the tale I tell had power to charm<br>
Your grief, and anguish of its stings disarm,<br>
To speed the hours on pinions of delight,<br>
Till day should rise, unlooked for, on the night!<br>
But one rash promise that has sealed my doom<br>
Will o’er my story cast a mournful gloom.<br>
Erewhile two youths of differing tempers strove<br>
With rival ardour to obtain my love,<br>
One, dark and gloomy, as the bursting storm,<br>
When lowering clouds autumnal skies deform;<br>
The other, as the vernal morning gay,<br>
When rosy Phoebus woos the sprightly May.

“This on his boundless riches loved to dwell,<br>
Which might Arabia’s fabled hoards excell;<br>
Strove to allure my heart with splendid tales<br>
Of diamond palaces, and emerald vales,<br>
Of amber streams o’er sapphire beds that rolled,<br>
And silver seas, and lakes of liquid gold;<br>
Described his destined consort’s regal state,<br>
What slaves in gorgeous robes should round her wait<br>
In halls where luxury all her pomp displays,<br>
And fragrant gums in golden censers blaze;<br>
From harps unseen while heavenly music flows<br>
To cheer the feast, or soothe to soft repose;<br>
And every lure to fix my fancy tried<br>
That flatters female vanity and pride;<br>
But still his gloomy scowl, his eye of fire,<br>
Was on his rival bent with jealous ire,<br>
His proud demeanour chilled my soul with dread,<br>
And mystery enveloped all he said.

“The other, nor on wealth nor state relied,<br>
But love alone his eloquence supplied,<br>
His manly mind disdained insidious art,<br>
And scorned by flattery to ensnare my heart.<br>
Not long in vain my gentle suitor strove,<br>
But still my breast concealed its infant love:<br>
Tho’ skill’d and proved in every manly art,<br>
He struck the ring or hurl’d the unerring dart,<br>
Beyond his peers the ponderous bar he threw,<br>
And bent with surer aim the stubborn yew;<br>
I seem’d to scorn the tourney’s harmless wreath,<br>
And bad him seek the nobler fields of death;<br>
To bear the Cross in Salem’s hallow’d laud,<br>
Or join our sable Edward’s conquering band;<br>
Hence with that hero he resolved to sail,<br>
Whose freighted ships then watched a favouring gale.

“To me one morn, one fatal morn, he came,<br>
But nor in manner, speech, or look the same;<br>
Gone was that cheerful smile, that graceful ease,<br>
That gentle warmth that marks the wish to please,<br>
The sportive wit, the fire of hope and joy,<br>
That still with me illumed my Henry’s eye;<br>
A sullen sorrow now his looks declare,<br>
And his hoarse voice rang strangely in mine ear;<br>
I started — ‘Does Maria then,’ he said,<br>
‘Grieve at the change her cruelty has made?<br>
Thou bidst me leave thy presence, bidst me shine<br>
In glory’s favour, ere I hope for thine;<br>
Farewell — I sail to Gallia’s hostile shore,<br>
Return victorious, or return no more;<br>
But oh, from thee removed, whose sight inspired<br>
My breast with love, with virtue, valour fired,<br>
What to my arms, can like thy smile supply<br>
Art to repel, or vigour to annoy?<br>
Yet grant some pledge, no happier youth shall gain<br>
That envied hand, so long desired in vain;<br>
This in the fight shall steel thy warrior’s breast,<br>
And soothe his slumbers in the hour of rest.’”

“’Tis said that ‘often in the parting hour’<br>
Victorious love asserts superior power,<br>
I proved it true, when by his prayers subdued,<br>
These words I spoke, — yet half in jesting mood—<br>
“Go, Henry, go! be Heaven in fight your shield,<br>
Your guide to glory thro’ the ensanguined field,<br>
And unperceived if you this Veil obtain,<br>
When with the year the hour returns again,<br>
I plight my faith, with honour’s laurel twined,<br>
Love’s myrtle crown my warrior’s brows shall bind.”

“The youth I marked, and while I gaily spoke,<br>
On his pale face the glow of triumph broke,<br>
But not my Henry’s sunny smile; it shew’d<br>
Like lightning gleaming on a lurid cloud,<br>
And o’er my darkened mind appeared to throw<br>
The sad presentiment of future woe,—<br>
Then fancy trac’d the battle’s bloody plain,<br>
The shock of arms, the dying and the slain,<br>
Pale on the ground my wounded lover laid,<br>
The fatal sword uplifted o’er his head<br>
Shuddering I bade him stay — the youth was fled.

“But Henry soon returned. He bore a wreath,<br>
From whose rich flowers no common odours breathe;<br>
Their wonted fire again his eyes illumed,<br>
And on his cheeks their native roses bloomed;<br>
‘This wreath,’ he said, ‘while constant I remain,<br>
By time uninjured, shall its hues retain;<br>
But should I fall by fate’s severe decree,<br>
Or prove unfaithful to my vows and thee,<br>
Those vows that here repeated make me thine,<br>
These flowers their bloom and fragrance shall resign:’<br>
He placed it on my head — he sigh’d adieu,<br>
Just prest my trembling hand, and then withdrew.<br>
The precious wreath, preserved with faithful care,<br>
I since have worn, and still uninjured wear.

“Some months elapsed. At length the tidings came<br>
Of Poictiers glorious field, and Edward’s fame;[^2]<br>
Can nobler deeds the daring bard engage?<br>
Or brighter virtues grace a future age?<br>

[^2]: From the commencement of English history, there is no prince, except Alfred, on whose character and exploits the memory dwells with so much fondness, as on those of the sable Edward. The valour and prudence which won the battles of Crecy and Poictiers, two of the most celebrated in our annals, lose their praise in admiration of the moderation and humanity of the youthful hero, even in the moment of victory.

There prudence aim'd, and mercy staid the sword,<br>
While vanquished Gallia mourn'd her captive lord,<br>
Who now received the honours long denied<br>
To all his pomp of power and regal pride;[^3]<br>
The veterans that his Sire to victory led,<br>
At the glad tidings rais'd the hoary head,<br>
Blest their brave Prince, and half in envy told<br>
Their sons had fought — as they had fought of old —<br>
Where all were heroes, where impatient fame<br>
Could scarce prefer, and scarce reject a name,<br>
Where acts, which else in her bright page had shone,<br>
Past in the blaze of light, unmark'd, unknown;<br>
Elate I heard of deeds by Henry wrought;<br>
How with his Prince the hottest fight he sought,<br>
Once saved the youthful chief and still victorious fought;<br>
I long'd from Henry's lips his deeds to hear,<br>
Nor thought how soon my joy would melt in air.

[^3]: “Edward ordered a repast to be prepared in his tent for the prisoner, (King John,) and lie himself served at the royal captive’s table, as if he had been one of his retinue. He stood at the King’s back during the meal, con- stantly refused to take a place at table, and declared that, being a subject, he was too well acquainted with the distance between his own rank and that of majesty to assume such freedom. All his father’s pretensions to the crown of France were now buried in oblivion: John, in captivity, received the honours of a king, which were refused him when seated ou the throne: his misfortunes not his title were respected.” — *Hume*.

“One vernal morn, (’twas in the month of May,)<br>
As on the ocean’s side I chanced to stray,<br>
My wondering eyes a thousand stones behold,<br>
A thousand shells that shone like gems and gold,<br>
Not with more colours glow’d the <i>pretious shore</i><br>
To whose bright sand submissive ocean bore<br>
The riches of the shipwreck’d seamen’s store,<br>
When Nereus, urged by dark-browed Cymöent, gave<br>
To Marinell the treasures of the wave.[^4]

“No snare suspecting, by their beauty caught,<br>
With eager eye the stones and shells I sought,<br>
When lo! an earthquake seemed to rock the ground,<br>
I started back, and trembling look’d around;<br>
Beneath my feet a hollow noise I heard,<br>
And high the waves their foamy summits reared.<br>
My flying steps some magic influence staid,<br>
And opening earth a hideous gulf displayed;<br>
Mid clouds of smoke, and flames of livid blue,<br>
A giant form rose slowly to my view.<br>
The fatal veil which late my locks confined,<br>
That veil so closely with my fate combined,<br>

[^4]: Spenser's Faery Queene, Book III. Canto IV.

He with insulting transport wav’d in air;<br>
His gloomy looks my Henry’s foe declare,<br>
Though now in robes of regal state he shone,-<br>
And his dark forehead bore a sparkling crown.

“‘In me,’ he said, ‘behold the King, whose sway<br>
Thro’ earth’s unnumber’d caves the Gnomes obey;<br>
Lord of the mine, I own its secret stores,<br>
Its gems, its marbles, and its mineral ores.<br>
Long in a human shape concealed, to gain<br>
Thy love I sought, but only met disdain,<br>
At length my rival’s form I bore, and found,<br>
Beyond my warmest hope my wishes crown’d:<br>
The veil behold — no more I seek to move<br>
Thy stubborn heart; I claim thy promised love.

“‘I wonder not those tears of anguish flow,<br>
That o’er my transports cast a shade of woe,<br>
’Tis woman’s pride, if we her boast believe,<br>
Ne’er to be duped, but ever to deceive;<br>
Yet sages say, tho’ keen a woman’s eyes<br>
To read the heart and pierce the deep disguise,<br>
If Flattery spread her viewless veil between,<br>
Full in her pathway yawns the gulf unseen,<br>
And here she triumphs, where the prayers of love,<br>
And wealth and power have vainly tried to move.

“‘Yet why afflicted thus, why thus disdain<br>
The hand a thousand beauties seek in vain?<br>
In vain each lovely Gnome with studious care<br>
Folds her rich robe, or braids her scented hair,<br>
Or, rifling; all the secrets of the mine,<br>
Makes her dark eye with softer lustre shine,[^5]<br>
I fly their sight and live alone in thine;<br>
Thy form more lovely in its plain attire,<br>
Thine eyes more brilliant in their native fire;<br>
My heart is thine, fair ingrate, thine alone;<br>
O! dry those tears and share a monarch’s throne.<br>
What though thou quit the sun’s enlivening ray,<br>
And “the warm precincts of the cheerful day,”<br>
The feathered songsters, fruits and fragrant flowers,<br>
And dear companions of thy social hours,<br>
Yet deem not my extended realms below,<br>
The constant haunt of horror, gloom, and woe,<br>

[^5]: A variety of metallic preparations have been used by the ladies of different countries for this purpose, particularly the oxyds of bismuth and antimony. Among the Medes it was not confined to the fair sex; at least Xenophon, in his Cyroptedia, describes Astyages as having his eyes painted. The custom still prevails in the Levant.

The light of Heaven our quenchless lamps supply,<br>
Our vaults re-echo to the sounds of joy,<br>
To festive songs my Gnomes attune the lyre,<br>
And captive Sylphs the dulcet flute inspire;<br>
To grace my court assembled thousands shine,<br>
Approved in valour, or of charms divine;<br>
Those fading flowers no more shall bind thy brow,<br>
But in their stead a diamond circlet glow;<br>
Art’s magic-hand, at thy command shall spread,<br>
With gems in flowery guise, the emerald mead,<br>
Bid vales descend, or lofty hills arise,<br>
And mimic suns adorn the sapphire skies.<br>
Farewell — the cares of empire bid me flee,<br>
Those cares neglected in pursuit of thee,<br>
Fain would I stay, those streaming tears to dry,<br>
And gaze enraptur’d on that speaking eye,<br>
But duty calls — yet till the tedious sun<br>
His lingering course thro’ twelve long signs shall run,<br>
And shine propitious on our nuptial hour,<br>
For thee my Gnomes shall deck the regal bower.’”

“He spoke and vanished. Still in mute amaze<br>
On vacant air I fixed my earnest gaze,<br>
Still in my ear his hated accents rung,<br>
Fear fixed me to the spot, and chained my tongue;<br>
Above his head the yawning earth had closed,<br>
Sunk was the wind, the waves in peace reposed;<br>
Surpassing Nature’s law, the past might seem<br>
But the vain horrors of a dreadful dream,<br>
Yet my stol’n veil a proof too certain bore;<br>
Grief clog’d the hours that hope had wing’d before,<br>
And murmur’d still of fairy visions crost,<br>
And love and happiness and freedom lost;<br>
How oft I watch’d, impatient for the light,<br>
Then loath’d the morn, and wish’d again for night;<br>
Or wept to find those hours had passed away,<br>
And nearer brought the inevitable day!<br>
’Till once, as Phoebus ting’d the eastern skies,<br>
Soft slumber stole upon mine aching eyes,<br>
When on my view a form ethereal broke,<br>
That hovering o’er me, thus melodious spoke:

‘No more, sweet maid, let grief your peace destroy,<br>
But cherish hope, for hope shall lead to joy;<br>
That Power Eternal, whose creative mind<br>
This orb, and all yon wandering spheres design’d;<br>
From nothing call’d yon source of life and light,<br>
And all the starry splendours of the night;<br>
To numerous spirits, in that awful hour,<br>
Their portions gave of delegated power:<br>
Four tribes who rule this orb with equal sway,<br>
The Earth, the Fire, the Winds, and Waves obey;<br>
In fire the Salamanders hold their reign,<br>
The bold Hydidae curb the azure main,<br>
The Gnomes are guardians of the solid land,<br>
And Sylphs the impassive realms of air command;<br>
These jarring tribes in endless strife engage,<br>
Foil and are foiled, with ineffectual rage;<br>
Their mutual war their balanced reign secures,<br>
And endless order ceaseless strife ensures.

‘In that sad morn thou soughtst on ocean’s strand<br>
The gems the Gnome had strew’d with treacherous hand,<br>
O’er the green wave unnumber’d Sylphids play’d,<br>
That all thy motions with delight survey’d,<br>
And fill’d with warm desire to view unveil’d<br>
The charms thy maiden modesty conceal’d,<br>
They flutter’ d round in many a lucid ring,<br>
Stretch’d the light hand, and waved the filmy wing,<br>
And strove, with gentle violence, to raise<br>
The silken screen, that mock’d their eager gaze;<br>
When lo! a viewless hand the veil unbound,<br>
And rudely plung’d it in the deep profound,<br>
Then shook the earth, and in a yawning void,<br>
Albruno rose, in all his kingly pride:<br>
The rest thou know’st — the Sylphs thy lot deplore,<br>
Dissolve in tears, and quit the fatal shore.

‘Incens’d, the Gnome by fraud and theft should dare<br>
Pollute my realms, I roused the powers of air,<br>
In hope by prompt exertion to regain<br>
The ravish’d pledge; but all our toils were vain:<br>
For base Albruno had his prize immur’d<br>
In deepest caverns, and with spells secur’d:<br>
But now the day approaches; gentle maid,<br>
Arouse thee from thy trance of grief, and aid<br>
Our high emprize, to free thee from thy vow,<br>
The sole resource thy stubborn fates allow.

‘Long had a war, with rancorous hatred waged,<br>
The sullen Gnomes and Sprites of Fire engaged,<br>
’Till wearied all, a transient peace confined<br>
Each martial hand, but fettered not the mind,<br>
The Sprites, of rest impatient, every one<br>
Loth to begin, yet wished the war begun;<br>
The flame to kindle, to the Prince of Fire<br>
A Sylph I sent, who roused the monarch’s ire;<br>
Against the Gnomes he leads his hostile line,<br>
And soon with him will Ocean’s sovereign join;<br>
These powers at once their double war shall wage,<br>
And from his bride Albruno’s thoughts engage;<br>
’Tis thine to aid us — seek the gloomy mine,<br>
There urge thy suit, and tears and prayers combine;<br>
For there alone must fraud or force assail,<br>
Tho’ vain were force, such spells secure the Veil,<br>
And tho’ our strength should burst the powerful chains,<br>
A stronger tye, thy plighted faith, remains.<br>
His hand alone, his breast should mercy warm,<br>
Thy pledge resigning, can dissolve the charm,<br>
But if, observant of the stated hour,<br>
He come to bear thee to his bridal bower,<br>
We can but mourn, — to save exceeds our power.<br>
Where’er thou art, his mightier charms compel<br>
Their weeping slave to earth’s remotest cell;<br>
But should he fail, by fraud or force delayed,<br>
’Till night descending wrap this land in shade;<br>
Vain are his hopes, for in an adverse course<br>
His spells rebounding with elastic force<br>
Unlock the casket they secur’d before,<br>
And the lost Veil compel him to restore;<br>
Then cling to Hope, best solace of our pain,<br>
Herself a blessing, if her dreams be vain;<br>
Nor dread the perils of the lonely road,<br>
Or the dark horrors of his drear abode,<br>
My watchful care thy safety shall provide,<br>
Thy guard in danger, as in doubt thy guide.’”

“He vanished: but that voice so sweet, so clear,<br>
Yet thrilled with transport my delighted ear,<br>
I rose, and still a cloud of rich perfume,<br>
Shook from his wings, was floating in the room,<br>
And at my gate, a milk white palfry stood,<br>
With costly trappings harnessed for the road;<br>
I mounted, and discarding female fear,<br>
Placed my firm confidence in Ariel’s care.<br>
All day I journey’d, but as evening fell,<br>
Trembling I wander’d thro’ a woody dell;<br>
No sound of life reliev’d my anxious ear,<br>
I look’d in vain, no sheltering roof was near,<br>
When lo! amid a blaze of golden light,<br>
A rich pavilion rose upon my sight,<br>
I enter’d, by some unknown influence led,<br>
By hands unseen the plenteous board was spread,<br>
Prepared by hands unseen the downy bed.

“With speed untir’d, thro’ many a lengthen’d day,<br>
My horse instinctive still pursu’d his way;<br>
And still as round the shades of evening close,<br>
In lonely wilds the rich pavilion rose,<br>
Or in some rural cot I found repose;<br>
’Till on this morn, in sable arms I view’d<br>
An unknown warrior, who my steps pursu’d,<br>
’Twas Henry, late from conquer’d Gallia come,<br>
By Ariel warn’d, to guide me to the Gnome;<br>
Together thro’ the wood our course we steer,<br>
And bless the fate that stay’d our wanderings here,<br>
Where generous welcome cheers the weary guest,<br>
And kindness soothes the aching heart to rest;<br>
We hope, ere sinks to-morrow’s sun, to gain<br>
The rocky margin of the northern main;<br>
For Sweden thence we sail, where mountains round<br>
Stretch their long chains, with snows eternal crown’d,<br>

Long, dark and dreary, to the Gnome’s abode.”

Imprudent maid! thy heedless lips exposed<br>
The secret plans to thee alone disclosed,<br>
Thy councils known, the host, whose cheerful smile<br>
Veil’d the dark agent of Albruno’s guile,<br>
Rejoic’d in secret, while his feign’d surprize,<br>
And falser pity, blind thy heedless eyes;<br>
Yet scarce his art the latent joy represt,<br>
Scarce on thy woes forbore the bitter jest,<br>
As oft he urged Miranda to unfold,<br>
Why o’er her vest the scarf of sable roll’d,<br>
And head unveil’d, some inward sorrow told.<br>
Fair was the maid, her eyes of softest blue,<br>
Her floating tresses bore an amber hue,<br>
Of height majestic, dignity and grace<br>
Spoke in her actions, mingled in her face,<br>
All present view’d her with attentive look,<br>
By soft attraction bound, while thus she spoke:

“Lost in amazement, if mine eyes betray’d<br>
No common pity for yon injur’d maid,<br>
At once I mourned her sufferings and my own,<br>
Nor grieved nor wonder’d at her fate alone,<br>
Like her’s my vesture, and like her’s my tale —<br>
A royal suitor, and a ravish’d Veil.

The hyacinth, the violet’s purple dye,<br>
Aud myosotis blue, with golden eye,<br>
Which oft the German youth, in graceful knot,<br>
Bears to his love, and sighs ‘Forget me not.’[^7]<br>
At length diverging, Nature’s course we trace,<br>
From the first embryo, till the plant decays;<br>
How from the germ the leafy stems ascend,<br>
And deep in earth the fibrous roots extend;<br>
How leaves would issue from the inverted root,<br>
And the green stems in rigid fibres shoot;[^8]<br>
How from pure water, given the powers to share,<br>
Of vivifying heat, and light, and air,<br>
The leaves their vivid green, the flowers assume<br>
Their balmy fragrance, and their various bloom;<br>

[^7]: The myosotis, or scorpion grass, is a beautiful plant which grows abundantly by the side of running waters. It has a small blue flower, with agolden eye in the centre, and is a great favourite with the Germans, who call it *“Forget me not*.” These flowers, or their enamelled resemblance, are frequently interchanged as tokens of regard. The *“Forget me not”* of the Germans is by some believed to be the veronica chamaedrys, which is also a beautiful blue flower.

[^8]: If a plant be taken out of the ground and inverted, its parts also invert their functions. What was formerly the root becomes green, and leaves and flowers shoot out in the place of fibres. The inverted stem on the contrary grows rigid, and soon assumes the appearance and the functions of the root. — *Lectures delivered at the Royal Institution, by Dr. now Sir James Edward Smith*.

Its precious gum mimosa plenteous pours,<br>
The camphor tree secretes its spicy stores;*
How the same soils, in equal luxury, feed

The plant medicinal, and poisonous weed;

How he, though cast upon some unknown shore,

Could tell the noxious and nutritious flower;f

How in the tulip's bulb the flower is found,

And future leaves their embryo charge surround; J

How, grafted on its stock, the crab will bear

The sweeter apple or the juicy pear,

But gradual as the parent grafts decay,

The sympathetic offspring fades away.§

* The principal, if not the only food of plants, appears to be water, from
which, when exposed to the aclion of the solar light, all their various secre-
tions are produced. The beautiful green of the leaves, the vivid tints of the
flower, their fragrance, the flavour of the fruit, with their endless variety in
the different species, all seem to be derived from one source; and plants,
whose properties and secretions are the most different, grow in equal luxuri-
ance side by side. — Smith's Lectures.

t The tetradynamia, or plants with cruciform flowers, are all, when boiled,
wholesome and nutritious. There is also a more extended criterion. The
fruits of flowers having the stamina inserted into the calyx may be eaten
with safety, and are generally agreeable, but flowers having the stamina
inserted into the receptacle are always to be suspected. — .Smith's Lectures.

t If the bulb of the tulip be opened, the rudiments of the future leaves
and even the embryo of the flower may be seen. — Smith's Lectures.

§ The decay of our apples has excited much apprehension. Some of the
finest kinds are nearly extinct, and others have evidently degenerated.
Many attempts have been made to supply this loss by grafting favourite
apples upon young stocks, but in vain. This has proved to be only the




" The paths of science while I thus pursued,
A strange event disturbed the peaceful flood;
No more like liquid glass the waters seem,
But dire commotions vex the troubled stream;
On rushed the impetuous tide, with thundering roar,
And wave o'er wave the foaming waters pour,
Drive back the refluent stream, which widely spread,
And rising high, o'erflowed its oozy bed;
The fishers, who the coming ill descried,
With speed for safety sought the middle tide,*
When in the stream a monster rose, whose sight
Had filled the boldest bosom with affright;
His hideous form was rough with many a scale,
Green was his hair, his hand displayed my Veil;



extension of an individual, not the production of a new one, and as the
parent tree decayed, the grafts decayed also. To prevent the loss of so
valuable a fruit, Mr. Knight sowed a quantity of the seeds of our best apples,
in hope that, although a great majority would be merely crabs, out of many
thousands he might procure a few valuable apples. His efforts have not
been unsuccessful, and many of the new varieties promise to vie, in size and
flavour, with the finest of the old ones. — Smith's Lectures.

* This passage is intended as a slight description of the phenomenon called
the Bore or Agar, occasioned by the sudden influx of the tide into a river.
Those rivers which have a wide embouchure, that becomes suddenly con-
tracted, are most subject to it. The tide rushing up the stream, drives back
the descending water, and the vessels upon it find themselves instantly
raised many feet above their former level. In England the Severn is parti-
cularly subject to the Bore; but it is most remarkable in the Indian rivers,
the principal branches of the Ganges, the Megna, and the Hoogly.




His hoarse rough voice was like the deaf ning roar

Of billows breaking on the rocky shore,

While with rude homage, and uncourtly mien,

He told Marino's tale, and hail'd me as his queen.



" My fate to shun, I ponder'd long in vain,
My frustrate projects but increas'd my pain;
For counsel then I sought an hermit's cave,
The prescient sage this strange injunction gave.
" With Alfred to the ocean's side repair,
" To aid your wish, a pearl shall meet you there,
" Dear to the King, and save you from despair."



" Oh! words obscure! whence hope can scarcely spring,
Yet still to these, our last resource we cling,

In dubious faith the dark behest obey,
And seek the Ocean with returning day;
While on my Alfred's shield our quest is shewn,
And round the Veil inscribed ' For this alone.'"

Miranda ceas'd; each maid attentive heard,
And felt surprize increase at every word,
And while the Baron cheer'd his lovely guest,
He feign'd no more the wonder he exprest;




To Leonora turned, and sought to know

If from a kindred source her sorrows flow. 6

As either maid was Leonora fair —
A silken net confin'd her sable hair;
Tho' less her stature, yet her form so light,
That in the dance she seem'd some airy sprite,
Or of that choir that met in bright array,
" To do observance to the Morn of May,"*
Tript in gay circles round their virgin queen,
And hymn'd the praises of the laurel green.
A warmer sun had tinged her lovely face,
Yet animation lent a sprightly grace;

Nor could Affliction's briny tear destroy
The speaking lustre of her hazel eye;
As with a smile the damsel thus began,
Through all her speech her cheerful temper ran:

" I fear my story of another Veil
Will prove the tedium of a thrice told tale;
Well might Maria, or Miranda, move
Their hearers pity's genuine power to prove,

* See " The Flower and the Leaf."




But when such rivals in the lists appear,

How can / hope a sympathetic tear,

Who, at my onset, must perforce confess

My sorrows lighter, as my beauty less?

" A Spaniard I — my father lov'd to trace,
Thro' many a warlike chief, his noble race
To heroes, who on Ronscesvailes plain ~\

Fought for the freedom of invaded Spain, V

And check'd the arms of conquering Charlemagne: /

In youth he came to Albion's happy land,
There woo'd my mother, and obtain'd her hand,
With her to Spain he plough'd the vvatry way,

Where first mine infant eyes beheld the day.
Oft had the palm of victory graced his arms,
Yet now he shun'd the battle's loud alarms,
And fled the crowded scenes of courtly strife
For the calm pleasures of domestic life.



" From old Cordova's Roman walls expelled,*
Brave Ferdinand the haughty Moors had quelled;

* Cordova, or Corduba as it was anciently called, was founded by the
Romans. It was afterwards in possession of the Goths, and then of the Moors,
who were expelled in 1236 by Ferdinand the Third, who first united the
crowns of Castille and Leon. From this time Cordova, hitherto the seat of
learning, declined, and that star, which had shone amidst darkness and bar-
barism, sunk ere the dawn returned to Europe.




But still from Afric poured the ambitious foes,*

And the new kingdom of Granada rose,

Where luxury held in Hamet's court her reign,

And arts and splendour triumph'd in her train.

Fame, in Castille, Granada's pomp had told;j

Her proud Alhambra with its walls of gold,

Her nobles' wealth and state, their skill in arms,

The matchless lustre of their ladies' charms;

Her hills, where dark the olive woods extend,

And the green boughs with fruits Hesperian bend;

Where the sweet rose, and starry jasmine spring,

And frequent founts their liquid crystal fling;



* Granada was early in the possession of the Moors, but the kingdom was
dissolved in 1221. In 1236, fresh bands pouring over from Africa, Granada
became the seat of opulence and splendour, and the Moorish capital of Spain.
In speaking of Granada, historians and geographers become poetical, and
describe in glowing terms its fertile valley, bounded by mountains, and
watered by the Genii and the Guadalquivir; its hills covered with groves
of orange, of mulberry, and of olive; the magnificence of its palaces, and
the splendour of its court, where the manners of chivalry received a peculiar
colouring from the luxury of Africa. At the time mentioned in the poem,
the sceptre of Granada was held by Jusef Hacen Hamet, the seventh king of
Granada. Those who are fond of romantic history will be gratified by the
translation of the Civil Wars of Granada, by Mr. Iiodd.

t This is an anachronism. The apartment here alluded to was not added
to the Alhambra till the reign of Muley Hascem, the father of Boabdelin,
who lost his crown to Ferdinand and Isabella. The walls had the appearance
of gold, and are supposed to have been a composition of the yolks of eggs,
Muley Hascem also built the celebrated court of Lions,




Her mulberry groves, in whose propitious gloom
The worm industrious winds its silken tomb;
Her fertile vale where two fair rivers flow,
And lofty mountains ever topt with snow.*

" Roused at the sound, with martial ardour fired,
Or by religion's fervent zeal inspired,
Alfonzo rose; while burning for the fight,
Round Sant' Iago's cross, the youth of Spain unite;
To gain- renown, or grasp so rich a prize,
Or win fresh favour in their ladies' eyes,
They rush to arms, and, of success secure,

Rear their proud banners, and defy the Moor.

" From warfare long estranged, again my sire
Felt in his veins the glow of youthful fire;
Again his limbs in shining arms are drest,
And the broad cuirass guards his manly breast.
Little I thought of war's destructive rage,
Who knew it only in the tuneful page;
My fancy still in brightest hues pourtray'd
The splendid scene of hosts for fight array 'd:




The martial trumpet echoing from afar,

And prancing steeds that love the notes of war;

Aloft in air the pennon's silken fold,

The plumage nodding o'er the casques of gold,

The emblazon'd shields, the armour's burnish'd blaze,

And lances glittering in the morning rays:

Seldom I turn'd to trace the alter'd scene,

When evening closes on the empurpled green;

When dim with dust and blood their bright array,

And cold the hearts that panted for the fray;

Yet when my weeping mother urged her lord

To quit his purpose, or as lost deplored,

I join'd her prayers, I shrunk with kindred fears,

And mix'd with her's my unavailing tears;

Fix'd was his mind, with brave Alfonzo's band

At dawn of day to seek Granada's land. —

" 'Twas night, and all around in silence slept, "1

But rest my pillow shunn'd; I rose and crept i&gt;

To my thin lattice, and in silence wept: )

I blest the evening gale's refreshing power,
As on my cheek it dried the bitter shower:

When from the shaded walk my bower beneath,
I heard soft strains of mournful music breathe.




While with a pleasing voice, and faltering tongue,

An amorous youth his plaintive ditty sung.

My conscious memory well the youth betray'd,

Who waked the echoes with this serenade;

His arm was valiant, noble was his birth,

Castile resounded with Alonzo's worth;

Few knights could tilt, or throw the cane so well,*

Few at the ring the gallant youth excell;

Oft had he pierced the bull with fatal wound,

Or held the roaring savage to the ground,

And still whene'er the youthful hero fought,

The fairest maids the glittering barriers sought,

Who view'd with jealous ire, but seeming scorn,

My favourite colours by the warrior worn,f

While knots of flowers, in mystic guise dispos'd,

His secret passion to my sight disclos'd,

And tuned beneath my vine-clad window, long

The light guitar had join'd his nightly song:



* This was a martial game, in which the young nobles fought in squa-
drons, and canes supplied the place of lances. Tilting was usually per-
formed with canes, but at the tournament lances were used.

t It was the custom for the Moorish or Spanish youth to denote their
affection by wearing the favourite colours of their ladies. The language of
flowers is still so well understood by the ladies of Spain, that it might be
dangerous for the uninitiated to present a nosegay.




But on his flowers I cast a careless eye,
Nor ' blest the youth who bade my slumbers fly.'
And twice the moon had rilled her silver round
Since last mine ear had listen'd to the sound.

" Now sunk the strain, and softly I withdrew
The latticed casement that obscured my view,
Clear shone the moon, the convent's spires were seen
Above its spreading groves of dusky green,
While round the terrac'd walk, with every gale,
Unnumber'd flowers their spicy sweets exhale.

Before me, wrapt in sable cloak and hood,
With folded arms, the brave Alonzo stood;
He rais'd his kindling eye, the mantle fell,
And brightly beam'd his mail of burnished steel.

" Oh! bliss unhoped! does Leonora deign
u A favouring ear to sad Alonzo's strain!"
The youth exclaim'd; " this unexpected grace
" Can all thy scorn and all my woes efface;
" And, like the setting sun, whose piercing ray
" Bursts the thick clouds that veil'd him thro' the day,
" Thou com'st to cheer me with a parting view,
" Ere to those charms I bid a long adieu:
d 3




" Nay, turn not thus, nor thus the prayer disdain

" Of him who ne'er may vex thy sight again,

" For with the earliest dawn Alfonzo's band

" Will march to combat in Granada's land;

" Ev'n now his standard floats, his chargers neigh,

" Ev'n now my ready vassals chide my stay;

" Oh should I fall, would one repentant sigh

" Lament my fate — one tear bedew thine eye?

" Farewel, relentless maid; yet, ere we part,

" Say, does some happier youth possess thy heart,

" Or may I hope my truth at length may move

" Thy mind to pity for Alonzo's love?"

" If this," I said, " can give thy bosom rest,
" No love has enter'd Leonora's breast;
" But wouldst thou hope to light the ardent flame,
" This test of truth, and faith unchanged, I claim —
u My father seeks those scenes of deadly strife,
" Oh! guard with filial care his sacred life;

" Shield his brave bosom from the threatening blade,
a And turn the javelin from his hoary head.
" So may my mother, to his arms restored,
" Bless the kind hand that sav'd her honour'd lord,




u So may a daughter's heart thy deeds approve,
" And gratitude illume the torch of love."
I ceas'd: for on the solemn stiluess fell,
Awful and deep, the convent's matin bell:
I wav'd my hand, Alonzo sigh'd ' Farewel.'



" Swift I retired; my father joined the train,

Where with Alfonzo march'd the flower of Spain,
To distant times shall Spanish records tell*
How to their conquering arms Alziras fell,
And how, his pride at Gades rock o'erthrown,
Granada's monarch wore a vassal crown.
But here, with patriot joy, the loyal tear
Shall join to dew Alfonzo's royal bier.
And mine may mingle well, for by his side,
My sire, with many a proud hidalgo, died,
And near him was the brave Alonzo found, 7S0

His manly bosom pierced with many a wound.

" Oppression soon, in Pedro's iron reign,
Check'd the sweet transports of reviving Spain.

* Alfonzo XI. obtained a signal victory over the Moors in 1340, at
which time Alziras was taken, and the kingdom of Granada made tributary.
He was killed in the siege of Gibraltar, which he had lost before, and suc-
ceeded by his son, Peter the Cruel. — Puffendorf.

Bound by affection's golden tie no more,

My mother wished to seek her native shore,

But as Venasquez' rocky chain we crost,

Mid evening's shades, our guide, our way were lost,

And wandering on, as ebbing light decayed,

Farther and farther from the path we strayed;

Our frames, long soften'd in a southern vale,

Shrunk from the keenness of the mountain gale;

The night grew dark; with weary steps and slow \

We wandered o'er the treacherous field of snow, V

And heard the torrent roar unseen below,* J

And from the wood beneath, the frequent howl

Of bears and wolves, that fierce with hunger prowl:

The struggling ray the moon at times bestow'd,

Served but to shew the horrors of the road,

The avalanch impending from on high,

The gulph below, the terrors of the sky;

Shone but on pointed peaks, and ample brows

White with eternal, undissolving snows:



* "La, j'entendois rouler sous mes pieds un torrent qui se frayoit, a
travers les glaces et les neiges, line route invisible, dont il ne sortoit que
cinquante toises plus bas, pour se precipiter du haut d'un escarpement de
rocliers, dans le grand vallon de neige. La position pouvoit devenir dange-
reuse, a la longue; je la quittai bienlot."

Bamond's Observations faites dans les Pyrenees*




Or, on the glacier's polish'd surface, threw

A fairy tint of evanescent blue:

And now the storm began, and long and loud

Roar'd the deep thunder from the bursting cloud,

In sheets of crimson flame the lightnings play'd,

And torrents fell on each defenceless head;

In azure light the fires electric sweep

O'er the swift streams that ran down every steep;

Yet scarce this awful scene a thought could claim,

And scarcely terror rouse our torpid frame;

Careless, we now the raging storm behold,

Each sense was dull, our souls benumb 'd with cold;

To sleep were death; yet on that rugged crest, }

We long'd (such weight our heavy eyes opprest) V

Amid the snow, the storm, to sink to rest; J

When from a cottage, unobserved before,

A light stream'd brightly thro' the opening door:

New feeling ran thro' every frozen vein,

And life and hope appear'd to wake again.

There, o'er a blazing fire, a youth was seen,

Of pleasing aspect, and of sprightly mien,

Our humid robes his care attentive dried,

His ready hand a plenteous meal supplied;




But when the morn her orient blush displayed,
The altered youth our parting steps delayed,
With crimson blaze his floating garments shone,
A purple radiance formed his flamy crown.

" Oh stay," he cried, " behold the Prince of Flame,
" Earth, air, and ocean start at Pyros' name;
" Prompt at my call, to nourish or annoy,
" Being to give, or being to destroy,
" The salamandrine tribes obey my word,
" And wait in radiant phalanx round their lord;
" An hundred blazing mouths, this frozen realm,
" If I command, with floods of flame o'erwhelm,
11 Those icy cliffs in clouds of steam aspire,
" Those rocks of granite sink in liquid fire;
" Such my tremendous power — but fear not thou:
" To beauty's sway a willing slave I bow,
" Nor shall one sprite his arm in fury wave
" To harm that life my care so lately gave:
" Then let thy grateful heart my wishes crown,
" And be my meed to raise thee to my throne."

" My heart the boon of life preserv'd confest,
Nor dared I spurn the mighty king's request;




My Veil, a solemn pledge, he asked and won,

Which binds my faith to him, and him alone;

But to my earnest prayers one year was given,

Ere for his flaming realms I quit the light of heaven.

" To Albion soon we came; and thither brought
By love, our lone retreat Alonzo sought,
Whom lying fame had number'd with the dead,
When wounded by my father's side he laid;
And hard to say, if now his manly breast
More swell'd with open joy, or grief supprest;
With joy to meet his long-lost love again,
Or grief to find his cherish' d hopes were vain:
Nor less my heart with mingled feelings strove,

When honour struggled with awakening love,
That each new day with deeper grief deplored ~\

My hand affianced to the fiery lord, \

And, to Alonzo pledged, my broken word. 3

At length I heard (the monarch's happy bride)
A nymph of fire my destin'd place supply'd;
Yet he my pledge refuses to restore,
And free the hand that- he can claim no more.




" One eve, when all was still, I strove in vain
To bid the fading embers glow again,

When in the midst arose a sudden flame,
And to mine ear these sounds low murmuring came.

" Our gracious queen, Spinthera, bids me bear
" This message straight to Leonora's ear;
" My heart, she says, is partner in thy pain,
" And oft has urg'd thy suit, but urg'd in vain;
" In Stromboli my Pyros holds his court,
" And there must all who seek the king resort;
" Then hither come, and if thy prayers or mine
" Have power to move, the Veil again is thine;
" Nor fear; my voice shall check the rage of heat,
" And guide thee safely to his flaming seat."

" We move obedient. — My Alonzo's shield
Our quest divulges on its argent field;
Before the monarch's throne a maid appears,
Who seems to sue with ineffectual tears;
And near her stands a knight in sable mail,
With brandish'd falchion — ' Justice and the Veil/




" Strange is my story — strange the links that join
My fate with yours, sweet maids, and yours with mine;
Strange thus to meet, where each to each unknown,
Found each sad tale an echo of her own;
Then cheer your hearts, let each derive relief
From that sure source, community of grief,
And trust that Pow'r, which safe thro' every ill
'Till now has guided, and shall guide us still;
Yet it is wondrous we should weep, when more
Our lot would envy, than our woes deplore;
Think of the joy to range through realms unknown.
The robes of regal state — the sparkling crown, 90o' &gt;

And powers superior trembling at our frown; j

Can love's bright star, or friendship's milder ray,
Vie with the splendour wealth and power display?
Come, mourn no more — we lift our heads on high,
Examples great of female constancy,
Resolved in danger's sternest hour to prove
Our dauntless courage and unchanging love."



She ceas'd; the Baron heard with careful ear,
And deeply pondering, still he seem'd to hear:
At length arous'd, he join'd the tribute paid

Of thanks and wonder to the lovelv maid;

And oft a sympathetic hope eKprest,

To veil the mischief brooding at his breast.

Each maiden half her grief resigns, and blends

In cheerful converse with her new found friends;

While still their young affection warmer grew,

Till late to rest the weary group withdrew.

Meanwhile the warriors, in the open field,
Their guard maintained, and each to each revealed
The mystic meaning of his pictured shield,
When from the earth upsprung a stranger knight,
And dar'd Maria's champion to the fight;
His ruby armour shone with fiery blaze,
His emerald helmet cast resplendent rays;
Of one vast diamond formed, his massy shield
Shone like the moon, and lightened all the field;
Less brilliant, though more fatal, those of yore
That valiant Arthur and Ruggiero bore. #

The knight on Henry cast a threat'ning look, ~\

High o'er his head his beamy sword he shook, &gt;

Then stampt infuriate on the ground, and spoke: J

" Rash youth, to me Maria's charms resign,
" Or meet in arms the Monarch of the Mine;
" The bold defiance on thy shield displayed,
" I rise to answer — fight, or yield the maid;
i( Fool, to believe thy mortal frame can stand
" A weapon wielded by Albruno's hand!

" Advance, if still thou dar'st the unequal strife,
" And lose at once thy mistress and thy life."

" Cease thy proud vaunt!" indignant Henry said,
" And from my vengeance guard thy treacherous head."
They met — alike by love and hate impelled,
And one in skill, and one in strength excelled.
Long Henry strove to wound the Gnome in vain,
His ruby arms unhurt the strokes sustain;
As long Albruno with amazement found
The valiant youth still fought without a wound;

Fierce was the fight, till from the donjon tower
The Castle bell announced the midnight hour.

And warned him that the vassals of the state,

By him convened, in solemn council wait;

Mad with delay, and hopeless now to quell

By arms alone a knight who fought so well,

The wily Gnome seemed half compelled to yield,

Next faint, enfeebled, dropt his ponderous shield,

Then feigned a wound, and sunk upon the field.

Bent o'er the king, victorious Henry tried

To draw the weapon from his bleeding side,

When lo! two sinewy arms enwreathed him round, ^

And bore him, struggling, thro' a gulph profound, V

Down to a central cave, and there in fetters bound. j

In this black vault, no ray of cheerful light
Pierced the thick gloom of everlasting night,
Save when the Gnomes, on hasty errand, past,
Their jewelled wreaths a transient brightness cast;
Then so quick flashed the red or azure beam,
It seemed to Henry but the lightning's gleam,

And they (so far from human shape their forms)
Fiends that delight in hurricanes and storms.

Meanwhile, unarmed, the Monarch of the Mines
In all the pride of regal splendour shines:

Those jewels sought by men as rich, and rare,

To deck the vain, the stately, or the fair,

With thousands yet to solar light unknown,

Blazed on his gorgeous vesture and his crown.

He takes his amethystine throne, in state, ^

Round which a thousand vassal sovereigns wait, 60 V

And thus he opens the august debate: )

" Ye chiefs, that o'er this nether realm preside,
" Its powers direct, its various changes guide,
" Discordant elements in peace combine,
" Their forms, proportions, properties define,
" And curb, by rules as fixed, attraction's force,
" As hold the struggling planets in their course,*



* These lines allude to the law of definite proportions, as started by Mr.
Dalton, and farther developed by Professor Davy, and also to the rules of
crystallization as lately defined. The French chemists have asserted that
bodies do not combine in fixed proportions, but in proportion to their relative
quantities; for instance, that carbonate of lime would, according to the rela-
tive quantities of its elements at its formation, contain a greater or less pro-
portion of carbonic acid, or of lime. But the experiments of Davy and others
appear completely to disprove this assertion, and establish Mr. Dalton's
theory. Carbonate of lime is uniformly found to consist of 44 parts of car-
bonic acid and 56 of lime. Nor does a body capriciously combine in different
proportions with different substances.. Whatever may be the definite pro-
portion of the body with which it enters into combination, its own remains
the same; or should it be augmented, the portion added is always either a
multiple or a divisor of the original quantity. Thus oxygen, in all its various
unions, with hydrogen, with nitrogen, or with the metals, preserves its fixed

proportion of 15 parts by weight, and where more is added, the extra por-
tion is always equal either to 7\ or to 15. Thus nitrous oxyde consists of
one proportion or 26 grains of nitrogen united to one proportion, or 15 grains
of oxygen, making together 41, which is the proportion in which nitrous
oxyde again combines with other bodies to make a tertiary compound.
Nitric oxyde consists .of 26 grains of nitrogen, united to two proportions, or 30
grains of oxygen, making together 56. Nitrous acid consists of 26 grains of
nitrogen, united with four proportions, or 60 grains of oxygen, making toge-
ther 86. And nitric acid consists of 26 grains of nitrogen united with five
proportions, or 75 grains of oxygen, mr.kiug together 101 . Thus in all these
combinations the same law is observed.

Nor are the laws of crystallization less denned. A body unexamined may
be known by the form of its crystals, and even where the general shape,
as in different rhomboids, appears the same, the angles are found to differ.
Thus in calcareous spar, from whatever quarter procured, however small 01
however large the crystals, whether whole, as taken from the mine, or broke:
into a number of smaller ones, the form procured is always the rhomboic
and that rhomboid has always the same angle, 105 degrees. Other bodies
have a rhomboidal crystal, but no other rhomboid has the same angle.

Albruno ceased — and Chrysos next arose;
A golden circle wreath'd his reverend brows;
In finest robes of beaten gold he shone
The splendid " Monarch of Peruvia's throne;"
His various talents, and his worth long tried,
His faithful mind and virtue unalloyed,
Had made him long Albruuo's friendship share,
Dear to the sovereign, to the nation dear;
Tho' Oreichalcon now, with flattering art,
Had from the sage estranged the monarch's heart.

In the first ages of man's fleeting race,
When all was social amity and peace,*
Her richest fruits when earth spontaneous gave,
And bade unsown the yellow harvests wave,
Ere wintry storms defaced the lovely land,
Or sunk the streams in summer's arid sand,
When mild the gales, and soft the genial showers,
And spring perpetual led the laughing hours,



* Gold was in all probability the first metal discovered, as it is much more
frequently found native than any of the others, and if so, the age of gold,
the age of silver, &amp;c. have probably derived their names not so much from
any supposed alteration in the state or character of man, as from the disco-
very of the metals whose name they bear. Davy's Lectures.

But, can a traitor taste unbroken rest?
Is peace an inmate of the canker'd breast?

His father Calchos lov'd in early youth*
Fair Calamina with unshaken truth;
The king their union long forbade, and plann'd
To bless his favourite with Solfara's hand. 7
At length his anger rose, to find, that still
Their constancy opposed his royal will:
They shunn'd the gathering storm, to Pyros fled;
He blest their loves; and in his court they staid
Till jealous Chalcos deem'd the monarch ey'd,
With more than pity's gaze, his gentle bride;
(For o'er the lovely exile's form and face,
Her soft dejection shed a dangerous grace;)
And soon as she, with all a mother's joy,
Gave to his father's arms her smiling boy,
He bore her thence, Albruno's grace they crave,
Who rais'd the suppliants, and their flight forgave.



* Brass is an artificial metal, formed by the union of copper and zinc,
which is an operation of some nicety; for if the fire, that is necessary to
unite them, be too long continued, the zinc flies off, and leaves the copper
again pure. This is attempted to be allegovically expressed in the poem.

t Copper is more frequently found united with sulphur than with any

Young Oreichalcon, with insidious art,
Soon work'd his passage to Albruno's heart:
Envious of Chrysos' well earn'd fame, his mind
To rise upon his rival's fall design'd,
And wishes, almost to himself unknown,
In secret pointed to Albruno's throne.

For this, he Pyros sought, with offers fair,
T' ensure his conquest in the approaching war,
For this, so late, the fatal counsel gave, 250

That brought destruction, while it seem'd to save;
And from the king, Albruno's power o'erthrown,
He, as his price, demanded Chrysos' throne.
But Pyros, thro' the flimsy veil descried
All that ambition lurking strove to hide,
And plann'd (distrustful of a traitor's aid)
To crush him with the monarch he betray'd.

Meanwhile Marino, with unwearied haste,
Along the Gnome's neglected frontier past;
Deep in a vale his weary troops retire, 260

Himself advanced to meet the Prince of Fire;

And strange it seem'd to see those hands, that late

Had grasp'd the quivering spear in mortal hate,

Now joined in friendship, while the kings debate

Their plan of war: — Should they their bands unite?

Or lead their armies separate to the fight?

But Fire's brave prince, who saw, with eagle eye,

How ill his subjects brook'd their new ally,

Lest secret discord, lurking in their heart,

Should rouse a flame, would keep the hosts apart: 270

" Soon as the fleeting hours of truce expire,

" Myself," he said, " will lead the bands of fire.

" While on the Gnomes we pour our utmost force,

" Do thou, Marino, with a circling course,

" Fall on their rear, with thine unbroken powers

" Oppress their line, and victory is ours."

He spoke, and parted; swift the hosts prepare
To quit their camps, and urge the deadly war;
But higher thoughts, though to his breast confiu'd,
Ambition wakened in Marino's mind. 280

And now, with speed, the martial bands arose,
The trumpet roused them from their brief repose,

For no sweet interchange of cheerful light,
In these dark realms, divides the day from night.
Not theirs " ambrosial morning's roseate ray,"
Or the mild lustre of departing day.

Now every chieftain, in a spacious plain,
In martial order rang'd his vassal train,
The king appointed there his bands to join,
Thence watch the motions of the adverse line, 290

Till spent and weakened by internal broils,
The prey should fall in Oreichalcon's toils.

And lo! Albruno comes; on either side,
Before their king, the subject bands divide;
He darts his eye o'er each extended line,
And sees, with pride, such squadrons round him shine.
Six giants here, the patriarchs of the state,*
His chosen guards, in barbarous grandeur wait;
Unbent with age, the vast Granites bearsf
The gather'd weight of twice three thousand years; 300

* The six primitive rocks; granite, porpby^, marble, serpentine, schist,
and sienite.

t The word regavtrns, geranites, granite, has sometimes been derived from
r£f&lt;*vo?, geranos, a crane, as its colours are supposed to resemble those of the
stork's neck; but its name is more commonly supposed to have originated in
its granular structure.

Those varied hues his stubborn corslet deck,

That grace the stately crane's o'erarching neck.

Ophites' garb fair Steatite bestow'd,^

In crimson arms was Sienitos drest.§

Next, rang'd in order, the metallic line
Around their leader, honour'd Chrysos, shine.

His peaceful robes aside the monarch flung,
And sought the fight, though still he feared to find
This seeming safety veil some ill behind,



* Porphyry is usually found in smaller blocks than granite, and porphy-
rytic mountains do not attain so great a height.

t Pure primitive marble is distinguished by its sparkling, or sparry frac-
ture, and unblemished whiteness.

t The various and beautiful tints frequently observed in ophites, or ser-
pentine, are owing to the admixture of steatite, or soap rock. 

§ Schist is said to derive its name from its bright and shining appearance.
Sienite, not differing greally in its composition from granite, is frequently of
a dull crimson.

The pride and boast of many an eastern land;
Of hardest texture fram'd, their armour bright
Shone through the gloom in lines of dazzling light:
In former combats with the powers of fire,
Immortal glory did these troops acquire;
Nor less their argillaceous brethren claim

* Stypterion, from STwrrjjpia, alumine or clay, pure argillaceous earth, one
of the most indestructible substances in nature, and parent of all the gems
known by the name of oriental, and included in the barbarous terra Corun-
dum: the oriental topaz, emerald, and sapphire, &amp;c. &amp;c.

Nothing can be more different than the characters which alumine imparts
to the gems and to the earths; in the first, hard, brittle, brilliant, and pellu-
cid; in the second, opaque, devoid of lustre, and exhibiting, when broken,
an earthy fracture. The argillaceous earths are soft to the touch, but harden
by fire, absorb water greedily, retain it obstinately, and form, when moisten-
ed, a ductile and tenacious mass. When exposed to the action of heat they
become, first of a bluish black, then white; they contract and exhibit variou?
cracks and fissures, but fire has no farther action upon them, except in in-
creasing the contraction. On this account pyrometers have been construct-
ed of clay, with the hope of being able to measure very high degrees of tem-
perature; but they are uncertain, as the clay does not contract uniformly in
the same heat, and is almost as much affected by the duration, as the increase
of temperature.

t Silex is one of the hardest substances in nature, and the bodies in which
it abounds are abundantly diffused. It enters into the composition of the

render it so. Siliceous stones are more or less transparent,,nave a fine polish,

* Adamas, the diamond, which, though usually placed at the head of the
gems, is very different in its composition. No bodies can differ more in ex-
ternal appearance, than charcoal, plumbago or black lead, and the diamond,
yet their chemical analysis affords similar results. The diamond burns, like
plumbago and charcoal, into pure carbonic acid, and the difference in their
aspect probably arises, either from a slight excess or deficiency in the oxygen
combined with the carbon, or perhaps only from the different form and ar-
rangement of the particles in crystallization. In coal mines, the stratum of
coal is occasionally seen passing, by sensible gradations, into plumbago-
Some have supposed plumbago to be charcoal united with iron. Charcoal
and plumbago are excellent conductors of electricity, but the diamond is a
perfect non-conductor, which strengthens the idea that, it contains a portion
of oxygen combined with its carbonaceous basis, as this gas, however small
in quantity, always destroys conducting power in the body with which it is
combined .

t Barytes and strontia have not long been added to the catalogue of
earths, and the stones in which they are predominant are not numerous.
The barytic stones are particularly distinguished for their weight, which long
before the discovery of the metal barium, by Professor Davy, gave rise to
the suspicion that they must contain a metallic basis. They have a spongy
appearance; when exposed to heat they emit a phosphorescent light, and
they may be scratched with a knife.

The colour of strontia is generally whitish or light green. It's surface is a
little shining in parts, it is brittle, has a slight transparency, and may be
scratched with a knife.

Who, swift as glancing arrows, scour the plain,
Their lines unbroke, the fierce assault sustain,
Till to the charge the impetuous Pyros came,
On his fierce courser, born of wind and flame,
Of old, by poets sung, and Rabican his name.*
With all his force his flaming lance he cast,
The troops divide, the weapon harmless past. 460

The monarch rush'd between, in vain they close, J

His rapid steed the astonish'd ranks o'erthrows: V

His lance regain'd, alone, mid countless foes, 7

Speeds the victorious chieftain; in alarm,
The Gnomes affrighted, fly his potent arm;
His spear resistless spreads destruction round,
And vanquished heroes strew the smoking ground.
When brave Stypterion cheer'd his generous band,
Who pale with shame and rage inactive stand:

" All is not lost, my comrades, turn and face 470

" Your foes — redeem the glory of your race!
" 'Twas not for this we claim'd this honour'd post,
" Awhile let Pyros triumph, while his host
'* Shall feel our veugeance, and redeem our boast;
" Our boast, the longest to contest the field,
" The first to conquer, but the last to yield."
So spake the indignant chief, and as he spoke,
At Pericautheis aim'd a mortal stroke;
Again, in firmer lines, his squadrons close,
And brave the impetuous onset of their foes. 480

But fate still guided Pyros' conquering spear,
And death behind him stalk'd, before him fear.
First Theion fell, in arms of yellow hue,
And snowy Nitron next his fury knew,
At the first stroke, his arms in fragments fell,
And with an angry shout he bade the world farewel.*
Next, in his sable hauberk, Carbon came,
And stopt awhile the impatient Lord of Flame,
Without a wound, his fiercest blows withstood,
And then retired, repulsed, but unsubdued.f 490

Titauos next he quell'd; his fiery dart
The chieftain's corslet pierc'd, and reach'd his heart,
Their leader's fall his troops with terror fill'd, \

In flight dispers'd, an easy prey they yield \

To Pyros' slaught'ring arm, who chas'd them o'er the field. J

The trembling Gnomes with fearful wonder view'd
Whole squadrons by a single arm subdued.
To check the king, advanc'd two chiefs of fame, \

Of races different, tho' alike in name, \

Their shields, their surcoats, and their arms the same; 500 J
In eastern climes one holds extensive sway,
And one Iberia's noblest Gnomes obey.
The foes of Bacchus, they in times of old
By secret bonds the insidious god control'd,
Onward they prest, by shame and rage impell'd,
And broke their lances on his lifted shield.
The king unshaken, with fresh fury burns,
And each his blow with mightier force returns,
When, wondrous change! beneath his potent spear,
In different garb, the rival chiefs appear; 510

Late in Aurora's purple glory cirest,

Now Amethystos wears a silvery vest;

Unhurt he stands; a pure effulgence play3

Around his form, that mock'd the diamond's blaze:

The Carthaginian by the blow was laid

A milk white corse, and all his lustre fled.*

Doubtful this change if fear or spells had wrought;
The monarch turn'd, and fresh opponents sought.
When now Asbestos, trusting in his might,
Provok'cl the conquering chieftain to the fight.
So long his arm the powers of fire had brav'd,
So oft his monarch and his army sav'd,
Each adverse warrior lied his arm appalPd,
And he th' Invincible was justly call'd.
Yet slender was his frame; no plated vest,
No temper'd arms secur'd his manly breast,



* The oriental amethyst is a variety of corundum, differing only in co-
lour from the oriental sapphire, topaz, and ruby. When exposed to heat
it loses its colour, and is of such dazzling brilliancy as to be frequently mis-
taken for the diamond. The occidental or common amethyst is merely
quartz, tinged naturally of a deep violet hue, by iron or manganese. It
likewise loses its colour in the fire, but at the same time is deprived of its
lustre, becomes opaque, and of a milky white, owing to an infinity of small
cracks which are discoverable by the microscope. It is chiefly found in the
neighbourhood of Carthagena in Spain. The Greeks and Arabians wore the
amethyst as an amulet to prevent drunkenness, whence its name a^Qva-Toi.

Loose to his feet his Persian garments roll'd,

His head envelop'd in the turban's fold;*

Yet nor the diamond's streugth, nor harden'd steel,

Could like those flowing robes the dart repel. 530

They met; and long unmov'd Asbestos bore
The utmost efforts of the fiery power,
Long seem'd almost the victor, till at length
So fierce a contest wasted all his strength:
He fell; a deadly pale his features wore,
White as the stones on Santorina's shore.f
For Conquest from her sapphire throne on high,
Long wont on him to cast a partial eye,
In love still fickle as a mortal maid,

In all her glory Pyros now array 'd. 540

Delusive flatterer! didst thou only come
To dress a lovelier victim for the tomb?
Didst thou Abestos' fame and prowess raise,
To add new glories to his rival's praise?



* Advantage is here taken of the flexibility of the asbestos to give a little
variety to the costume.

t The pumices of the island of Santorine and others appear from analy-

nature of that mineral proves the great potency of the volcanic five which
has produced them.

Ah! think how deep will be his sovereign's sighs,
What tears will burst from Amiantha's eyes,
What grief will sadden all his kindred train,
Who " ne'er shall look upon his like again!"

While Pyros thus the conquer'd legions slew,
The rival king his bravest bands o'erthrew, 550

And many a sprite of fire in death deplor'd
Albruno's prowess, and his absent lord.
Brave Dalos first; for vanquish'd in the strife,
His stiffening breast resigh'd the flame of life.
Next Spodos, but no better fate he found,
His mangled limbs were scatter'd on the ground.
Their lot next Causimos and Anthrax share;
And now to meet him march the valiant pair,
Phlegon and Thermos, of illustrious race,
Cut with Pyrodes share their friends' disgrace. 56Q&gt;

Now with Ignicomus in fight he stood,
His arm at length the fainting sprite subdued.
Swift was Pyrenemos, but swift in vain,
Albruno's lance transfix'd him to the plain;
As vain Pyrigenes, thy strength, thy pride,
And vaunted lineage to thy king allied.

Next came Micante, bold but lovely maid,

Her graceful form in glittering arms array'd;

By proud Albruno's sword her father died,

She dropt no tender tear, nor shriek'd, nor sigh'd, 570

But from her limbs she tore the flowing vest,

.And seized his plated mail, and nodding crest,

" Be mine," she cried, " the warrior's stern attire,

" Until I perish, or avenge my sire!"

Albruno's mightier arm her lance defies, ~\

Soon at his feet the lovely victim lies, \

And death in darkness clos'd her radiant eyes. }

Pyraustes flew to save, but flew too late,

He fell, and shared his loved Micante's fate.



But now a straggler from the routed baud 5S0

ReveaPd the deeds of Pyros' slaught'ring hand;
Much mourn'd the king Abestos', Calcios' doom,
And hastes to save the living from the tomb.
Alike Albruno's glories Pyros knew,
To aid his troops with equal haste he flew;
On fierce Albruno came — to meet the sprite
The fiery monarch rushes to the fight;
On either side their hosts die war suspend,
And eves and ear&lt; in breathless silence bend.

First the proud Gnome his shining lance impell'd, 590

Which pierced, resistless, Pyros* blazing shield,

Drove thro' his crimson corslet and his vest,

But melted ere it reached the monarch's breast.

Next Fire's brave king; but, guiltless of a wound,

The spear at distance quiver'd in the ground:

He Pyrapblectos drew, his wondrous blade,*

In eardi's most secret cells by magic made,

By fire intense, unquenchable, illum'd,

For ever burning, ever unconsum'd.

Full on Albruno's head the blow descends, (500

And from his helm the glittering crest it rends;

While faint, and staggering o'er the plain, he felt

The mighty prowess which the blow had dealt;

Loose on his nerveless arm his shield was slung,

And o'er his eyes the mists of darkness hung.

Against his breast now Pyros aims his sword,

His faithful Gnomes stood trembling for their lord.

Nought now can save him — Yes! the gift of love,

Recovering now, again Albruno sway'd
With firmer grasp his adamantine blade.
With equal strength, and nYd with equal rage,
In fiercer fight the rival chiefs engage,
The blows to shun, alike they turn, they bend,
And swifter now the weighty strokes descend:
Loud clash'd their arms, and from their falchions bright,
Shields, helms, and corslets, stream'd the dazzling light-
But Oreichalcon chose this moment dire, 620
To lead his troops to join the powers of fire;
Sublime, upon his burnish'd steed he rode,
That steed which erst the Tartar King * bestrode:
Which, at his master's bidding, soars on high,
And treads the trackless azure of the sky,
Skims the bright surface of the emerald wave,
Or sinks from sight to earth's most secret cave.
In regal pomp the Gnome his band precedes,
Behind, his troops the recreant Chalcos leads.
Wondring they find, to check their swift advance, 630
The expected friends extend the hostile lance,
Surprized, they scarcely raise the guardian shield,
And vanquish'd numbers spread th' ensanguin'd field;

But on his flying steed the Gnome arose, }

And floating o'er the fight, with ceaseless blows, &gt;

Now here, now there, assails the unwary foes; j

First fell Pyrauges, in his brilliant course

Crush'd by the fury of the magic horse;

Pierc'd by his spear, the brave Perustos died,

His brazen falchion cleft Aleinos' side, 640

But vain his valour; to his crimes decreed,

Justice meanwhile prepared the traitor's meed,

Pyrobios gave the wound; his arms no more

Their golden glow and soft effulgence wore,

Or vied with Chrysos — like his dusky sire,

They shew the dark red hue of fading fire;*

In vain on high he turn'd his brazen steed,

In vain he urged " enchantment's arrowy speed,"

As swiftly Phlogos, with dilated size,

And lifted lance, pursues his trembling prize, 6.30

Arrests his flight, and, with resistless force,

Destroys at once the rider and the horse.

Now Chalcos came; contending passions swell'd
His labouring bosom, and his arm impell'd:

* The zinc, which gives to brass its yellow colour, flies off at a much
lower temperature than the copper.

Now on his shuddering view his treason broke,

And conscience, with her thousand stings, awoke:

He felt his hopes for ever laid in dust; ^

His honour blighted by his broken trust; V

He mourn'd his son, but own'd his doom was just. J

His fiery eyes with rage and vengeance glare, 660

He fights with all the fury of despair,

On Phlogos flies, his breast unguarded leaves,

And in his heart the fatal wound receives.

Their leader slain, dismay'd and spent his line,
In hasty course, their kindred Gnomes rejoin,
The fiery train the flying foe pursue,
The armies join, and all the fight renew.

Now Spintheros on stern Sideros flies,
Beneath his arm the Gnome expiring lies;
An equal fate Cobalto, Nickel, knew, 670

And on Tellurio next the warrior flew.
At Calaminos, Phlogos aim'd his dart,
And Kapnos plung'd his falchion to his heart.

But in the Sprite he found an equal foe,
Who fought untir'd, and echo'd blow for blow.

Thick stars of gold adorn'd his crimson vest,

His crimson helmet bore a golden crest;

But from Pyrides' arm a single stroke

Thro' crest and helm, and spangled corslet broke;

His soul exhaling at the ghastly wound,

His members sunk, divided on the ground,

When Adamas, impell'd by shame aud ire,

Provok'd to fight the youthful Prince of Fire.

Surprized, he found, beneath a stripling's form,

The skill and firmness of a veteran's arm;

Yet long he bore the light; but faint at length,

As he relax'd his rival gather'd strength;

By slow degrees his force, his limbs decay,

His earthly form, exhausted, wears away,

The Sylph alone remains; his mother's charms

Uniting with his former strength in arms,

On airy wings he floats above the war,

Shakes his thin vest, and wields his slender spear,

Turns on his foe, and grasps his crested head —

Prone at his feet the expiring prince is laid.

On victor still, thro' crowded ranks he goes;

A single stroke annihilates his foes;

In vain they raise the shield, or strike, or fly,

He does but breathe, they fade, they sink, they die.

Swift as a pest advanced the sudden ill,
Such numbers fell, that few reniain'd to kill;
Tir'd with the work of death, he left the fight,
And soar'd to air to claim a Sylphid's right;
Yet still, as mindful of his former birth,
He shuns the heights, and lingers near the earth,
In caves secluded flies the face of day,
Nor sports and flutters in the noontide ray;
And near his cell if stray the sprites of fire,
Beneath his arm their smother'd hosts expire.*

But whence proceeds this sullen murmuring roar.
Like billows breaking on a rocky shore?



* The diamond, when exposed to the action of fire, burns (as already
stated) into pure carbonic acid. This gas possesses the property of extin-
guishing flame, and is equally destructive to the slow combustion of animal
respiration. It is heavier than common air, in the proportion of 4? to 31,
and this density in some degree opposes the tendency of gaseous bodies to
universal diffusion, so that an accumulation of carbonic acid gas is frequently
found near the floors of caverns, (as in the celebrated Grotto del Cane, at
Naples,) at the bottom of deep wells, and of large beer vats; also in mines,
where it passes by the name of the Choak Damp, and is often productive of
the most fatal effects, as persons who inhale this poisonous air have no
power to withdraw themselves from its influence, but fall instantly senseless,
and those who hasten to their assistance arrive but to share their fate. In
descending to such places, it is always prudent first to lower a candle, as a
test of the atmosphere, as wherever that will burn, man may breathe.

* The fixed alcalies, potash and soda, were known to the chemists of Bag-
dad as early as the reign of the Caliph Haroun Alraschid, and the word alcali
is of Arabian origin. The alcalies are possessed of the highest degree of ne-
gative electricity. As oxygen, even in minute quantities, destroys conducting
power, and as the alcalies are perfect non-conductors, it was supposed that
they consisted of oxygen united with a basis, but of what nature was un-
known, since they successfully resisted every effort that was made to decom-
pose them, and had hence obtained the name of fixed alcalies. Professor
Davy happily thought of applying to them the energies of voltaic electricity,
and triumphing by his ingenuity over the difficulties presented by their want
of conducting power, he obtained the most glorious and unexpected results in
the discovery of their metallic bases, which he denominated sodium and
potassium. The discovery of the alcaiine metals quickly led to that of four
others, which he named from their parent earths, calcium, magnium, barium,
and strontium. These metals have all a high metallic lustre, but on exposure
to the air they immediately begin to tarnish, in a few minutes they are covered
with a white crust, and by combining with the oxygen in the atmosphere re-
turn to their original earth or alcali. When thrown into water, the aviditj-
with which they enter into combination with oxygen is so great that they take
lire and burn in the fluid. Potassium alone, which is lighter than water in the
proportion of six to ten, floats and burns on the surface. From this eagerness
of combination in these metals, and from their lightness, it is necessary to
keep them in naphtha, the lightest fluid known. Silex, alumine, zircon, and
glucine, have, like the other earths, given indications of metallic bases, but as
these have not been obtained pure, Professor Davy does not think himself
authorized to call them metals.

In addition to the six metals that owe their birth to Professor Davy, M.
Berzelius, the Swedish chemist, has obtained a seventh more unlocked for
than any, in the metallic basis of ammonia, the volatile alcali. If a lew drops
of solution of ammonia be poured on a large globule of mercury, or if the
mercury be placed in a cup of carbonate or muriate of ammonia, it immedi-

ately expands to six times its former bulk, and is converted into a soft solid,
which is an amalgam of ammonium. As yet this metal has not been obtained
pure, and its proportion in the amalgam is so small, that the least contact
with the air is sufficient to regenerate the ammonia.

The metallization of ammonia has opened new views in chemistry, and
appears to prove that neither the gases nor the metals are simple substances.
Ammonia consists of hydrogen and nitrogen; these gases therefore are capa-
ble of becoming metallic, and as in so doing they must suffer decomposition,
they cannot be simple substances, neither can the metal which is formed by
their union. Hydrogen, which, from its extreme levity, has been assumed
as unity in the scale of definite proportions, is probably simple, while nitro-
gen, which bears the higher number of 26, must be supposed a compound.

Professor Davy thinks there is probably one basis for all the metals, and
one for the gases. Some time since he said that he thought he had found a
path which would lead to the discovery. It is much to be wished he would
pursue it.

What grief in reverend Chrysos rose, to find
Fulfilled the bodings of his prescient mind!
He call'd on Phlogos to suspend the fray;
Their leaders' voices both the hosts obey.
" W 7 hile we," he said, " our partial fight maintain,
Behold what slaughter'd squadrons strew the plain;
Ah! what avails it if to thee I yield,

Or thou, o'ercome, shouldst press the empurpled field, 7 80
Short were our glory; while yon foes are nigh,
We fight to fall, and triumph but to die.
Then let us now our mutual hate resign,
And join our arms to meet yon hostile line."

Lost its shrill note amid the din of war;

Or mix'd in combat, or o'ercome by fear,

And those who hastened at the bugle's sound

Were faint with toil, and gor'd with many a wound.

When Phlogos spoke: " Tho' lasting shame repay

Not more that chief deserves, when hope is lost, ^

Who madly rash, maintains an useless post,

And vainly falls amid his falling host. j

Our troops are spent and few, an easy spoil

And lead to combat on some happier day."

" Wise are thy words; alike should courage know,"
The Gnome replied, " to aim or stay the blow,
And none who fear or glory in thy might,
Dare call thee coward — our retreat a flight."

IVIeanwhile, imprison'd in Cimmerian gloom,

Young Henry sate, expectant of his doom;

'Twas now the time when from the cavern far

Albruno's chiefs their squadrons led to war;

No lightning flash'd, no thunder shook the ground,

Unbroken shade and silence reign'd around.

He sigh'd — " How long must I in darkness dwell,

The lonely tenant of this silent cell,

While to this dreary realm, through ways unknown,

Maria strays, unaided and alone!

Oh! who shall now her erring steps direct,

In fear sustain her, and from foes protect!

Or who, and soon the fatal time must come,

Oh! who shall guard her from the treacherous Gnome!

Yet still unshaken faith in Ariel's power

Shall brace my mind to wait the eventful hour;

And here, tho' night her thickest veil display,

Seraphic Hope shall beam a mimic day:

E'en now her radiance seems to pierce the gloom,

A sudden splendour fills the vaulted room, 20

Again she calls me to the realms above,

Restor'd to light, to liberty, and love."

Not hope or fancy's power supplied alone
The dawning light that thro' the cavern shone,
Gave to the languid air a sudden spring,
Or shook sweet odours from the zephyr's wing,
But clad in all the majesty of light,
Great Ariel's self dispell'd primeval night.

" What madness fill'd thy mind, rash youth!" he cried,
" The fort to enter, in its lord confide? 30

" His craft in courteous phrase but half conceal'd
" Too well the unaccustom'd law reveal'd.
" But let not vain regret the hours consume;
" Haste! quit these realms of heart-appalling gloom.

Self loosen'd, dropt the adamantine bands.
As Gnomes disguis'd, unmark'd they swiftly tread
The caves that seem'd interminably spread;
At length they reach'd a spacious plain; on high
A ruby sun illum'd a sapphire sky,
Shed on the distant hills a crimson beam,
And shone reflected in a silver stream.
On emerald stalks, and bright with crystal dew,
Earth's richest gems in flowery semblance grew; 50

And spartium blooms in imitative gold;
The hyacinth of amethystine hue
Shines near the paler gentian's sapphire blue;
And on its slender stem of glittering green,

Or Moslems bound to Mecca's holy shrine;

Or such the Indian temples, vast and grand,

By Delhi's monarchs raised on Jumna's strand.

Yet, oh! how small, this giant fabric near,

Proud man! would all thy loftiest works appear; 80

The Egyptian piles, Sophia's vaunted dome!

Or the famed structures of majestic Rome!

One moment paused the adventurers, then in haste
The lofty portal's ample arch they past,
Tread the rich pavement of the vaulted ile,
And mount by jasper steps the central pile;
They reach the council-hall; at Ariel's hand
The valves that radiate golden light expand.
The pavement gay with various marbles shone;
High rose the monarch's amethystine throne; 90

An azure dome the splendid chamber crown 'd,
Where mimic stars the silver moon surround.
There giant Draco's snaky volumes roll,
The northern team, the bear that guards the pole;
There bright Andromeda and Perseus shone, 1

And Cassiopeia on her glittering throne, V

Malignant Umbiiels baleful hand unties
The fatal bag of passions, sobs, and sighs,
" Full o'er their heads the swelling sack he rent,
" And all the furies issued at the vent."*
There Juliana quits the realms above,
In Idria's mine to tend her banish 'd love,
And braves the baleful fogs and noisome air,
Resolved his toil, his lingering death, to share,
With anguish pines his fading form to see,
And weeps Theresa's harsh but just decree,

These, as he slowly left the council-hall,

Through many a spacious gallery Ariel led;
Their steps a small secluded chamber staid.
Before a throne of ruby hue behold
An emerald tripod grac'd with sculptur'd gold,
Where firmly bound by adamantine chains,
A crystal vase the fatal Veil contains.

Like that strange gem instinct with life and light, 140

That self suspended shines and chases night. #
Unconsciously as Henry near it stood,
Himself restor'd to native form he view'd.

" That glass," said Ariel, " framed by magic charms,
" Reflects substantial and ethereal forms;
" No nice disguise the real shape conceals,
" Its power the bosom's inmost thoughts reveals.

« To share with magic, wreaths by valour gain'd,



Its power the treacherous Acban's fraud betray 'd,

cle, which is fully detailed in a note on Thalaba.

Mov'd from the spot, and thus impassion'd said. J



* The story of Cambuscan, the brazen steed, the virtuous sabre, ring, and
glass, as begun by Chaucer, are well known; but this passage alludes more
particularly to its continuation and conclusion by Mr. Wharton.

Cambuscan, released, by the assistance of the falcon, from his aerial pil-
grimage, having by these enchanted gifts discovered the treachery of Acban
and Erbol, and conquered the invading array commanded by Aulum, the
sovereign of Ophir, becomes touched by religious scruples respecting the use
of magic, and resolves not to be indebted to it for his future safety or glory.
He therefore vows, as soon as the nuptials of Algarsife and Theodora, of Ca-
nace and Al Kabal, (the gentle heir of Ophir's throne,) and of Cambal with
Zelica, (formerly the falcon,) have been solemnized, that he will bestride, for
the last time, the brazen steed, and ascend the highest summit of Caucasus,
there to leave, beyond the reach of mortal hands, the sabre, glass, and ring.
Hence Albruno redeemed the glass.

" Why pause we thus, while none the deed oppose,
" To snatch this prize from our unheeding foes?
" Foiled in his art, if we the pledge regain,
" The baffled Gnome may rage and storm in vain."

While thus he speaks, his eager arms he strains
To reach the casket that the Veil contains,
But Ariel seiz'd his arm, and flung him far:
" Desist, mad youth, nor thus destruction dare!
" Fixt by Albruno's power, this casket stands, 180

" Nor moves, nor opens at another's hands;
" W T hile touch' d by hidden springs, his snares surprize
" The unconscious wretch who seeks the fatal prize.
" Yet had its loss fulfill'd our bold design,
" Or fraud, or force, had borne it from the mine;
" But know, the casket, from his reach convey'd,
" Frees not the promise of the hapless maid,
" Himself alone, tho' gain'd by fraud his power,
" Must yield Maria, and the Veil restore.

" But hark! what means this sudden noise without? 190
" That mournful cry, and that exulting shout?
" Those varied sounds the finished fight declare,
" Haste, quit the palace, ere the Gnomes appear."

Soon they beheld where Chrysos' faithful train
In solemn silence bore Asbestos slain;
With eager looks, as slow they mov'd along,
Around the chief the anxious numbers throng,
To mourn Asbestos, of the fight inquire,
And learn the doom of brother, friend, or sire:
As various fates attend them, beauty's eye
The soft effulgence beam'd of hope and joy,
Or shone more keenly thro her streaming tears,
As brighter light thro' polish'd glass appears.
By contrast heighten'd, there delight and fear,
Despair and joy, and love and hate appear,
As the sun's radiance on the mountain's brow
In double darkness shews the glen below.

Than all more fair, now Amiantha came,
While strange forebodings agitate her frame.
Scarce could the chief the trembling accents hear,
That told at once her wishes and her fear;
But while she waits his slow reply, the maid,
With looks aghast, her brother's corse survey'd:
She shriek'd, — then o'er him bent in silent woe,
While grief too great forbade her tears to flow.

On her his glistening eye brave Chrysos turn'd,

The maid he pitied, and the brother mourn'd;

But gathering numbers force him to declare

The changeful fortunes of the fatal war:

How Pyros rag'd, how Adamas had fought,

What mighty deeds Albruno's prowess wrought;

And here the nymph half rais'd her from the bier,

And half forgot her brother's loss, to hear

The glorious trophies of Albruno's spear.

But when, while fortune crown'd their first desire,

And from the fight their fainting foes retire,

He told how false Marino's squadrons came,

And whelm'd at once the hosts of earth and flame, —

Then Ariel from the croud young Henry led,

" The war recalls me from these realms," he said;

" For rash Marino, either chief o'erthrown,

" May quit these kingdoms and assail mine own.

" But here thy guide, this faithful magnet, view,

" Still to the north thy steady course pursue,

" And soon shalt thou the rocky frontier gain,

" Where Oros guards the passage to the main.

" This wand in slumber shall his senses steep,

" And shield thee from the monsters of the deep.

" 'Tis here thy safety, but thy danger there. '2 -10

" Last, take this casket; dark its surface seems,

" Yet it, condens'd, contains ethereal beams;

" This slender spring unlocks the hidden rays,

" Pure and exhaustless as the solar blaze:

" This lights thy progress: swift thy course pursue,

" Maria's welfare is my care — adieu."

So swift the monarch vanish'd from his sight,
That Henry's eye could scarcely mark his flight.
The lamp he took — thro' many a cavern vast,
Whose scatter'd crystals glimmer'd as he past, 250

Thro' clefts which freezing floods in rocks had made,
Or air confm'd, or struggling fires, he stray'd,
And many a vein of mineral wealth explores,
Where the rich metals slumber in their ores;
There gold's rich purple was luxuriant seen,
And iron's red, and copper's brilliant green.
Oft on the earth the issuing flame reveals
The treasur'd hoard the barren soil conceals.*

* Lambent flames on the surface often indicate metallic veins, particu-
larly of gold, even at a considerable depth. They are supposed to arise from
the evolution of hydrogen, or other inflammable gases, in consequence of the
decomposition of the ore. Saussure and others mention this phenomenon.



110 THE ESCAPE. book hi.

And now he past a mass of shining ore,
Whose polish'd face a silvery lustre wore, 260

But as, by chance, the guiding lamp he rais'd,
His lifted arm the glittering surface grazed;
Slight was the touch; and, patient of the stroke,
No fragments shiver'd from the stricken rock;
But when another night had past away,
And all the Gnomes in peaceful slumber lay,
A loud explosion shook the caves around,
The Gnomes, astonish'd, hasten'd at the sound;
Vast was the chasm, and like untempered glass,
In thousand atoms laid the broken mass.* '2/0

Now chang'd the scene — no more in solid blocks.
Of size immense, ascend the lofty rocks;
Disjointed, broken, every cleft contains
Alluvial earth, and organiz'd remains.



* This peculiar character is the property of a species of leaden ore, with
a smooth and shining face. The slightest scratch on the surface spreads
gradually through the mass, and, after some hours, it bursts with a violent ex-
plosion, and its fragments are dispersed in all directions. In one of our
mines in Derbyshire, the ore is of this description. The miners scratch it
slightly, in various directions, and then leave the mine, and await the explo-
sion, which, perhaps, does not take place till two days after, and usually
makes a great chasm.

The strata now proclaim their watry birth,

And grasp the harder nucleus of the earth;

The fragments here in mouldering ruin hurl'd,

Of many a race that fill'd the early world,

Where watry relics earthborn tribes surround,

And tropic fruits in polar climes are found; 280

Where bodies chang'd, a mineral lustre give,

And buried forests still in coal survive;

The strata now erected, now deprest,

Now disappearing, now again confest,

The events of unrecorded time declare,

Sad monuments of elemental war.

Here in calcareous rocks, vast torrents force
The snowy bed of their impetuous course;
Or from the fires that burn unquench'd beneath,
Thro' narrow clefts sulphureous odours breathe. 290

A city next he reach'd: — as crystal clear,
The ramparts high, and domes of salt appear.
Such was the pile where lovely Bertha dwelt,
While Ufo's form the strange enchantment felt,

Until the seventh revolving moon restor'd

Again to human shape her dolphin lord.*

Here lamps dependent mock the blaze of day,

And all within the faithless walls betray.

Sprightly, and high in bold Marino's grace,

His subjects once, here dwelt an active race. 300

Now conquer'd by Albruno's arms, his sway,

With vain regret, the vanquish'd tribe obey.f

* See " The Three Sisters," a tale, translated from the German. Bertha,
the third daughter of " the Baron," is the wife of Ufo; who, for six months,
is enchanted in the form of an immense dolphin, violent and implacable,
and retaining no vestige of humanity but his speech. During this time,
his only amusement is in swimming round a little island, on which is
built a small habitation of the clearest crystal, where his lady resides, and
boils her solitary cup of coffee. The seventh month, however, restores the
enchanted Ufo to his shape; he becomes a gay and powerful prince, a kind
complacent husband. The lake spreads, the isle expands, Bertha's ceil grows
a splendid palace; the trout and other fishes jump out of the water, and be-
come courtiers, and all is splendour and hilarity till the expiration of the
month again condemns them to the waves. One pleasant circumstance at-
tending this mode of life is, that Bertha, though married one-and-twentj
years, and not undergoing any transformation, has, in that time, like her hus-
band, grown only three years older.

t Darwin has given a description of the salt mines at Cracow, in Po-
land: but our own at Northwich, near Chester, though, perhaps, not so
beautiful, appear to be of greater importance, and their produce of finer
quality, as it is exported even to the neighbourhood of Cracow. Mr. Hol-
land has published a long and very interesting account of the rock-salt of
Cheshire, in the first volume of the Geological Transactions. The salt is
confined to the southern or central part of the Cheshire plain, and chiefly to
the valley of the Weaver and its tributary streams, and is generally indica-
ted by salt springs. At Lawton there are three beds, separated by strata of
indurated clay. The first bed, at the depth of 42 yards, four feet thick; a
second, 10 yards lower, 12 feet; a third, 15 yards lower, he.s been sunk into



book in. THE ESCAPE.

Soon Henry past them, soon he hears the roar
Of billows breaking on a distant shore.
A rock of granite insulated rose
Where mighty Oros' giant limbs repose,



24 yards, but its depth has not been ascertained. In every part of the rock
are found separate crystalline concretions of muriate of soda, sometimes cu-
bical, and sometimes in large irregular masses, usually of a greyish or milk-
white colour; and possessing greater or less transparency: the salt no where
appears stratified. The great body of the rock presents only a confused red
mass, varied here and there by the crystalline portions. No marine exuviae,
or organic remains, or impressions, are found either in the salt, or in the ar-
gillaceous strata. In some parts where pillars, six or eight yards square,
form the supports of the mine, the effect, when lighted up, is so splendid as
to realize the magic palaces of Arabian fiction. Eleven or twelve mines are
now worked, and from 50,000 to 60,000 tons raised annually. The greatest
part is exported to Ireland, the Baltic, and Prussia; the remainder is manu-
factured in Cheshire.

There are many other salt mines, in Spain and Portugal, in Transylvania,
and in Austria, and also in Africa. The mountains and beds of salt, between
Tripoli and the Pillars of Hercules, have been noticed by Herodotus, but 1
they are not so regularly situated as he has described. He also mentions,
that the inhabitants built their houses of salt, a custom they still retain. " It
never rains," he observes, "otherwise such structures could not be durable."
A sudden shower would in that country injure the houses of the inhabitants
more than the wear and tear of many years. This salt, like that of Portugal,
is usually of a purple colour, but that which is washed down by the dews
4Vom the mountains becomes white when it crystallizes, and loses the bitter-
ness which usually characterizes fossil salt.

Mr. Bruce speaks of salt as very abundant in Abyssinia; mines are work-
ed near Azab and at Dancali. The salt, cut into solid bricks of eight or ten
inches long, supplies the place of our small money. A very portable cur-
rency! perhaps rather more so than the iron money of Lycurgus.



114 THE ESCAPE.

While stretch'd around the shore, a faithful band,
The bold Basaltes, giant warriors, stand,
A hardy race, and garrison the land.*



* Even a slight attempt to discuss the long contested theory of the forma-
tion of basaltic pillars, would far exceed the compass of a note. Perhaps
both the Neptunists and Plutonists might spare their labours and renounce
their alternate triumphs. The most commonly received opinion is, that the
basalt, rolled in a semifluid stream from the mouth of a volcano, and coming
in contact with the sea, contracts in its sudden refrigeration into the prisma-
tic form: but unfortunately, prismatic basalt is found in many parts of the
world, and even in our own island, in situations where there appear not the
slightest traces of volcanic fire, and again where it would be as difficult to acr
count for the presence of water at its formation. But perhaps these columns*
though similar in appearance, may not always be alike in origin: and fire
and water, separately, or in conjunction, may equally have been concerned
in their production. The basalt, rendered fluid either by the agency of wa-
ter or volcanic fire, and suffered slowly either to evaporate or to cool, would,
by the laws of crystallization, naturally assume a regular form, and the per-
fection of the columns would depend on the length of time allowed in their
formation.

Saussure, in his Travels in the Alps, speaks of many sandstone rocks having
a tendency to split into rhomboids. In the " Passage du Bon Homme,'' he
says:

" Vers le bas de la descente on trouve des chalets que je m'etonnai de voir
" construits en pierres de taille, d'une forme tres reguliere; je demaudai la
" raison de cette recherche, peu commune dans les montagnes, et j'appris que
" c'etoit la nature qui avoit fait tous les frais de cette taille. Effectivement,
" je trouvai un peu plus bas une profonde ravine, creusee par les eaux dans
" des couches d'un beau gres, qui se divise de lui-meme, et que Ton voit dans
" sa position originelle, actuellement divise en grands parallelepipedes rec-
" tangles."

Is not this the effect of crystallization? and may it not throw some light on
the formation of basaltic columns? for no one would think of referring the pro-
duction of sandstone to volcanic fires.

* Volcanic eruptions are known to be connected with the flowing of water
into subterranean caverns, and therefore probably owe their origin to the
contention of fire and water, and the expansive force of steam. This conjec-
ture appears to derive strength from the Geysers, or boiling fountains of Ice-
land, which throw up immense columns of steam to the height of 100 feet,
with such force as to sustain bodies of considerable weight, and which un-
doubtedly arise from an immense reservoir of water continually boiling be-
neath that wonderful island; that strange mixture of frost and flame, where
the inhabitants of the pole and of the equator might find their accustomed
temperatures without losing sight of each other. The Geysers, with the ex-
ception of some springs near Bath, are the only known waters which contain
silcx in solution. Sir George Mackenzie, in the account of his Travels in
Iceland, has given a very interesting description of these intermittent foun-
tains of steam, and a probable theory of their origin.

Professor, now Sir H. Davy, has imagined volcanic eruptions to arise from
the metals of the earth, which existing in a pure state, beyond the contact of
air and oxygen, are suddenly inflamed at the influx of water. The confla-
gration thus kindled might afterwards be extended and supported by other
substances.

And mid the clash of arms, the ceaseless din,

Back by his arm the clouds of smoke were driven,

Again the moon illumes the azure heaven;



rolling through various systems, and kindling on their entrance into our
atmosphere. During their inflammation, they throw off those bodies called
meteoric stones. That these bodies actually fall from the clouds appears
now scarcely to admit a doubt, both from their peculiar composition, and
the number of evidences that attest the fact. Meteoric stones have been
frequently found hot, immediately after the passage of a meteor. Their
elements invariably consist of iron, silex, magnesia, and nickel. The three
latter ingredients are sometimes in such small quantities, as to leave the iron
almost pure, and constituting what is called native iron. This iron is very
different from that procured from the ore, which seems to arise from the
mixture of nickel': it is harder, takes a fine polish, resists tarnishing, and is
always magnetic. There is a large mass of this iron in Siberia, weighing
650 pounds; in Peru there is another of the enormous weight of 15 tons,
and there is one similar at the Cape.

Professor Davy has imagined, that meteors, whether planets or otherwise,
may have consisted originally of the pure metals of silex and magnesia,
united with iron and nickel. The two former would necessarily ignite on
meeting with the oxygen of our atmosphere, and the meteors passing off to
other systems, leave a part of their substance as a compensation for the weight
of oxygen acquired.

But where the building wrapt the ground in shade,

Forth from the gloom emerged a lovely maid.

She, like a phantom, burst upon his sight.

" Nor rest nor sleep are mine," the maid replies,

" Must find us far upon our toilsome way,

" Our harness'd steeds now wait beneath yon tree,

" So waste not time in words, but follow me."

Thro' the thick covert of a lofty wood,
The travellers long their rapid way pursued;
At length less thick arose the leafy screen,
And moonbeams trembled thro' the waving green.
More thinly scatter'd, now the trees display 'd
Less towering height, and less majestic shade;
Now short thin grass and purple heath alone 490

Clothe the bleak summits of the chalky down;
And when the ocean burst upon their sight,
Its waves just trembled in the dawning light.
" Oh, haste," the maiden cried, " our lingering course;
" My vessel waits." She urged her foaming horse,
And Alfred followed. Soon the glowing skies
Cast o'er the deep Aurora's purple dyes;
And, as they reach'd the strand, Hyperion gave
A golden tincture to the sparkling wave.
But now the cock was heard, and at the sound 500

Swept the bright surface of the tranquil seas,

And raised the silken scarf that screen'd with care

The damsel's features from the morning air,

While Alfred gazed in hope once more to prove

The sweet enchantment of her looks of love;

But, tho' as fair as ever painter drew,

'Tvvas not Miranda's face — her eye of blue

Ne'er shew'd the ungovern'd anger and despair .510

That mark'd the features of the stranger fair.

Sudden her voice assum'd its softest tone, -

Her looks were mournful, but their rage was gone;

Her bosom seem'd to struggle with a sigh,

A tear to tremble in her downcast eye.

" Alas! yon rising sun — too soon betray 'd,

" My sweetest hopes are fled!" exclaim'd the maid.

" Yet stay, dear youth! and let thine heart approve,

" At least my fraud forgive, the fraud of love!'

" And hear my prayer — yet, ah! too well I see 520

" By one blest effort break the fatal chain,

" And turn from her whom fate denies, to one

" Who lives, and feels, and breathes for thee alone,

" In me behold a daughter of the wave,

" Now let me waft thee to my coral cave.

" Oh! lovelier far those regions of the main

" Than bards can paint, or eastern fancy feign;

" Our wealth and pomp might tire a miser's eyes;

" But Alfred's heart can wealth and pomp despise!

" In those blest realms we neither feel nor fear

" The seasons varying with the changing year.

" With you, when summer smiles or winter lours,

" Unfading spring and equal warmth are ours;

" And when the moon deserts your dreary night,

* The inhabitants of the sea are usually depicted by poets as far exceeding
in wealth and splendour the denizens of earth.

Water is a very bad conductor of heat, whence the beams of the sun must
play upon its surface long before their influence penetrates to the interior;

fluence of cold can be severely felt at any great depth. The bottom of the
sea must therefore be much more equal in its temperature than the surface of
the earth. Its temperature is probably nearly as low as 42° of Fahrenheit,
that at which water acquires its greatest density. The specific gravity of all
other bodies, fluid or solid, increases in regular progression with the abstrac-
tion of heat, but water, which contracts in bulk down to 42°, afterwards
again expands, and is, at 32°, the point of congelation, specifically lighter.
A cold breeze blowing over the ocean soon cools the upper stratum of water
to 42°, and renders it heavier than those below. It sinks, and another
warmer and lighter usurps its place; this becoming cool, in its turn again de-
scends, and the process continues till the whole body of water becomes
cooled to 42°, and congelation commences at the surface. From this pecu-
liar law, that no part of a body of water can freeze until the whole mass be
cooled down to 42°, many tracts of ocean, that would otherwise be impassa-
ble half the year, are hardly ever frozen, and the congealed surface itself
serves as a protection to the interior.

Many of the smaller tribes of marine animals are luminous in the night,
and their light may be useful at depths which the sun's rays hardly penetrate.

At length he thought, — " When first my eyes survey'd

" This fort, whose fatal law my steps betray 'd,

" In western skies the setting orb of day

" Tipt its high turrets with a lingering ray;

" Dark rose its walls embattled on the sight,

" And grimly frown'd amid the crimson light,

" Hence westward lies the fort — that course pursued,

Fresh hope and strength the welcome thought bestow'd,
Less thick the wood, less toilsome seem'd the road.
And soon the Castle's rising towers he sees
O'er the high summits of the waving trees.
Arriv'd, for entrance long in vain he calls. —
The surly warder answer'd from the walls:
" No second entrance here our laws allow
" To recreant warriors who forget their vow,
" And leave their posts unguarded in the night; —
" The maids departed with the dawning light."

He spoke: suspicion fili'd Alonzo's breast, 620

Tho' all unwont to harbour such a guest:
His brave companions vanish'd from his sight;
Himself deluded by the magic knight;

From his protecting arm the maid he loved;

All from one common source appear'd to spring, —

The jealous hatred of the fiery king.

" 'Tis false!" he cried; " the maids are here, and I

" Will win a passage to their sight, or die."

Now to the walls the wily Baron came; 630

" Sir knight," he said, " your own base conduct blame;
" In vain with rage an entrance you demand,
" We scorn the prowess of a single hand.
" But come and prove, the maids no longer here,
" Alike unjust your anger and your fear."

He ceased: — the drawbridge falls — Alonzo's mind
Already half its late distrust resign'd.
He past, and turning, wild with anguish, found
The bridge again uprais'd, himself on hostile ground;
The vassals, at their fraudful lord's commands, 640

Prepar'd to bind him in ignoble bands;

But vain his strength, the villain fought secure,

In skill, but more in temper'd armour, sure.

Alonzo's sword, unfaithful to his hand,

In shining fragments glitter'd on the sand.

Yet still his art eludes the coming blow,

And grasps with sinewy arms his hardy foe. 650

Long was the strife, as o'er the narrow plain

Struggling they fight — retreat' — advance again.

The Baron's limbs to time and labour yield,

Prest by his foe, he sinks upon the field;

At this, long peals of thunder shook the sky,

The fallen chieftain fled Alonzo's eye:

The walls, the towers that caught the morning beam,

The moat, the drawbridge, vanish'd like a dream!

He mark'd the change; then sunk in trance profound,

And woke, where Genoa stretch'd her bay around: 660

'Twas on a vessel's deck, prepar'd to sail,

The joyful crew observe the rising gale;

The swelling canvass spread, the ship unmoor,

And seek (with him) the Liparean shore.

Meanwhile the maids, who, in a dungeon's gloom,-
All night imprison'd, had bewailed their doom,

Now saw the walls in air dissolve away,

And hail'd the sudden flash of purple day.

Amaz'd, upon the vacant plain they stood,

Where their freed palfreys cropt their verdant food; 670

When thus a voice was heard — " Dismiss your fear,

Cheer'd by the friendly voice, the nymphs obey;
Their steeds, spontaneous, take the destin'd way;
And, when a secret fear their looks betray'd,
Thus Leonora cheers each drooping maid.

The scatter'd pearls around its border hung;

Miranda rose, and by their margin stray'd,
Impatient of her friend's expected aid,
When on the tide she view'd a bark that bore
A graceful damsel lightly to the shore;
But ere it touch'd the strand, a mist profound
Cloth'd in a fleecy veil the scene around;
So thick, it scarce allow'd her eye to trace

" Tho' dense around the morning mists extend,
" Trust the sure guidance of thy faithful friend;
" My bark ne'er courts the breeze's varying force,
" No oars impel, no rudder guides its course,
" I do but bid, at noon or night the same,
" It moves unerring to its destin'd aim:
" O come! our cause admits no vain delay." —
She enter'd; swift the vessel glides away.
In silence pondering on her doubtful fate,
Beside her friend, Miranda mournful sate;
Slowly the mists disperse, and all around
The heavens alone the wide horizon bound,
While o'er the tide her eyes explore in vain,
For Albion's vanish'd cliffs, the dazzling main.
But now the vessel stops, the waves divide,
And seem a glassy wall on every side;
Down to the bosom of the deep it goes,
And o'er their heads the crystal arches close;
At length they reach a realm of purest air,
Where, far above, the waves like clouds appear;
And thro' their lucid veil with soften'd ray,
The emerald sun diffused a milder day.
Here, as on earth, tall woods and hills ascend;
Here cities rise, and fruitful vales extend;.



Each flower that loves the limpid rill to drink,

Or bend in beauty o'er its verdant brink,

Meandering, thro' a garden's ample bound.

The bright Nympheas graced the sparkling tide,

Numerous the tribe! a modest blush was seen

O'er the fair face of Nilus' sacred queen,*

Her rival, bright Nelunbia, grac'd her side,

Her glowing charms in deeper crimson dyed;

She blest the Samian sage, whose wise command

Her embryo offspring saved from luxury's hand.f



* The lotus of Egypt, sacred as the emblem of fertility, and honoured
with the title of the Spouse of the Nile, is a large aquatic plant of the
genus nyraphea. The. seed is made into a kind of bread and baked, and the
root, which is round, and about the size of an apple, is also eaten.

The Egyptian lotus is a very different plant from the lotus of Lybia,
whence the lotophagi derived their name. The latter is a shrub, (a species
of rhamnus, the rhamnus lotus of Linnjeus,) and is disseminated over the
borders of the Great Desert, from Cyrene, round by Tripoli and Africa
Proper, to the borders of the Atlantic, the Senegal, and the Niger. Its
fruit is about the size of an olive, has a purple hue, and is sweet like a date.
It is a principal article of food with the tribes bordering on the Desert; and
the lotophagi appear to have received that name from the circumstance of
living chiefly upon it. A kind of wine is also made from this fruit.

t The nelunbiura, or sacred Indian bean, the nymphea of Linna?us, and

cyamus of Dr. Smith, is a magnificent plant, and its flowers, from their size

and colour, are compared by Herodotus to the rose. This plant has, like the

lotus, been the theme of much controversy. Herodotus has described it as

L 3



150 THE SEA.

At love's fond call, here Valisneria fair,*
Her spiral stem uncurls, and floats to air;



growing in the Nile, and Dioscorides has said that it abounds in Egypt, but
no modern traveller has been able to find it there. In speaking of the root
of this plant, which, he says, is eaten, Herodotus has probably confounded
it with the colocasia, a plant that grows abundantly in the inundated places
near the Nile, and produces at all seasons broad green leaves, not much un-
like those of the nymphea lotus, but its flowers are little noticed, as the roots
are eaten previous to the period of flowering. The nelunbium is at present
common in India, and writers have conjectured that it may have been trans-
planted thence into Egypt, and not being indigenous in the soil, has subse-
quently perished. Its fruit, which Herodotus compares to a wasp's nest,
contains numerous esculent seeds, about the size of an olive stone, and some-
what like a bean. These, he says, are eaten, both raw and roasted. Dr. Smith
has imagined this plant to be the real mystical bean of Pythagoras, the use
of which that philosopher prohibited to his disciples; and supposes that he
imbibed this notion of it in India, if ever he travelled thither, or in Egypt,
whither it had been transplanted. This plant is held sacred by the Bramins,
but the kernels are almost universally eaten by the Hindoos, and are said to
be of a pleasanter flavour than almonds.

* The valisneria has perhaps little right to a place with the large and spe-
cious flowers already mentioned, but the wonderful mechanism it displays
will always render it dear to the botanist. Valisneria is of the class dioecia,
or two houses, having the male and female flowers on separate plants. It is
an aquatic plant, and grows at the bottom of rivers and ponds in Norway, in
France, in parts of Italy, and in the East Indies. The female, or fertile
flower, has a spiral stalk which remains coiled up at the bottom of the water,
till the flower is perfected. It then uncurls, and the flower rising floats on the
surface. The male flowers, on the contrary, have a very short stalk, which
breaks off close to the stem previous to their expansion, and they spring up
to the surface. Their petals are there unfolded, and the pollen of the anthers
is wafted on the stigma of the female flower, which being fertilized, its stalk
coils up, and it descends again to the bottom of the water, where the seeds
are ripened. Dr. Smith is of opinion, that if the flower be not rendered
fertile, its stem loses its irritability, and neglects to coil itself up again. The
male flowers, though small, are so numerous as often to cover the surface of
the water for a considerable distance.

The beauteous labour of her artful hands,
Here all the unnumber'd treasures of the wave,
In rich profusion, deck'd the spacious cave;

And here its kindred Nautilus outshone*

The mountain-snow, or cygnet's spotless down;

An unknown inmate forms the beauteous frame,

Rais'd by its bitterest foe to light and fame,

His stronger arms the peaceful lord expell, 70

He mounts triumphant to the conquered shell;

Far o'er the seas the foreign pilot sails,

Spreads his slight web, and courts the favouring gales,

And hence, with imitative art, mankind

Unfurl the swelling canvass to the wind:

The subject seas Britannia's navies ride,

And every wind, that sweeps the foaming tide,

Wafts a rich tribute to her island throne,

And makes the wealth of distant worlds her own.



• There is no shell that has acquired more celebrity than the paper nautilus,
which is supposed to have given to man the first hint of the art of sailing. The
tenant of this shell expanding a thin membrane to the influence of the wind,
and at the same time moving its tentaculae, sails with rapidity over the ocean.
I have said the tenant of this shell, for the animal usually found in it, does
not appear to have been its builder, and neither in form nor structure corre-
6ponds with the mansion it inhabits, or with the inhabitants of the other nau-
tili. It is a species of cuttle fish, which probably, like the soldier crab, and
some others, seizes the discarded shell of the nautilus, and converts it to its
own uses. The different cameras of the shell are perfectly useless to this ani-
mal, and could never have been formed or inhabited by it: it resides only in
the outer chamber.

Beam'd their collected charms from every part.

Of finest sand the grotto's floor was seen,
Snow-white, and smoother than the shaven green;
Rich seats of scarlet coral grac'd the pile,
Where countless myriads ply their ceaseless toil.

often weighing from 120 to 140 pounds. The force of the shell in closing is
sufficient to separate a cable, or lop off a limb, and the water spouts up to
three or four feet distance. The chama gigas is a native of the Pacific Ocean,
and is very frequent in museums.

She spoke: at her command the waves that spread
A mass of fleecy clouds above their head,
In many a pendant column, forming slow,
Sinks towards the ground — the river boils below.
To meet the lowering skies its 'waters rose,
And walls of seeming glass the grot enclose.

The sea re-echoes her triumphant strain,
The distant sound lies mournful captive hears,
Those notes of joy augment her fruitless tears.



Tormenting state! her steps no massy chain,

Xo brazen doors, no lofty walls detain:

She views the scene around, serene and clear, 120

She breathes a light ethereal atmosphere,

Yet by that lucid barrier more secured,

Thus, (like a diver in his crystal bell,)
Aranea lives within her airy cell,
Rears her young offspring in this secret cave,
And insulated breathes amid the wave.-j-

The dongeon was, in which her bound he left.

That neither yron barres, nor brasen locke

Of all her lovers which would her have reft;

For wall'd it was with waves, which rag'd and ror'd

As they the clifFe in peeces would have cleft.

Besides ten thousand monsters foule abhor'd

Did waite about it, gaping, griesly, all begor'd."
t In the water-spider, which forms its nest at the bottom of water, we find
a very curious contrivance to supply it with air in this situation. This animal
has the power of swimming. It ascends to the surface of the water, and re-
turns laden with a large bubble of air, which it preserves unbroken amid the
pressure of surrounding waves. This operation is frequently repeated, till a
considerable reservoir of air is collected around the nest, in which the spider
lives and rears its little family, surrounded by their own peculiar atmosphere,
and literally "insulated amid the waves." The spider has the power occa-
sionally of dividing this reservoir into two or three cells.: — Roget's Lectures.



But now impatient, to her pearly car
Fair Marguerita calls the lingering fair,
But calls in vain, — her friends in wonder stand, 130

Then seek their vanish'd partner on the strand. —
A rock abrupt and insulated stood,
Its rugged head impending o'er the flood;
There sat a warrior — Soon his pictur'd shield
And sable arms Miranda's knight reveal'd;
Yet false the hopes that now their breasts inspire,
In vain their lips Miranda's fate inquire.
" Oh! ask not me! by magic arts betrayed,
" I left the fort and that transcendant maid;
" And had not chance Lymnoria's face reveal'd, 140

" She now had borne me o'er yon azure field,
" In ocean's darkest caves to watch and weep,
" Or glut some savage monster of the deep!
u Reviled and scorned, too late I knew the dame,
" Who mock'd Miranda's voice, Miranda's name;
" In vain my weary steps my love pursue,
i{ Nor know I where to seek, if not with you."

Thus Alfred spoke: with grief the damsels hear.
While Leonora's voice augments their fear:



" Oh, Alfred, haste; perchance, like thee, betrayed, 150

" The caves of ocean hide the hapless maid;

" Haste, Marguerita, haste, ere yet too late,

a Perhaps a moment lost decides her fate."

 The nymph young Alfred follows; o'er the seas
Speeds their light bark, nor heeds the adverse breeze;
Tho' slight its frame, its strength the waves defied,
And swift as lightning skimm'd the sparkling tide,
No brilliant hues its dark-brown surface shows, ~1

Within the opal's changeful lustre glows, V

And o'er their heads a graceful awning rose. l60j

Soon to the warrior's eager eyes were lost
The snowy cliffs that mark'd the distant coast,
Whence long their anxious friends their course pursue,
And gazing, wave them many a kind adieu.
By Albion's shore their rapid way they steer'd,

Then by the rocky Orcades they past,
And view'd, at distance, Norway's forests vast;
And soon they shiver'd in the icy breeze
That swept the surface of the Arctic seas.

And fogs eternal shroud the frozen pole;

Or when the trees in richer livery clad,
Of gold and crimson spread their mingled shade,
Their charms increasing in their slow decay —
There, soon matnr'd, as soon they fade away:
Like the bright rainbow in a summer sky,
They rise, they bloom, they ripen, fade, and die!

On sail'd the bark secure, but soon, uprear'd
Above the waves, a hideous form appear'd;
His head was like a steed's, in many a fold
Round his long neck the thick tough skin was roll'd;
Six flatten'd feet his mighty bulk sustain,
And bristled on his back his yellow mane;
The boa, largest of the serpent brood,
Were weak and small, if near this hydra vievv'd;
Ten fathom long his snaky form was seen,
And high he rear'd his head of dusky green.*
Lymnoria's envoy, at her will he came
To crush the knight, and more detested dame.



* This descri prion is exactly copied from an account accompanied by a
sketch, given by Mr. Este in his Lectures at the Royal Institution in 1809,
of the sea-snake that was stranded on one of the Orkneys in 1808. Its length
was fifty-five fc?et; but as part of the tail was wanting, the animal had probably
measured at least sixty, when perfect. The head resembled that of a horsr.



The bark he follow'd o'er the wat'ry plain,
And hiss'd aloud, — and lash'd the foaming main,
And strove to wreathe it in his spiral train.
But forth, attentive, Marguerita drew
A small brown ball, and at the hydra threw;
Its potent scent the offended monster fled,*
And on its course the little vessel sped.

New dangers now impend; thro' mountains vast
Of gather'd ice, a narrow streight they past.
Oh! should the sun's meridian fervour launch
From yon dread height the threat'ning avalanch;
Or should the waves impel some floating rock,
They sink or perish in the dreadful shock!
And lo! impatient of the expected prey,
O'er the firm ice a bear pursues their way;



The neck was ten feet long, but only two feet in circumference. It had six
flat feet. The colour was a dusky green, and a thick yellow mane stood up
on its back.

* The castoreura, or castor, may be called an animal gum resin. It is a pe-
culiar secretion of the beaver. It usually comes to England in small balls of
a reddish brown colour, and covered with a tough membrane; it has a bitter
unpleasant taste, and a very peculiar and strongly disagreeable odour. The
best castor comes from Russia, and the ordinary sort from Canada. The pilots
of the north are said to provide themselves with this drug, to preserve them
from the attacks of the sea-snakes, infesting the Arctic Ocean, to whom its
smell is particularly offensive,

Behold! the waves the icy rock divide;

In its clear side, the opposing glacier gave;

The vessel here preserv'd, the sever'd mass

Impetuous rushes thro' the narrow pass.

* The Ilircynian forest, formerly celebrated as the haunt of large fero-
cious beasts, contains stupendous monuments of their existence. For two
hundred leagues extend an immense number of caverns lined with stalactiti-
ous concretions, and ilieir floors covered with bones. Two thirds of these
belong to two species of bear which no longer exist. These animals must
have Jived and died in the caverns where their remains are (bund; and as
carnivorous animals are solitary, each cavern must have contained only one,
or perhaps a pair. What a long succession of generations does this render
necessary, to produce the accumulation of bones which lias long supplied
the apothecaries of Germany with phosphate of lime, and still remains to
excite the wonder of the naturalist! Cuvier, $c.

But now the sea in larger waves was seen,
And snowy foam emboss'd their dusky green;
And soon the vessel hasten'd in its course,
Felt of that current the attractive force,
Where 'twixt Hefleggen's mount, and Ver's wild shore 250
Round Moscoe's isle, the eddying waters roar:
That current dread, which borne by adverse winds,
With chilling fear the wretched seaman finds,
Laments his danger, now too late descried,
And vainly struggles with the increasing tide,
Then sinks unable with its force to cope,
And cries in vain for aid he cannot hope;
Or marks its course the fatal vortex near,
lu all the dreadful calmness of despair.*

By turns the vessel sunk, by turns it rose, 260

On waves that threaten o'er their heads to close:

to an incredible distance, and vessels sailing among the islands of ice, in
high latitudes, often hear a double report, first and loudest from the ice, and
afterwards, much more faintly, from the air. Davy.

* Even whales and other animals, coining within the influence of the
Maelstrom, appear instantly sensible of their danger, struggling and making
a frightful noise but in vain. They are borne along with increasing rapidity,

A crystal vase fair Marguerita held,
Aud o'er the seas a liquid balm distill'd,*
Sudden the foaming breakers cease to rave,
Calm is the sea, and sunk the furrowed wave;
The mountain billows rise on either side,
Between, the vessel skims the tranquil tide,
And fearless to the current's force resign'd,
Leaves a smooth track of silver light behind.
Within the dreadful vortex now they came, 270

Wbirl'd in swift circles by the rapid stream;
At once the angry waves forget to roar,
Their calm as wondrous as their rage before:
" Now speed thy course, my bark," the damsel cried,
' And snatch the moment of the turning tide."
She spoke: but scarce the central point they gain,
Ere, with redoubled fury, boil'd the main,
And whirl'd, with giddy motion, round and round,
The bark absorb'd descends the abyss profound.



* The power of oil, in stilling troubled waters, is well known; though
without the assistance of a sea-nymph, it might not be advisable to try its
efficacy in the Maelstrom. At the turn of the tide, it is said, that the waters
are for a few minutes nearly calm, and that fragments of shivered timber are
then " refunded on the refluent wave."

And, as in air, he breathes amid the wave.

Dark clos'd the foaming waters o'er their head,

And scarce a beam of straggling light was shed,

While, chafed by rugged rocks, the waters flow

Thro' narrow channels to the realm below.

And scarce their utmost care the vessel guides,

From sure destruction on the rocky sides.

At length, the widening track admits a ray 290

Of pallid light, to cheer their dreary way;

The angry waves retire, and safe they land,

Tho' faint with toil, on the subaqueous strand.

Onward, thro' shady grots and sunny meads,

Her wondering guest fair Marguerita leads,

Who, in amazement, finds this realm unknown,

Gives of the flowers that round its margin grow.

vious to plunging with his nephew, Prince Beder, into the water, places oa
his finger a ring, engraved with the same words as those on Solomon's seal,
by virtue of which he is endowed with the power of breathing in the water.



But whence that song, the.' distant, sweet and clear, 300

That falls so soft on Alfred's wondering ear?

Well may he hasten, well his heart rejoice,

He hears, and knows Miranda's plaintive voice.

" Far from his home, how sad the captive's doom,

" The loathsome dungeon's solitary gloom;

" His lamp expiring casts a feeble ray;

u No sound of man, no beam of cheerful day

" Breaks the dead calm, he meets no friendly eye,

" Alone the echoes to his moans reply.

" But sadder is my lot, condemn'd to see 310

" The bliss forbade, and mock'd with liberty.

" On yonder hills that catch the morning ray,

" How sad at evening sunk the waning day,

" Sad was the calm the evening twilight shed,

" Grief seem'd to sleep, and hope itself was dead.

" How coldly fair, this green effulgence falls

" That cheer'd my path, while youthful fancy wove 320
" Her fairy dreams of happiness and love:

" When, with the cheerful confidence of youth,
" I listen'd, Alfred! to thy vows of truth,
" And thought thy love so sure a source of joy,
" The storms of life might pass unheeded by.
" Oh! whither art thou fled, what bonds restrain,
" What spells delude thee, or what walls detain:"

The captive ceased; for who is yonder knight,
And who yon nymph? So sudden was the sight,
It almost seemed that fancy but defined 330

Those forms so strongly imaged in her mind;
The grottoes with her shrieks of joy rebound;
Far off, Lymnoria started at the sound.
Alas! in vain those cherish'd friends are seen,
The wall of waters fills the space between.
In vain fair Marguerita lifts her hand,
The stubborn barrier spurns the nymph's command;
But Alfred's mind recall'd the ring that gave
Its wearer power to breathe amid the wave.
He passed the glassy frontier, and in haste 340

The golden circlet on her finger placed:



She leaves the cave rejoicing; but in vain
Thro' the clear wall would Alfred plunge again,
In denser mass the angry waters rose,
And rolling back, a narrower space enclose.

" Oh, fly," he cried, " ere yet some stronger spell
" To this sad grot again thy steps compell.
" If thine the Veil, Marino's arm shall lend
" Its powerful succour to release thy friend;
" If he reject thy suit, bereft of thee, 550

" This grot, or Albion's isle, alike to me."

Her captive scarcely fled, Lymnoria came,
Amazement, anger, seized her trembling frame.
" Fly, artful wretch," she cried, " yet dare not hope
41 Thy strength, thy power, thine arts, with mine can cope.
" For thee, mad youth, thou ne'er shalt boast again, ^
" Lymnoria's love rejected with disdain,
" That heart, which braver warriors seek in vain. 7

" What, tho' I feign'd, yet had I truly strove,
" As much thy pride had scorn'd the proferr'd love! 360
" This thought, should mercy seek to quench the fire,
" To deadlier hate shall rouse my slumbering ire.

: Soon shall a stronger fence thy love secure;
A trusty guard shall make thy prison sure.
I will not rest till her my spells enchain,
Till envying nymphs shall follow in my train,
And hail Lymnoria empress of the main."



Thus spoke the nymph: the knight his steady eye
Fix'd on Lymnoria, but disdained reply.
She left the grot: in anxious thought he sate, 370

That hour decides his loved Miranda's fate.

Henry, meanwhile, pursued his way; amaz'd,
On all the wonders of the deep he gaz'd.

* The actinias or sea anemones, and sea marigolds, have received the name

Many of them are of very brilliant colours, and when their tentacular are ex-
panded, they have the appearance of full blown flowers. They feed on small

Still on the ruins of their race renew'd:

Where scarlet flowers mid verdant foliage glow,

And dusky fibres seem to twine below;

Mid azure tufts and blossoms silvery white,

Where purple fruits the wondring eye invite;

On coral rocks the lofty trees ascend;

The beasts shall roam, the birds their nests shall frame,

And man at last his new dominion claim:



shell-fish and other marine animals, which coming within reach of the expand-
ed tentacula;, arc immediately seized and drawn into the mouth, which
closes over them. The shells, and other indigestible parts, are afterwards re

Perchance his hand may turn the shallow soil,
And wondring pause, and tremble for the isle,
Alarm'd to see the crystal waters flow,
And play and sparkle mid the sprays below.*
As, through the trackless air, the feather'd race,
With speed untir'd, pursue their rapid chace,
Or sportive wheel in many a mazy ring,
Now soar on high, now sink on idle wing;
Thus o'er his head the finny nations glide,
And lash with strenuous tail the sparkling tide.



* The coral islands are formed with a rapidity that is astonishing, whether
we consider the great depth from which they rise, or the extreme minuteness
of the animals that produce them. It is chiefly in the Pacific Ocean that
this growth of coral takes place, where many large islands are continually
forming, and rise up, from immense depths almost perpendicularly, to the
surface of the water. The sea then gradually filling up the interstices of the
coral with mud and sand, a soil is formed, and by degrees the islands be-
come the rich and fertile abodes of man and animals.

Captain Flinders seems to have been particularly struck with the variety
of form and colour presented by the corallines on the reefs of New Holland,
or Australasia, " equalling in beauty, and excelling in grandeur, the most
favourite parterre of the curious florist."

Some of the animals that form the coral, seem to live in a kind of common-
wealth, their bodies being connected by a net-work of nerves. It should ap-
pear, that the food received by one affords benefit to the whole community,
»o that if one of them be indisposed to eat, he may subsist on the nutriment
communicated by others.

The growth of coral is much less observable in European seas, or in thft
Atlantic, except near the West Indies and in the Red Sea. There is coral
in the Streights of Messina, and Spallanzani has given 'a long account of ths
Sshery there. — Rogefs Lectures.

* Many of the larger tribes of fishes feed on the smaller kinds, and are
exceedingly voracious, but most fishes appear to derive their subsistence
from the element which surrounds them. Perhaps the medusae and other
minute animals which inhabit the water, may contribute to their nutrition.
Among birds which assemble for periodical migrations, those which fly first
of the troop, eat up the country, and are strong and fat, while their unfortu-
nate followers, unable to find sufficient provision, are weak and emaciated,
and fall an easy prey to the tygers and hyenas that prowl behind. But in
fish, where the shoals are infinitely more numerous, this is never the case,
and the last of a shoal of herrings or of rcackarel, is in as good condition as
its predecessors. Did the majority of fishes require any other food than
what is afforded by the water which surrounds them, where would the im-
mense multitudes which inhabit the ocoan find provision? It would be gree-
dily devoured by the larger tribes, and they would be left to perish by fa-
mine. — Roget's Lectures.

t This is not precisely true with all the bivalve shells; some of them pos-
sess a slight power of locomotion. The oyster, for instance, by rapidly open-
ing and closing its shell, is able to effect a slow and laborious motion from
place to place, the reflux of the tide impelling it slightly at every action.

Their tender frames the shining shells defend, 420

Form as they form, and with their growth extend;

Not theirs the power to urge their rapid way,

And gain each moment on the flying prey,

Yet little arts minuter tribes allure,

Firm on their native spot, they brave the storm,

And still increasing, grace the rock they form.

Of motherpearl and shells united fram'd, 430

With burnish'd gold and glittering gems they flam'd;
Sudden, as breathing from some flowery land,
The wanderer's cheek a fragrant zephyr fann'd:
Surprized, he felt its breath, and turning found
His steps unknown had past a viewless bound,
Behind his track the distant waves appear,
Before, a light subaqueous atmosphere.
By gorgeous palaces, and stately groves,
O'er verdant hills, and cultur'd plains, he roves;
Beholding, as he past, with wondering view, 440

The ocean nymphs their various toils pursue;



Some seek the cooling rills or leafy bowers,
Prune the green shrubs, or tend their opening flowers;
Some for their grots, gay shells and minerals sought,
Some their thin webs of fine-spun coral wrought,
Wound thro' the snowy pearl the golden thread,
Or the light dance iu sportive mazes led,
Their tuneful part in songs harmonious bear,
Or draw thro' combs of pearl their yellow hair.

But now a well-known voice to Henry's ears, 450

Miranda's loss, and Alfred's grief declares.
Beyond the garden's flowery maze was seen
The grotto, glittering thro' the foliage green,
Where Alfred sate, the aqueous wall behind,
Like some unhappy insect, amber-shrin'd.
A monster guards the gate — his bulk was roll'd
Voluminous, in many a scaly fold;
He rears his sparkling crest — but what avails
His breath of fire, his adamantine scales,
His venom'd fangs, or fascinating glance, 460

That chills its victim, ere the foe advance!*

* A great deal has been said respecting the power of fascination supposed
to be exerted by serpents over small animals: Dr. Liehtenstein, in his
Travels in Southern Africa, has recorded an instance of it. On the brink of a
ditch, he saw a large snake in pursuit of a field-mouse. " The poor animal was



Great Ariel's spells the intended bound arrest;
A sudden sleep his glowing eyes opprest;
Senseless he fell, the warrior past the gate,
And reach'd the spot where mournful Alfred sate.
He wav'd his wand, the waters glide away,
As evening frosts before the morning ray;
The astonish'd youth a joyful greeting gave,
And sprang exulting from Lymnoria's cave.

But now the ocean peers in council sate,
Not oft accustom'd for their king to wait,
Tir'd with the labours of the march and fight,
Vain was the summons of the morning light;
At length he comes, assumes his shelly throne,
And makes the business of the morning known.



just at its hole, when it seemed in an instant to slop, as if unable to proceed,
and without being touched by the snake, to be palsied with terror." The
head of the snake was raised over him, the mouth open, and the eyes sted-
fastly fixed on him. Both remained some time in this position, but as soon
as the mouse made a motion to fly, the snake followed it immediately, as if
he would stop him. After some minutes, the noise made by Dr. Lichten-
stein's approach alarmed the snake, who snapped up his prey instantly, and
glided away into a bush. The Doctor appears rather to ascribe this pheno-
menon to the poisonous breath of the snake, which he thinks might really
paralyse the limbs of the mouse, than to any influence of its fixed eye, or the
dread of inevitable death.



" My friends," he said, " in toil and danger prov'd,
" Still faithful found, respected and belov'd,
M Time urges on; attend your king's request,
" And by your actions be your zeal exprest.

" When next the morning sun illumes the tide, 480
" Here will the spell conduct our destin'd bride.
" Great were the shame, if we, in war's alarms,
" Forgot the homage due to beauty's charms;
" Then be our court in all its pomp array 'd,
" Let tilts and tourneys greet the chosen maid;
" Such splendour in your arms and dress be seen,
" As fits the welcome of your future queen;
" And let our nymphs with care and homage sweet,
" The lovely wanderer as a sister greet,
" By every kind attention smooth the change 490

" To realms unknown, and modes and manners strange.
" Nor unattended must the damsel come
" To this subaqueous clime, her future home;
" Let Cuma, and Lymnocharis the fair,
" With speed to Albion's chalky strand repair,
" There Potamos, Plemura, Clydon wait,
" To guide her passage to her subject state."

He ceas'd; yet still the parting chiefs delay'd,
For still in musing mood Marino staid;
Perchance fond fancy trac'd the form and mien, ,5C

And all the beauties of his bride unseen.
When lo! two damsels to the presence came.
Whose graceful forms might colder hearts inflame:
The one a veil's depending folds conceal'd,
The other shone in all her charms reveal'd,
And all unbound her flowing locks appear,
Those golden locks that every heart ensnare.

Amaz'd, the enraptur'd king her charms survey 'd,
And hop'd before him stood the appointed maid,
For well her roseate bloom betray'd her birth, 51

No ocean nymph, the lovely child of earth.
Meanwhile, Miranda view'd his gentle eye,
And gracious smile, with mingled hope and joy;
Yet paus'd the bashful maid, and fear'd to find
Those gentle looks bely a sterner mind.

" Blest be the events unknown," exclaim'd the king,
" That to these realms so fair a stranger bring!
"•' If ours to grant, we grant thy boon unheard.
" Or as a favour be thy suit declar'd,



book iv. THE SEA. 17?

" If wealth can aid, our treasur'd stores command, 520
" If arms, ourself, and all our subject band!"

Before his throne she fell; the monarch tried
In vain to raise her, while she thus replied:
" Thanks, generous king! but till thine answer seals
" My future fortune, here thy suppliant kneels;
" Nor arms, nor wealth can aid; for tho' unknown,
" The boon I crave depends on thee alone.
" Soon will the charm's resistless force compel
" A weeping victim to thy regal cell,
" Unless thy soul relenting, shall resign .530

" The Veil that joins Miranda's fate with thine;
" Vain were thy love, thy splendour, to impart
" One throb of pleasure to her bleeding heart,
" For tho' thy graces might her favour claim,
" The heart once pledged, admits no second flame;
" O'er her young mind a valiant warrior reigns,
" Whom captive here a cruel nymph detains,
" His freedom grant — let my entreaties move,
" And wed a nymph who gives thee all her love;
" Before thee now she waits, in hope and fear — 540
" Oh! crown those hopes, and grant my earnest prayer!"

Miranda ceas'd — delighted and amaz'd,
The amorous monarch on his suppliant gaz'd;
He deem'd the maid who spoke the enamour'd fair,
And little thought Miranda's self was there.
And when, as she of Alfred dar'd to speak,
The rose bloom'd deeper on her bashful cheek,
With joy he mark'd the radiant tint that glow'd,
But to himself transferr'd the love it shew'd;
For we, ourselves still anxious to deceive, 550

Hope what we wish, and what we hope believe.
With eager voice — by sudden love inflam'd,
u I yield the Veil!" the fickle king exclaim'd,
" On charms unseen my fancy feeds no more!
" Haste! Clydon, haste! Miranda's pledge restore,
" Yet! ere you part, be here your homage shewn,
" Here, to the destiu'd partner of my throne!
" And thou, bright fair, in happy moment seen,
" Receive the vows that hail thee as my queen."

The monarch mark'd with transport, as he spoke, 560
The glow of joy that o'er her features broke,
But wondering, saw that glow as soon decay.
As sudden clouds obscure the April day.



BOOK IV. THE SEA. 179

" Alas! my generous lord!" she cried, " I claim,
" The sport of wayward fate, Miranda's name!
" Yet if this form have rais'd one thought of love,
" Oh! let that thought thy mind to mercy move,
" Still let thy generous hand my pledge restore*
" And leave me not more wretched than before."

As in their course the advancing hosts were staid, 570
When Jove's brave son the Gorgon's head display'd,
E'en thus, by grief transfix'd, Marino stood,
And the fair maid with looks of anguish view'd.

" Tho' from my breast its sweetest hope is riven,
" Love must not triumph o'er a promise given."
At length he said — " My adverse fates prevail,
" Blest be thy future hours, and thine the Veil!
" Yet ere a gift so valued I resign,
" Find me some maid whose form may equal thine;
" Nor let her outward charms alone allure, 580

" Her eyes an index to a mind as pure:
" If such the maid, whose flattering portrait shewn
" My eager hopes too fondly deem'd thine own,
N 2



" Her name, her fortunes, and her race declare, ^

" And while my sprites the nuptial feast prepare, &gt;

" Lead me, Miranda! to this unknown fair." j

Fixt on Miranda, scarce the king had view'd
That near the maid another damsel stood,
Till Marguerita dropt her veil, and shone
Bright as from clouds emerged, the silver moon, 590

As on the evening of the jousts array 'd
Her slender waist Marino's gift displayed.

" Alas!" he said, " my heart condemn'd to roam,
11 Still wanders on, nor ever finds a home;
" My fatal vow to thee my love denied,
" Or never had I sought an earthly bride." —

" Hear me! great king," the sweet Miranda said;
" Should'st thou some nymph of mortal lineage wed,
" Torn from the scenes to youthful memory dear,
" Not pomp and power her lonely heart could cheer: 600
" Soon inward grief would dim the radiant charms
" That wak'd thy love, and tear her from thine arms.



" A nymph to wed, thy solemn vow denies,

" But favouring fate a middle course supplies;

" Fair Marguerita, whom in years of yore

" To brave Titanos young Ostrea bore,

" Alike from ocean and from earth her race,

" And blest with every charm a throne to grace."

'Twere needless now to tell the king's reply,
Or paint in every breast the rising joy, 6 10

The assembled peers, who view'd the happy scene,
On bended knees salute their future queen;
When thro' the crowd the rescued Alfred sprung,
And thanks and greetings trembled on his tongue;
While youthful Henry follow'd, to require
A guide to lead them to the realms of fire.
But till the morn the king commands their stay;
The knights, tho' loth, the monarch's will obey.

The lute's soft sound, the trump, and mellow horn,
And songs of pleasure rous'd the lingering morn; 6'20
What splendid scenes unfolded to the sight
The soft effulgence of its emerald light!
The monarch's hall, of shells and coral rais'd,
With pearl and gold and gems unnumber'd blaz'd.
N 3



The waves in lofty columns rose, and round

Their shining shafts were wreaths of sea-flowers bound;

Beneath, of lords and dames a splendid throng,

To grace their sovereign's marriage, mov'd along.

The rites perform'd, the trumpet's warlike sound

Cali'd to the tournament each knight renown'd. 630

To grace the barriers, on a lofty throne ~^

Marino sate; his queen beside him shone, V

A snow-white lotus form'd her simple crown. j

Near her was fair Miranda placed; no more

Her looks or garb the stain of sorrow bore,

But rob'd in white, all smiling and serene,

She sate conspicuous in the splendid scene •

The Veil, the fatal cause of fear and pain,

So long remov'd, so oft deplor'd in vain,

Flow'd from her head in many a graceful fold, 640

And gave new beauty to her locks of gold.

Around were ocean's fairest nymphs; but there

Could none with her, or with their queen compare.

Yet many a youth that to the tourney came,

With eager looks had sought one absent dame,

And marvelled why Lymnoria, fair and gay,

Still prompt to haste where pleasure led the way,



Who lov'd the ocean's fairest maids among
To shine distinguished in the glittering throng,
To mark each jealous damsel's smother' d sighs 6.50

Burst as they watch'd their lover's wandering eyes,
When, like an empress, mid her slaves she shone,
And deem'd each eye should fix on her alone;
Why only she now shunn'd the festive scene,
Where all were met in honour of their queen.
Yet many a nymph the secret reason guest,
In looks, and signs, and whispers half exprest,
And marvelled much how envy found a place
In that fair breast, and love-inspiring face 
And some, whose minds a kindred thought conceal'd, 660
In specious guise their lurking envy veil'd:
" Twas true their queen was gracious, good and fair,
" Yet other nymphs might with her charms compare;
" And it was hard, must be by all confest,
" To see one nymph thus rais'd o'er all the rest,
" And more for her, once destin'd for the throne,
" Who deem'd this damsel but usurp'd her crown."
While some their queen's superior charms allow,
But mutter something of a broken vow,
N 4



Yet most their sovereign's act and choice approv'd, 670 ^
For Marguerita, wheresoe'er she mov'd, V

Was still by all esteem'd, admir'd and lov'd. J

The gallant pair, who sought the realms of fire,
Now from the king again a guide require,
Who oft, with graceful earnestness, deplor'd
The cause that forc'd them from his bridal board.
Yet well he knew it could not brook delay,
And tho' he wish'd, he would not urge their stay.
But his fair bride her suit unyielding prest,
On fair Miranda to remain their guest: 680

" III fitting your soft sex and tender frame
" Are earth's dark caverns, or the land of flame;
" Tir'd with the labours of our dangerous way,
" Not I, but prudence, now command your stay;
" Yet small would be my bridal joys, unshar'd
" By her whose prayers the way to bliss prepar'd;
" And ere their fmish'd quests the knights restore,
" My bark shall waft you back to Albion's shore.'*

Miranda yielded to the queen's request,
Their grateful thanks the parting knights exprest; 690



hOOK iv. THE SEA. 185

On either youth the king bestows a steed

For swiftness fam'd o'er all of ocean breed,

To both his hand with princely grace extends,

And as their guide the noble Clydon sends.

To each the queen a scarf pellucid gave,

That stole its azure tincture from the wave,

So bright it shone, its soft and silky fold

Was like a wave around their armour roll'd;

" This scarf," she said, " shall bid the flames retire,

" And guard you safe amid surrounding fire; 700

" Oh! may success on all your steps attend,

" And your long labours find a happy end!

" And when his richest blessings Fortune showers,

" And Love and Glory brighten all your hours,

" Still let this gift, if chance it meet your view,

" The memory of an absent friend renew."

The knights already mounted for their way;
T' announce the jousts the warning clarions play;
When in the lists a stranger knight was seen
Of towering stature, and of noble mien, 710

Unknown to all his arms or steed: his shield
A dolphin bore upon an azure field,



To ocean's knights and dames he seem'd, as one

By none remember'd, yet unknown to none.

Surpriz'd, awhile the parting knights attend,

The heralds now their martial call suspend.

Swiftly he rode around the silent ring

And paid his graceful homage to the king;

" My liege," he said, " ere yet the jousts commence,

" Or these brave knights begin their journey hence, 720

" Hear me! within this circle stands a knight,

" Whom I have sworn to meet in deadly fight,

" Before my prince, and all his peers, to prove

" False to his honour and his lady's love;

" Forlorn, deserted, in her lonely bower,

" Her weeping eyes the faithless youth deplore;

" He flies, the champion of another dame

" Who wins your favour in a borrow'd name;

" Him I defy, and in your royal sight,

" Will prove unworthy of the name of knight!" 730

The monarch's cheek, where deeper crimson glow'd
As spoke the stranger knight, his anger shew'd:
" Long have our ocean-peers the praise obtained
" Of dauntless valour, and of faith unstained,



I



mook iv. THE SEA.

" And much we grieve a warrior should disgrace

" Himself, his knighthood, and his noble race.

" Knight of the Dolphin, here his name declare!

" Tho' high his rank, and as a brother dear,

" That name this instant from our heart we tear; j

" And tho' to mirth we vow'd this festive hour, 740

" Nor wish'd that blood should stain our nuptial bower,

" He whom thy voice announces I command

" Here in the lists to meet thee hand to hand."



Incens'd, the monarch spoke; the knight unknown
ft Alfred!" proclaim'd, and flung his gauntlet down.
Amazement chill'd the youth accus'd; the maid
In changing hues surprize and fear betray 'd;
In wondering silence sate the bride and king,
While " Alfred!" echo'd from the astonish'd ring;
At length Marino spoke: " The tale you bear 750

" Is strange, and most unwelcome to our ear;
" Still let me hope some mystery clouds your sight,
" And while you combat, heaven defend the right!"

The queen meanwhile the sad Miranda cheers,
11 Alfred is true, then why these causeless fears?



188 THE SEA. book iv.

" His heart is brave, then in his valour trust!

" Just is his cause, and heaven protects the just!"

Impatient Henry mourns the impending fray,
Griev'd such a charge should thus their course delay,
While Alfred snatch'd the gauntlet from the ground, 760
And rode in haste the listed circle round,
" Come on," he cried; " 'tis false! my sword shall shame
" Thy recreant heart, and vindicate my fame."

The signal given, they ran, but stood the stroke,
And in their hands the faithless lances broke;
They seize their swords, but ward the blows so well,
That guiltless yet is either gleaming steel;
At length the Dolphin knight directs a blow
Which pierc'd the steed, but miss'd his wary foe:
It fell, though slight the wound! — The warrior stands 770
Recover'd, and on foot the fight demands.
While struggling on the ground, the horse betray'd
The fatal poison of the envenom'd blade;
The knights alone pursu'd the fight, nor heed
The clamorous circle, or expiring steed.



" The conflict cease!" exclaim'd the king; " the fight

" Enough has clear'd the fame of Albion's knight;

" And on yon stain to knighthood's noble name

" Has fix'd the mark of infamy and shame,

" Just guerdon of the coward, who in strife 780

** Assails with poison'd arms his foeman's life!"

The Dolphin warrior in amazement stood,
And now the steed, and now the falchion view'd;
The crowd pour on, ungovern'd in their rage,
And as a dog with pelting stones engage;
He rais'd his burnish'd helm — a face appears
By all remember'd, tho' unseen for years!
Fresh wonder staid the throng, disgrace and shame
Could never mingle with Delphino's name.
" Hear me, oh king! and by that honour gain'd 790

" In many a dangerous field, and yet unstain'd,
" My fame shall from this ordeal rise more bright,
" Or hence I fly self-banish'd from your sight!

" Thrice have the seasons chang'd, and thrice renew'd,
u Since at your royal side in fight 1 stood;
" The Gnomes before us fled — their artful flight
" Too far I follow'd in the heat of fight.



190 THE SEA. book iv.

" Thro' ways unknown escaped the dastard foe,

" I sunk into a pit that yawn'd below;

" By walls of firm basalt, secur'd and chain'd, 800

" For three long years in darkness I remaiu'd.

" A salamander heard rny moan; his aid

" Thro' the firm rock at length my passage made.

" This morn my native realm, and light of day,
" Again I view'd rejoicing; on my way
" I met a nymph: with many a streaming tear,
" Her lips the tale of wrongs and woe declare,
" And ask'd my aid. To day, she said, the king
" Graced with his bride the tourney's crowded ring.
" Her faithless knight alone, whose artful dame 810

" The court amus'd beneath a borrow'd name,
" Bound on a feign'd adventure, shunn'd the fray —
" My sword avenging must compel his stay,
" On this disloyal wretch her wrongs requite,
" And shame the dastard heart that fled the fight.
" She told his name and arms, and bade me speed;
" Unarm'd I stood; she gave these arms and steed,
"- I staid not till I reach'd this fatal place,
" And thought to meet with honour, not disgrace."



book iv. THE SEA. 191

" Disgrace/' the king exclaim'd, " on her alone! 820
" Come to my arms, thou bulwark of my throne.
" O! lost so long, so long as dead deplor'd!
" And now, upon this happy day restor'd — 
" But say, what sister of the briny wave
" To thee those arms and poison'd weapon gave?"

" Three weary years," Delphino said, " have past
" Siuce, in your court, I saw Lymnoria last,
" The stranger damsel veil'd her face with care,
" But seem'd Lymnoria in her form and air."

" Seek her! be swift!" the indignant monarch said, 830
Who not till then had miss'd the once lov'd maid.
Meanwhile a nymph, who breathless long had hung
On every accent of Delphino's tongue,
When now she found his honour freed from stain,
Love's fervent impulse could no more restrain,
She ran, — and, clasp'd with transport to his breast,
Her tears of joy bedew'd his silken vest.
Three years in sable weeds she mourn' d the knight,
And the same robes of pure and spotless white
Her queen that welcomed, greet the youth restor'd, 840
And grace her own, aud sovereign's bridal board.



But now Lymnoria came! her guilt was known;
Scornful she stood, nor would the crime disown.
" Great is our sorrow," said the king, " to find
" That lovely form bely so foul a mind:
" Thy arts our gentle suppliants to delay,
" The rocks and monsters that oppos'd their way,
" This maid by fraud deluded to thy cave —
" Unnotic'd all, our clemency forgave;
" But this rash act, which menac'd with disgrace, 850
" Not one brave knight alone, but all our race;
" Which, had not heaven forbade the hateful deed,
" And sav'd brave Alfred by his dying steed,
" Had lost a champion to his country dear,
" And drawn from beauty's eyes the bitter tear, —
" This wakes our sleeping wrath, our mercy shown
" Rebukes, and calls our deepest vengeance down.

" While countless years their course unvaried roll
" In those drear seas that bathe the Antarctic pole,
" On sheets of ice where powerless sunbeams play, 860
" And fogs eternal mock the frustrate ray;
" Where man has never yet presum'd, nor dare
" The spirits of the deep to venture there:



" That is thy home! in fro/en solitude,

" There cleanse thy heart in deepest guilt embued."

With tears and prayers, and every suppliant art,
The nymph too late assails Marino's heart;
Mirauda, Marguerita, knelt in vain;
The doom pronounced, unalter'd must remain.
Perhaps Lymnoria hoped her tears might move 8/0

In him some feeling of forgotten love,
Or if condemned, the magic of her eyes
In her defence would bid his warriors rise.
But, no! — if love rebellion dared suggest,
Reason subdued the thought, or shame supprest;
While those who late her lightest word obeyed,
Now turn'd indignant from the guilty maid:
And what of pity in his alter'd tone
Marino shew'd, appear'd in that alone.
Yet long and keenly smarts the rankling wound, 880

When those admir'd and lov'd are worthless found,
And truth's broad mirror, with a thousand flaws,
Obscures the spotless image memory draws.

As if indignant aught had power to bind
To transient homage her unyielding mind,



Lymnoria rose, and proudly moved along;

Two aged warriors led her thro' the throng:

No late repentance in her eye was seen, ^

Her doom she reck'd not, strode with haughty mien, V

And her last look glanc'd scorn upon her queen. 890*

The emerald sun now verging to the west,
The impatient warriors hastened on their quest;
Past were the hours design'd for martial sport,
A spacious hall receiv'd the glittering court,
And with their peers, the sovereigns laid aside
The cold restraints of state and regal pride;
Mirth at the table sate, a welcome guest,
And darkness clos'd unmark'd upon the feast.
When lo! on every side, a sudden light
From lamps unnumber'd burst upon the sight, 900

While echoing from a thousand fairy bowers,
The merry dance prolong'd the evening hours.
The ships above that skimm'd the sparkling tide
The unwonted sight with sudden fear descried,
Yet the soft beams and twinkling rays admire,
And deem the bosom of the deep on fire:



And as the stately notes of triumph swell,

Or sprightlier tones inspire the sounding shell,

While the clear waves the dulcet strains prolong,

They muse what syrens wake the midnight song. 910

BOOK THE FIFTH.



STROMBOLI.

The Nymphs, meanwhile, upon the ocean side,
Still watch'd the lessening vessel o'er the tide;
When, wafted by a thousand Sylphs that fling-
Arabian perfumes from each filmy wing,
Behold, in all his glory, Ariel come,
To guide Maria to the haughty Gnome.
Concentred sunbeams form'd his radiant throne,
His car refulgent as a meteor shone
Along the ethereal way; but brighter far
Was he who sat in that celestial car.
o 4



Unfading flowers his golden ringlets bound,

His regal brow a starry circlet crown'd;

Bright glow'd his wings with every varying hue,

His waving mantle caught the ethereal blue;

And never rose, in opening bloom array'd,

Such tints as Ariel's glowing cheeks display'd;

Nor could the sapphire's azure lustre vie

With the soft light of his benignant eye.

His sterner warriors round, in martial sport,

Mix with the lighter spirits of his court: 20

The brisk Electron grasps his lightning spear,

Keraunos moves the thunderbolt of war;

And mighty Bronte, whose tremendous roar

Fills the vast caves of Erie's rocky shore,

While loud contending o'er his foaming flood

With spirits of the mountain and the wood;*

There in mid ether, o'er the monarch's head,

His cloudy veil gigantic Nephos spread;

Whence on the gladden'd earth kind Ombra pours

The grateful moisture of descending showers. 30

Bright Actin lends his ray, and Iris flies,

And with her arch of beauty spans the skies.

* Lake Erie, in North America, is said to be particularly troubled with
storms of thunder and lightning. One of its bays is called Thunder Bay.



Thence dread Thuella pours her raging flood,
Sweeps o'er the earth, and rends the lofty wood;
Her form transparent, half dissolv'd in air,
Here gentle Drosa sheds the glistening tear.
Here moves in blameless freedom every wind,
That fabling Greece to bags and caves confin'd.
Some to the earth rude blasts and tempests bring,
Some shake refreshing moisture from their wing,
Some genial warmth and fragrant incense bear,
And aid the progress of the ripening year.

But now the ethereal fabric touch'd the ground,
While strains of heavenly sweetness breath'd around;
Such strains as floating o'er the Eoiian lyre,
The zephyrs bland at evening's close respire.
Soft on her ear the dulcet accents fall,
That to the radiant car Maria call,
That car which thro' the trackless wilds of air
To Sweden's distant strand the Nymph shall bear.
But ere she mounts, she craves the monarch's aid
Upon her course to speed the Iberian maid.

The king consents; the Sylphs his mandate hear,
And at his bidding frame a concave sphere.

Clear and pellucid was its texture rare,

And scarce distinguish'd from the ambient air,

Save by the hues of light that rise and fade,

And ever varying on its surface play'd,

And made it now like floating sapphire seem,

And now betray the topaz' golden gleam; 60

Now sparkle with the ruby's fiery red,

And now the emerald's cooler lustre shed.

Like clouds in Phoebus' setting rays that glow,

Appear'd the airy car that hung below.

It open'd, and a crystal throne display'd —

She mounts: the closing clouds conceal the maid.

Yet thro' the lucid skreen her eyes survey

All the long wonders of the various way,

As high it floats, o'er many a sea and land,

To flaming Stromboli's volcanic strand; 70

While wondering mortals mus'd what partial blast

Could make that little speck proceed so fast,

When all the clouds with easy motion sail,

On the smooth bosom of the vernal gale.

others, were formerly strong and frequent: it is now only remarkable for a
great column of sulphureous vapour rising from the crater. Sulphureous va-
pours also abound in every part of the island, and the soil is hot and filled
with clods of sulphur. The fumes were much greater in quantity in former
tjmes.

* In the description of Stromboli, and of the descents of Leonora and Alon-
zo, the account of Spallanzani is chiefly followed. Stromboli is perhaps the
most extraordinary of volcanoes. The island is entirely composed of streams
of lava, that, from their direction, have evidently flowed from a crater at
the top of the mountain, which is still remaining, but the time of its extinction
is unknown. The present crater is about half way up the mountain. Strom-
boli does not, like other volcanoes, rage onl v at intervals, but appears, from the
earliest times, to have been in unremitted action, yet no lava has ever flowed
from the present crater. Strabo and others speak of the brightness of the
eruptions, and Diodorus notices their constancy.

t The coast of Stromboli is covered to the east and north-east with a black
shining sand, which extends to some distance into the sea. It arises from the
scoriaceous lava ejected by the mountain, which is very friable and soon be-
comes pulverized. — Spallanzani.

Though each explosion shook the trembling cot; 140

And oft the scorize dark or fiery balls

Pour like a hail-storm on the shattered walls,

Or in his little vineyard, and consume

Its slumbering fury wake and rage anew.

The flaming masses rise above her head,

Descending now, she reach'd a rocky height,
Whence the whole scene unfolded to her sight;
Saw from the gulf the orbs of lava rise,
And clouds of dusky vapour veil the skies,
And shuddering thought how soon the hour might came.
When that red void should be her hated home;
That was her road, and from that sad sojourn,
Pyros or Fate might bar the hoped return,
Yet livelier thoughts her ardent bosom swell'd, 210

And love and hope her rapid steps impell'd;

Above the gulf she mark'd a narrow cave, #

A hanging rock the needful shelter gave;

She seized a favouring moment, then in haste

Dismiss'd her wondering guide, and safely past;

Above her head the balls ignited pour;

But safely shelter'd from the dreadful shower,

Within the pit she view'd the burning mass,

Of dark red hue, it gleam'd like melted brass,f

Now sunk, now rose; now gaseous floods impel 220

The fluid balls that harden'd ere they fell,

And down the cliff rush'd rattling to the main,

Dash'd on the rocks, or sought the abyss again.

Awhile she paus'd: " Oh thou! resplendent queen,
" Chief of the powers that rule this awful scene,
" Hear, from thy throne of fire, a suppliant maid,
" Propitious hear, and grant thy promis'd aid.
" Thy arm, Spinthera, thine alone can guide
" My steps in safety thro' yon boiling tide,

* This cave is described by Spallanzani as having sheltered him from the
ejections of the mountain, during his observations on the interior of the
crater.

t This is the appearance of the interior of the crater, as described by Spal-
lanzani; but succeeding travellers have doubted whether, from his situation
in the cave, he could possibly have seen the boiling lava. They imagine,
that his sight must have been deceived by the vapours in the crater.

Within the crater, nor again aspires;
But from the numerous caves that yawn'd around,
The smoke rush'd furious with a deafening sound,
And round the edge their vivid flames that play'd,
Had scar'd all other but this love-fraught maid; #

* This phenomenon is mentioned by Spallanzani, as having occurred
during one of his visits to Stromboli, and at first alarmed him considerably.
The natives described it as being very rare, and never of long continuance



" Then in my sovereign's care and mine confide,
" Plunge boldly in, nor dread the fiery tide."

The lava press, yet scarcely feel its heat;
O'er solid fire proceeds the undaunted dame,
And breathes amid an atmosphere of flame,
Which round her form, by frequent currents driven,
Fann'd her dark tresses like the gales of heaven.
Yet oft, at first, she screen'd her dazzled sight
From the full spehdour of that crimson light,
And shrunk from flames that round innocuous fly,
Soft as the evening zephyr's vernal sigh.

Warm with benignant heat the incumbent earth,
Arous'd the slumbering seed, and bid it shoot
Deep in the fostering soil its vigorous root,
While high in air the leafy stems ascend,
And clustering fruits in vermil pride depend;
Some bid beneath the exhaustless sulphur boil,
Whose fumes condensing in Vulcano's soil,

Bid chalk the marble's sparry texture wear;

Some the fall'n woods, by earth long cover'd o'er,

With fumes sulphureous fill at every pore,

Bid dark bitumen now pervade the whole,

And change the forest's leafy pride to coal,J



* Vulcano has in all ages been remarkable for the immense volumes of
sulphureous vapour arising in various parts of the island, and in particular
from the crater. The soil is in many places so impregnated with them,- that
on turning it slightly over, large clods of sulphur are found, These were
formerly a great article of traffic, but in consequence of the heat of the
ground the search is now abandoned, though the sulphur continues as plen-
tiful as formerly. Sulphur is a great agent in the decomposition of lava,
which, when exposed to its vapours, becomes soft, is covered by a white crust,
and gradually crumbles away.

t Sir James Hall made many experiments to ascertain the effect of heat
on bodies secured from the access of air, and under considerable pressure.
In these circumstances, he found that chalk assumed the crystallized appear-
ance of white marble, and that several of the earths were converted into

X However extraordinary it may appear, recent observations seem com-
pletely to establish the vegetable origin of coal. That immense forests
should suddenly have been overwhelmed, and, by the action of sulphureous
and bituminous vapours permeating their centre, have become completely
mineralized, is less wonderful than that succeeding and again succeeding
forests should have sprung and flourished on the site of their buried ances-
tors, and at last have shared their fate. Yet such is the scene exhibited by
the numerous subjacent strata of our coalmines.

* These medusas are found in great numbers in the Streights of Messinu
and occasionally in the seas which surround the Eolian Isles. The Abbe"
Spallanzaui has given a very long account of them in the fourth volume of his
Travels in the Two Sicilies. He says that the}' shine like a torch, and that
their light is visfble to the distance of some hundred paces. It is also visible
when they are thirty -five feet below the water. The light is variable, and
appears to depend on the motion of the animal. Sometimes it continues for
a quarter of an hour or longer, at others it becomes suddenly extinct, and
re-appears after a considerable interval.

Many species of medusa? possess this power of phosphorescence, particu-
larly the medusa scintillans of Mr. Macartney, and they seem to be the most
frequent cause of the luminous appearance of the sea during the night, in our
own as well as in other latitudes. The largest and most splendid of these
animals is the medusa pellucens, discovered by Sir Joseph Banks in the pas-
sage from Madeira to Rio de Janeiro, in the first voyage of Captain Cook.
It was taken from the sea at the same time with a minute species of crab
(the cancer fulgens), also luminous. This medusa measures six inches across
the crown, or umbella, which is marked by a number of opaque lines that
pass off from the centre to the circumference. It throws out flashes of light
during its contractions, which are so vivid as to affect the sight of the be-
holders. Ten or twelve of these flashes were generally visible at a time.
When the water containing these animals, and some of the cancer fulgens,
was emptied out of the bucket, it appeared like a stream of fire or melted gold.
The light of the medusae always decays and vanishes on the rising of the

The Castle on a rock enormous stood,
Which rose abruptly from the roaring flood;
Of herbage bare, save where the opuntia green
Had forc'd its stem the solid rocks between,
Careless of soil, with equal strength it grows
In the moist valley, or on mountain brows,
Where scarce the lichen hides the lava bare,
And seems to draw its sustenance from air; #
Its trunk of aggregated leaves was made,
Its verdant head a leafy crown display 'd:
Broad spread the leaves, and on their pulpy green
The embryo plants in bristled knobs were seen;



* The cactus opuntia, or cactus indicus, the Indian fig, is a very curiout
plant. It appears perfectly indifferent as to soil, if the climate be but suf-
ficiently warm. The stem is formed of a number of articulated divisions
growing upon one another, and commonly separated by so deep a contrac-
tion, as to have the appearance rather of distinct individuals than of parts of
the same plant. Hence these plants are called proliferous. In the species
of opuntia described in the poem, the joints swell in the older plants, and
acquire an equal thickness with the rest of the stem. The divisions are about
a foot long, eight inches broad, green, pulpy, rounded at the edges, and nar-
row at the stem, and have so much the appearance of leaves, as to be com-
monly, though not properly, so called. Qn these, when young, are found a
number of little knobs, which afterwards swell and become covered with
bristles. They contain the rudiments of future divisions. At the edges of
the divisions grow the flowers, which in some species are scarlet, but in this
yellow, and produce a fruit nearly of their own colour, of delicious flavour,
and a principal article of food with the natives of Stromboli and the otbef
Vulcanian isles.

Which rose in rugged grandeur on the sight,



* Campo Bianco, or the White Field, is one of the principal mountains of
Lipari. It is an aggregate of pumice-balls, and has all the appearance of
snow; whence its name. The pumices of Campo Bianco are a principal ar-
ticle of commerce with the Liparese. They cut them in large oblong
blocks, which are piled on the shore to await the arrival of vessels that con-
vey them to various parts of Europe.

Monte Castagna is a mountain composed entirely of volcanic glass or opsi-
dian, and has the appearance of a vast river suddenly congealed. These
two mountains are perhaps the most wonderful trophies of the power of vol-
canic fire in the world. In some parts of Iceland, portions of opsidian are
found, but no where is there any thing that can be compared with Cas-
tagna. The activity of the fire that formed the island of Lipari must have
been very great There are no traces of either pumice or glass in any other
of the Vulcanian isles, or among the lavas of Etna and Vesuvius. Perhaps
Santori, in the archipelago, is the only island that vies with Lipari in its
pumices. — Spallanzani.

t St. Angelo is the highest mountain in Lipari, and its dark and rugged
steeps, only interspersed by a few cultivated spots, form a striking contrast
to its neighbour and rival Monte Guardia, whose sides are covered with vines
and verdure. This difference in the two mountains arises from the difference
of the lavas which compose them. Those of Monte Guardia have been de-
compounded and rendered fertile by the action of the atmosphere and the
labour of man, while those of St. Angelo have hitherto resisted both. —

* The grape producing the celebrated malmsey of Lipari is large, and of
a bright amber hue. It is chiefly grown in Lipari, particularly on the side
of Monte Guardia, but a few vines are reared in Vulcano, and some other
of the Lipari isles. The vintage is to the natives a season of festivity. They
leave their dwellings on the shore and repair to cottages on the mountain,
and the lights from them have an unexpected and very pleasing appearance
to the voyager during the night. Malmsey and pumice are the only exports
of Lipari. — Spallanzani.

* The seas surrounding the Eolian isles are peculiarly liable to storms, and
often without any apparent cause. It is probably from this circumstance,
and from the violence and fluctuation of the winds, that they derived their
name, and that the ancients there fixed the dwelling of Eolus. There is a
celebrated cavern in Vulcano, called the cave of the winds, whence a con-
siderable blast still issues.

the felucca which conveyed him from Lipari to Stromboli.

t The sword-fish, xiphias ensis of Linnseus, pass in large shoals twice a year
through the Streights of Messina, where there is a considerable fishery for
them. From the beginning of April to the middle of June they pass to the
Genoese seas, where they propagate. From July to September they return
by the Sicilian side of the Streights of Messina, where the fishery is then
carried on.

*The Fata, or Fairy, Morgana, supposed by the inhabitants to be the cause
of a singular and beautiful phenomenon sometimes seen in the Faro of Mes-
sina. It occurs at the time when the sun surmounts the eastern hills behind
Reggio, and rises high enough to form an angle of forty-five degrees on the
water before the city, which at these times is smooth and glassy. The spec-
tator standing with his back to the sun, on a sudden beholds in the water
numberless series of pilasters, arches, castles, towers, magnificent palaces,
groves of trees, plains covered with herds and flocks, armies of men, on foot
and on horseback, &amp;c. &amp;c. in their natural colours, passing rapidly in suc-
cession along the surface of the sea.

Sometimes, if the air be slightly hazy, these objects are surrounded with
prismatic fringes; and sometimes, when the atmosphere is highly impregna-
ted with vapour, the objects observed on the water are repeated, though more
faintly, at a considerable height in the air.

These images appear to be merely the multiplied reflexions of objects on
shore. They probably, like the rainbow, owe their origin to the adverse sun,
aided by very peculiar circumstances in the atmosphere; and like it, are pre-
cisely the same to no two spectators. A curious appearance is sometimes
observable on Alpine heights. A company of adventurers ascending the
brow of a mountain, with their backs to the rising sun, each person perceives,
on a frozen cloud before him, his own shadow, but not that of any of his com-
panions; its head crowned with a glory, and surrounded by various concen-
tric rainbows. During the dense fogs which obumbrated London in January,
1814, many persons walking in the streets, and unable to distinguish their
neighbours, were thus surprised by the company of their own shadows
which started up at their sides as they past the lamps. All these phenome-
na appear to have a similar origin, but they are not sufficiently frequent for
much investigation.

(t Oh! aid my progress here!" Alonzo cried.

He spoke; a sudden gale refresh 'd the air,

And mighty Boreas hasten'd at his pray'r;

Not as to Albion Arctic blasts he brings,

And second winter on his icy wings;



* When the scirocco, or south-east wind prevails, Stromboli is covered by
a great cloud of lurid smoke, impervious to the sun, except at the very edges,
which are white. This cloud, composed of hot sulphureous vapours, often
extends half way down the mountain, and a mile above it, and renders the
ascent impracticable. During the north, or north-west wind, this cloud va-
nishes almost entirely, and the mountain may be ascended with safety.

Here the mild breezes own his gentle reign,

And waft Apulian fragrance o'er the main,

At distance fell Scirocco seem'd to know, 460

And with instinctive terror shuns his foe;

He spreads his tawny wings— he scours the plain,

And seeks Sahara's boundless wilds again.

Kapnos awhile delay'd, then rising high,

Spread his gigantic form and vanish'd in the sky;

Again the sun his orb unclouded shew'd,

Alonzo hasten'd on his dangerous road,

And reach'd the fiery gulf: a numerous band

Of sprites around in hostile phalanx stand;

In vain he states what wondrous causes bring 470

A mortal knight a suppliant to their king,

And prays their courtesy to guide him right —

With levell'd spears the train provoke the fight;

While Spintheros his arrows showers from far,

The gallant Phlogos hastes to closer war.

Short was the strife — what mortal could withstand

The fierce attack of his unconquer'd hand!

The knight invokes celestial aid in vain;

His weary arms the faulchion scarce sustain;

When Phlogos now, who saw his strength decay, 480

Seized in his arms his unresisting prey;



hook v. STROMBOLI. 22r

Faint with the heat, exhausted with the fight,
He hung a lifeless burthen on the sprite,
Who, while his comrade follow'd, swiftly bore
His victim to the inhospitable shore.

" But whence," he cried, " and who this knightly pair
" That treads these nether realms with dauntless air?
" At their approach the sprites in haste retire,
" And safe they move amid encircling fire!
" Stand knights! in death your trespass you atone, 4Q0
" Or win your dangerous passage with my own."

The summons soon obey'd, in deadly fight
The dauntless warriors clos'd with either sprite.
But Spintheros, in missile warfare skill'd,
(His arrows useless in the narrow field,)
Soon yields to Alfred's arm; his eye of fire,
And roseate bloom, in pallid death expire.

As turns the victor knight, amaz'd he found
Alonzo pale and senseless on the ground;
He rais'd his head — on Alfred's scarf-clad breast 500
His lifeless arms and throbbing temples rest.

The wondrous scarf exerts its cooling power,
Refreshing as at summer's sultry hour
To sunburnt pastures the reviving shower,
Or by the faint and weary traveller seen,
Mid Afric's sands her springs and isles of green.

Meanwhile, with Phlogos hand to hand engaged,
A long and doubtful conflict Henry waged;
While every blow the salamander dealt
On Henry's magic cincture dropt nnfelt;
And every stroke of Henry's vengeful blade
Deep iu his rival's mail a passage made.
The wounded Phlogos writh'd with rage and pain,
" But soon the ethereal essence clos'd again:"
Thus slightest shocks the limpid stream divide,
And o'er the wound thus flows the closing tide.
Vex'd at his fruitless toil, the knight unroll'd
His emerald scarf, and flung its silken fold
Full on the sprite — as bubbles on the wind
Burst as they sail, nor leave a trace behind,
He sunk, and where his arm the fight maintained,
No sign, no vestige, of the chief remained.

Alouzo now restor'd, uncheck'd they past,
And Pyros' regal palace reach'd at last.
Bright walls of fire the ample space enclose,
Here domes of smoke on flamy columns rose,
There smoky pillars wreaths resplendent bound,
And cornices of fire the roof surround.
While, like the vault of heaven, in dazzling light,
The scattered lamps adorn its fleecy white,
Light forms of fire the hall majestic fill,
And move obedient to their monarch's will;
Who by his beauteous bride, in awful state,
Rais'd on a throne of fiery splendour sate,
And round his graceful form such lustre plays,
That e'en the sprites are dazzled as they gaze.

Before them Leonora stood; her air
And mournful eye a fruitless suit declare,
In vain she strove by prayers her Veil to gain,
And mild Spinthera urg'd her lord in vain,

The monarch spoke; while, chafed with inward ire,
His nostrils breath'd, his eyeballs flash 'd with fire;
Brave Henry rais'd the visor from his brow,
And thus replied, in words sedate and slow:

" There was a time, in Salem's hallow'd land,
" That Pyros join'd Mohammed's impious band, 560
" There led the host that worship at his shrine,
" And powerful spells and magic fenc'd their line.
" The Sylphs and Europe's host their force defied,
" Triumphant fought, for heaven was on their side.
" 111 would it fit a warrior's tongue to tell
" Of vanquish'd foes that by his valour fell;

" And ill it fits a Christian knight to boast

" Of ruth and mercy to a conquer'd host;

" But when beneath a Christian warrior's sword,

" His vanquished votary call'd his distant lord, 570

" Then Pyros knows the arts he used to save, ^

" The prayers he urg'd, the royal word he gave, \

" And Henky comes the promis'd boon to crave." j

He spoke: at once the monarch's anger gone,
With milder mien he left his lofty throne,
Each wondering warrior hail'd with courteous grace,
And welcom'd Henry with a friend's embrace.

" Forgive, brave knight," he said, " thy name unknown,
" Our angry mien and strange reception shewn,
u Hail to these nether regions! and receive 580

" Such welcome as a grateful prince should give,
" And be thy boon of worth at once to prove
" Our friend's confiding mind, and Pyros' love."

" Such shall it be!" the generous knight rejoin'd,
" Not for myself I tax thy noble mind;

" If but thy vow resist," the youth replied,
" Still shalt thou yield, nor claim I ought beside,

" I will!" the king in eager transport said,

Wrapt in her rescu'd pledge, the Spanish maid 660
And joyful knight their grateful homage paid
To fair Spinthera, to the royal sprite,
To Alfred, and to Albion's generous knight.
Then as he twin'd it in her sable hair,
Alonzo recogniz'd, and claim'd his spear,
(That spear had prov'd a faithful staff, to guide
Her failing footsteps on the mountain side.)

The Veil restor'd, not long the knights delay'd,
Nor linger'd long the fair Iberian maid.
She bids farewell — in Chliarotes' care, 670

Thro' the deep gulf again she mounts to air.
And oh! how lovely to her wearied eye,
The moon's soft light, the azure of the sky,
The still and placid grandeur of the scene,
The haunts of man, the tufts of sober green,

And that red cloud, that in the blue expanse,

With rapid motion sailing, met her glance;

Is that her airy car? — with what delight

She watch'd it sinking from the ethereal height!

How softly seem'd the evening gale to breathe, 680

How calm the waves of ocean slept beneath!

While its fair freight the aerial vessel bore,

And safely lands on Albion's happy shore. 683

Lost in conjecture whence the wanderer strays;

And thro' ethereal realms their progress guide;J



* The subject of meteors and meteoric stones, and the numerous theories
respecting them have been considered in a note on the third Book, page 120.

t The rapidity with which light is transmitted is surpassed by nothing but
electricity, which in its passage along a very extended chain, always appears
to be in every part at the same instant. Whether light be a substance
or an action, has been often debated, yet never decided; but its extreme
swiftness cannot be better illustrated than by the simple fact, that the time in
which it passes from the sun to the earth, a distance of nearly one hundred
millions of miles, does not exceed eight minutes and a half.

% Light and heat though usually, are not inseparably, connected, which is
proved by the analysis of the ray by the prism. At the violet end of the
spectrum, scarcely any heat is perceptible; but it increases gradually towards
the red rays, and is strongest in certain invisible rays which extend beyond
them. In a similar way, the chemical effects produced by the beams of the

The quick vibrations of concentric sound.*

sun appear not to depend either on light or heat, but on a peculiar set of rays,
different though connected with them. Horn, silver, or any other body, whose
colour is changed or blackened by exposure to the sun, is scarcely affected by
the red rays, but changes more rapidly when it approaches the violet end of
the spectrum, and in certain invisible rays beyond them the effect is much
the strongest.

The nature of heat, whether ii be a substance or an action, a peculiar sub-
tle fluid that insinuates itself between the particles of bodies, and incites them
to repel each other, or merely a series of pulsations or undulations, received
arid transmitted by them, appears to be as little ascertained as the nature of
light, and the French and English chemists have, as usual, embraced opposite
sides of the question. — Davy and Brande.

* The nature of sound cannot be better illustrated than by throwing a
pebble into the water, and observing the concentric circles that immediately
begin to spread, and becoming wider and fainter, cease at a considerable dis-
tance. Sound consists of a number of vibrations transmitted by the particles
of air in concentric circles around the body which impels them. Denser bo-
dies convey sound better and more rapidly than air, for instance, water, ice,
the metals, &amp;c.

t The spirits presiding over electricity are here intended. The pheno-
mena of the Auroras Borealis and Australis are generally believed to be ow-
ing to the passage of electricity through the rare atmosphere of the poles.

% It has been supposed that oxygen is the chief agent in producing the

rivid hues of flowers, particularly the red tints. Its presence is necessary to
combustion and to respiration, which appear to be of the same nature, car-
bonic acid being the result of both. It was formerly believed that oxygen
entered into combination with the blood during respiration, and that it was
absorbed; but experiment has proved this opinion to be incorrect, and that
the whole of the oxygen, consumed in respiration, is employed in the forma-
tion of the carbonic acid evolved. It has been stated in a former note, that
oxygen, on entering into combination with a body, destroys its conducting
power; it is, therefore, said in the poem to obstruct the progress of electricity.
Davy, Brande,and Roget's Lectures.

* This alludes to the formation of water by the combination of oxygen and
hydrogen, or inflammable air. It is a curious circumstance, that water, the
greatest enemy to combustion, should be formed by the union of the greatest,
and till lately believed, the sole supporter of combustion, with a gas itself in-
flammable.

t The snow which fell last January, 1814, contained many beautiful little
flat feathery stars, having usually six points. The largest were about a quar-
ter of an iuch in diameter, but the size varied. Dr. Clarke in the first volume
of his travels states that, while he was at St. Petersburgh, the thermometer of
Celsius, being at 5° below the freezing point, with little or no wind, snow fell
for three hours in the most beautiful and regular crystals, each being about
the size of a split pea, and consisting of a star with six points. During this
time no other snow fell.

A similar phenomenon occurred at Cambridge on the 16th January,
1810, under precisely similar circumstances, and is recorded in the Cambridge
Chronicle. The stars were, if possible, more perfect than at Petersburgh.

Dr. Clarke has given a theory to account for this appearance, but he seems
not to have been aware that the crystallization of snow was not a new pheno-
menon, but had been observed by Descartes and Kepler. The first probable
theory of it was given by M. de Mairan, and is neatly illustrated by Dr. Hut-
ton in his Mathematical Recreations. The small needles of ice, which are
formed in the progress of congelation, are implanted one into the other in re-

ice meeting another, unites with it in an angle of 60° 5 four more are gradual-
ly added, and the simple star of sis points is formed. If new needles of ice
be added, they must place themselves on the first radii, either by making an
obtuse or an acute angle towards the centre. In the first case, the result will
be a star, the radii of which have a kind of barbs like a feather, or a star hav-
ing six salient and six re-entering angles. There are also some figures still
more complex, but these are rare.

Now o'er the black abyss the monarch bends,
And thro' the unmeasured depth his voice descends,
" A guide!" the king demands; his heavenly breath
Appear'd to burst the dreadful calm of death,
While echoing from the gulf and rocks around,
An hundred voices seem'd to join the sound.

And now, tho' faint and wan, a ray of light 60

Appears below, and breaks the dreary night.
It brightens, and a hideous Gnome appears,
Who thro' the gulf a bark ascending steers.
Less black was Vulcan, at his ceaseless toil
When Thetis found him in the Lemnian isle;
Less gloomy Charon seem'd when he convey 'd,
In his craz'd bark, the manes of the dead;
His wrinkled brow with soot was cover'd o'er,
His haggard cheeks a smile malignant wore;

Star'd wildly round, and seem'd to loath the ray;

One held a torch, and one the vessel steer'd.

At two small seats in silence points the guide,

" Descend!" the Gnome in voice of thunder said.
Sad on her ear those hollow accents came,
And thrill'd with horror all her shrinking frame.
From his dark form she turn'd her glistening eyes, 80

And fix'd them wildly on the azure skies.;
Still less and less the lucid circle grew,
Shrunk to a point, and vanish'd from her view.
While fainter as it shone, her eager sight
More keenly strain'd to catch the latest light,
And when it fled, with grief and fear opprest,
She droop'd, and hope forsook her aching breast.
" Alas!" she thought, " in that bright point, the skies
" And cheerful day for ever fled mine eyes;
" I go a living victim to the tomb, 90

" Where shapes terrific haunt congenial gloom;
" Far from those scenes which memory turns to trace,
" Each well known spot, each ' dear familiar face/

She casts upon the guide an anxious glance,
Then on the aerial monarch, to descry,

But now, with sudden cold, a dreadful sound
Of rushing streams and torrents roaring round,
Arous'd the maid, yet nought her eyes survey,*
The heavy air obscur'd the torch's ray
That faintly glimmer'd through the dashing spray.
But as the vessel sinks, the torrent's roar
Dies in the distance, and is heard no more,
While down the sad abyss, long, deep, and dark,
With added swiftness still descends the bark;
At length they reach the ground, Maria springs
From her frail seat, yet still to Ariel clings,
While through the narrow path of damp and gloom
Their steps are lighted by the sullen Gnome.

But now, what cheerful sounds and sudden light
Burst in full splendour on her dazzled sight!

Where silver columns the bright dome sustain;

Amid his court, upon a lofty throne,
In regal state, the sage Argyros shone,
An aged chief; an ample realm he swayed,
Revered for wisdom, and with joy obey'd;
Yet more he wish'd his loaded wains to bear
The gifts of commerce, than the spoils of war,
And better liked his temper'd fires to yield
The sculptur'd chalice, than the bossy shield;
Thro' crowded streets to urge his sumptuous cars,
Than ride triumphant o'er the field of Mars:
His word was truth, his wisdom high was deem'd,
And next to Chrysos was his worth esteem'd,
And many a doubtful cause, to him referr'd,
He judged impartial, as he calmly heard:



* A spacious hall surrounded by galleries is supported by columns of mine
silver, which reflect in every direction the lamps that illume this subterra-
nean region. A river passes along the centre of the hall; and the contrast

That told the mine's malignant demon near.*

Those fading flames attest his baleful breath,

Down sink the Gnomes, or fly the impending death,

Or stand prepared again in native night

The evil Spirit came — o'er Ariel's head,

A snowy film, his floating form, was spread;

Seiz'd the foul Sprite, and crush'd him in his hands;

Or, withering at his touch, unhappy fair!

Thy fears and hopes at once had ended there! —

Bright beam the lamps, the Gnomes recovered rise,

And all again is bustle, life, and noise.



* An attempt is here made to give an idea of the phenomenon called by
the miners Fire Damp. This is an explosion of hydrogen gas, which not un-
frequently takes place in mines where ventilation is not properly attended to,
and sometimes produces very fatal consequences. The hydrogen exhaling
from some neglected part of the mine, takes fire at the lamps of the work-
men, and produces a violent explosion, the effects of which are however less
dreadful than those of the air rushing in to supply its place. If the miners
have sufficient time, they endeavour to prevent the explosion by extinguish-
ing their lights, or fall on their faces to avoid the return of the blast. Some-
times they observe a white film floating over their heads, which they in-
stantly seize, and crush in their hands, to prevent its explosion. In mines
which are much troubled with hydrogen gas, the men are not allowed lamps,
but work by the light of a flint-mill, or of sparks struck from a wheel sur-
rounded with blades of iron, like that of a razor-grinder, and turned rapidly
round.

The wanderers quit these busy realms of light,
And plunge once more in silence aud in night; 170

Yet still from Ariel's crown the unfading ray
Supplied the absence of ethereal day.
Thro' many a cave and arched way they pass,
Hewn in primeval granite's solid mass,
In speckled porphyry, or in marble white,
Or glittering schist, or darker sienite,
And now directly in the adventurers' way,
Deep, wide, and swift a milky river lay;*
Awhile in thought the aerial monarch stood,
Prepar'd to bear the maiden o'er the flood, 180

But as the Sylph approach'd, the waters fled,
And dry they journey'd o'er its silver bed,
Then paus'd upon the bank, surpriz'd to view

• Rivers, where the soil is much impregnated with silver, have generally a
milky hue.

t Intermittent springs are not very frequent, but there are three or four
in England; the principal of which are those of Lay well, nearTorbay, and
of Buxton, in Derbyshire. In the former the water rises and falls twenty
times in succession, and afterwards flows uniformly for two hours. In that
of Buxton it intermits every quarter of an hour. But the most celebrated
of intermittent springs are in the lake of Tschirnitz, in Carniola. This lake
is about fourteen miles in length, and five in breadth. It is full of water
during the greater part of the year, but about the beginning of July the
•water runs off by eighteen subterranean conduits; the fish either escape with

Those veteran chiefs who oft had brav'd in fight

The hosts of fire, or bold Hydidae's might,

With slavish fear obey their tyrant lord,

Haste at his nod, and tremble at his word.

Chrysos alone, a keen reproachful glance

Darts on the king, more sharp than foeman's lance,

Heeds not his angry look, and dares to frown

On the pale Sprite that stands before the throne;

Kassiteros, whose servile tongue display'd 1

The wiles that lur'd the unsuspecting maid,

And faltering told the unexpected aid;

Which (while his towers immur'd, not her alone,

Whom to decoy those towers delusive shone,

But two fair maids, by spells congenial tied,)

His triumph mock'd, and made his labour void,

Releas'd the damsels, and the fort destroy'd.

Pleas'd with their counsels known, the king forgave

The fruitless toil, and smil'd upon his slave.

When first this nether realm Albruno sway'd,
His just commands a cheerful laud obey'd;
By Chrysos guided, every happy hour,
With blessings wing'd, bore record of his power,

His prosperous realm was free from war's alarms,

Or led by wisdom, glory crown'd his arms;

Hope gaz'd with transport on his dawning sway,

And blazon'd brighter still his noontide ray.

But ah! too soon the monarch's heart around

His serpent folds false Oreichalcon wound,

Rous'd by his breath, his heart alternate strove

With mad ambition and insensate love:

One bred protracted wars and countless foes,

One taught the fraud that caus'd Maria's woes;

While flattery clouded truth's serener rays,

And urged him to pursue their meteor blaze;

And tho', his favourite dead, again his ear

To Chrysos turn'd, with penitence sincere,

Returning virtue vainly fought with pride,

And love yet linger'd where ambition died.

Nor could the sage's prudent voice persuade

The stubborn monarch to release the maid;

" Tho' time yet lingers, soon the appointed hour

" Will place the beauteous virgin in my power,

" Then haste, ye Gnomes, and trim the bridal bower; J

" Let all that yields delight to eye or ear,

" Each pleasing tint, each soothing sound be there;

" All that on earth can female fancy warm;

" So shall my zeal the grateful damsel move,

" And wealth and splendour light the fires of love." Q50

Thus spoke Albruno, when the entering maid

Among his peers her fairy form display'd;

A lovelier nymph these regions ne'er had seen,

Of form more graceful, or more princely mien,

Tho' from her cheeks their wonted bloom was fled,

And chilling fear restrained her airy tread.

The chiefs around in silent rapture pause,

Or join the whisper'd murmur of applause.

Not so the king! for tho' in mute delight

On her lov'd form he fed his ravish'd sight, 260

When he beheld how dim, how sunk her eye,

How pale her cheek, and heard her long-drawn sigh,

His conscience woke, and to his tortur'd heart

Her scorpion stings their fiercest fury dart;

He trembled lest the assembled Gnomes should know

That he had caus'd such aggravated woe,

And at her bidding rise in rebel arms,

The prompt avengers of her injured charms,

" Alas!" she said, " what hate thy bosom bears,

Where indignation triumph'd over fear,

He pondered how to quench the rising flame,

To sooth her grief, yet not resign the dame;

When, long in craft, and wiles insidious tried,

The artful plan Kassiteros supplied,

And, as the damsel weeping left the hal),

Her faltering steps the monarch's words recall.

Fraudful he spoke, who deem'd securely chain' d,
His deepest cell the captive youth detain'd,
Nor thought, for one unknown, the bravest knight 3SO
Thro' Europe's realms would dare the unequal tight;
Or rashly should some chief the held demand,

He only sought, by seeming good betray'd,
From upper light to keep the hapless maid,
And hold her, when expir'd the fatal day,
Within his power an unresisting prey.

Maria, weeping, with her friend withdrew,
Nor found the prospect brighten on her view;
Fate seemed to draw a darker circle round, ^90

Her Henry lost, herself more firmly bound —
While Amiantha vainly strives to cheer
Her drooping heart, and dry the frequent tear;

When thro' the nether realms the sounding gong 400

Call'd to the lists Albruno's vassal throng.
A brilliant ring! yet many a blooming maid,
And aged matron, mourning robes array'd,
And oft the anxious eye look'd round in vain
For warriors sleeping on the battle plain.
Her hands to heaven uprais'd, in earnest prayer
Maria sate, and seem'd a statue fair;
Or, by her wreath of flowers and suppliant eyes,
Some victim drest for ancient sacrifice.
The hour-glass told the fatal moment near, 410

Its last sands ran, yet was not Henry there.
" Ah!" thought Maria, " whither dost thou rove,
" While instant danger threats thy distant love,

Prepared for fight, now proud Albruno came, 420

His diamond shield and ruby armour flame:
With him Kassiteros, in white array'd,
His stately step vain confidence betray'd;
Chrysos was last, and seem'd to loath the cause
That from its sheath his golden falchion draws.
The martial trio past the barriers bright, J

Where lamps depend in many an arch of light, &gt;

And thus the herald's voice announc'd the fight:
" Our lord, Albruno, of a race divine,
" Chief of the Gnomes, and Monarch of the Mine, 430
" Whom earth thro' all her realms obeys, and pours,
"At his command, her never-failing stores,
" Maria's suitor, cloth'd in temper'd mail,
" Now seeks her hand, affianc'd by the Veil,
" And comes prepared, before the beauteous dame,
" To fight with all who dare dispute his claim,
" With him Kassiteros and Chrysos stand,
" To prove his title to the maiden's hand;
" If any doubt his right, or dare deny,
" Now let them come, and here his arm defy; 440

" Before the maiden be their quarrel tried,
" Who wins the battle, wins the Veil and
" Bride,"

Twice was the summons given, no answer came,
.And a chill faintness seiz'd the maiden's frame;
Again in louder tone the herald cried,
" Prepare — we come!" a hollow voice replied.
Yet vainly search'd the anxious eye around,
No warrior entering, answered to the sound,
But like the troubled waters of the main,
The heaving earth now rose, now sunk again, 450

Now yawn'd a cavern, whence with hissing noise,
Sulphureous steams and azure flames arise,
Upsprung three knights — thus Cadmus saw the field,
His labour plough'd, an armed harvest yield.*
First Henry came, and on Maria threw
A cheerful glance, that wak'd her hopes anew,
And as the throng stand speechless with surprize,
To instant fight the astonish'd king defies.
While Alfred and Alonzo, gallant pair!
Firm on the closing ground the conflict dare. 460

All pause in wonder, but the most amaz'd,
Albruno stood, and mutter'd as he gaz'd.

" How comes he here?— by whom releas'd? — and how? —

" His treacherous guards — but 'tis no matter now,

" Success is sure, and when I end the fight,

" No common pangs their treason shall requite."

He turn'd — " Rash youth, and dost thou madly run

" To brave that arm which prudence bids thee shun?"

Aloud he cried — " then on, proud mortal, come,

" And from Albruno's sword receive thy doom, 470

" That fatal doom all rash intruders prove,

" Who vie with me in combat or in love."

No answer Henry deign'd — the trumpets blew,
And from their hands their beamy lances flew;
Guiltless they fell — in nearer fight oppos'd
They met — and now with Alfred Chrysos clos'd,
While mindful of his recent fall, with fear
Kassiteros beheld Alonzo near,
And fled — but as he ran the barriers round,
The spear, pursuing, pinn'd him to the ground. 480

He fell unpity'd, not a warrior there,
Or maid or matron, grae'd him with a tear:
But anger glow'd on many a veteran's face,
Griev'd for the wounded honour of their race;

And inly blamed their monarch's tardy blade,

And marvell'd at his vengeance thus delay'd.

Fierce was the fight; by love and hate inspir'd,

Warm'd by her presence whom they both desir'd;

Swift rush'd the tide of life thro' every vein,

They turn, they bend, and every sinew strain; 490

Their shiver'd spears bestrew'd the glittering sand,

Their threat'ning falchions beam'd in either hand;

Albruno's sword, the toil of many a year,

Hewn from the axis of this mundane sphere,

That adamantine prism, whose branches shoot

In all directions from their parent root,

And when he bids its smallest fibre shake,

The city falls, the solid mountains quake;*

Keen was its edge, embued in many a charm,

A weapon worthy of Albruno's arm. 500

By Ariel's hand was Henry's sword bestow'd,

The wondrous blade with fiery lustre glow'd;

nation, he commands this stone to give motion to one of its fibres, and an
earthquake instantly takes place.

The harden'd steel divides, and knotted oak,
Yet now in vain repeated blows assail,
A stronger charm secured Albruno's mail,*"
Each with unwearied strength attacks his foe,
Each stroke eludes, and blow returns for blow;
Fast from their batter'd mail the flashes fly,
The echoing caverns to the strokes reply.
Yet neither yields — and Chrysos unsubdued,
In dubious contest still with Alfred stood;
Now on the champion's head his sword descends,
The temper'd helm his threat'ned life defends,
Yet glancing down, the falchion pierc'd his side,
His burnish'd arms the crimson torrent dy'd:
Sunk on his knee, and senseless from the blow,
He seem'd an easy victim to his foe,
But brave Alonzo came, his massy shield
Received the stroke at Alfred's breast impell'd;
With vigour unimpair'd he wag'd the fight,
And with redoubled blows assails the Sprite.

Meanwhile recovered, gallant Alfred sought
The spot where Henry and Albruno fought,
A mighty blow the king at Henry sped,
Palsied his arm, his hand resign'd the blade,
But Alfred's ready sword the loss supplied,
Again the knight the angry Gnome defied:
Thus foil'd, whea victory seem'd secure, and cries
Of joy and triumph fill'd the nether skies,
Furious he turn'd, and shuun'd the former strife,
To glut his vengeful soul with Alfred's life.
Broke was the hero's spear- — his faithful brand,
His only weapon, shone in Henry's hand;
Yet on his breast he held his massy shield,
And slow retreated o'er the ensanguin'd field;
He came where, writhing with a mortal wound,
Kassiteros lay struggling on the ground;
Tho' lingering still, the spear forbade to rise,
And on the fight he turn'd his dying eyes,
Strain'd every nerve, and seiz'd with either hand
Brave Alfred's foot, and stretch'd him on the sand.
His crafty spirit at the effort fled —
Beneath the monarch's arm the champion laid,
His sword was lifted for the stroke of fate,
When Henry's falchion fell with deadly weight;

His broken mail his wounded shoulder shew'd,

But from die wound no crimson torrent flow'd.

" Turn, if thou dar'st," cried Henry, " coward Sprite!

" Or dar'st thou but with foes unarm'd the fight?" 550

Stung with the taunt, Albruno turn'd — his foe

Shunn'd with an agile bound the impending blow;

With strength unwearied, and increasing. rage,

In closer fight the valiant pair engage,

Now this, now that, retiring seems to yield;

Maria, trembling, eyed the doubtful field:

Thrice Henry's falchion pierc'd the monarch's side,

Albruno's twice in Henry's blood was dy'd;

In silent agony the Gnomes survey'd

The blow now hanging o'er their monarch's head, 560

And had his own good weapon arm'd the knight,

No more were needful to decide the fight.

The monarch bent beneath the mighty stroke;

In Henry's hand the faithless weapon broke;

Who, swift as eagles seize their prey, threw down .

The borrow'd falchion, and regain'd his own.

Prepar'd to meet the monarch's arm he stood,

Again they clos'd, again their fight renew'd.

Chrysos meanwhile still braved his angry foe,
And parries oft, but seldom aims a blow, 570

Still as he fought, increasing strength he gains,
The exhausted Spaniard scarce the fight sustains.
When now, where Albion shines amid the main,
The last faint sunbeam ting'd the watry plain,
By turns Maria watch'd the doubtful fight,
Or on the hour-glass fix'd her aching sight,
And saw, as flow'd the shallow sands away,
The jaws of ruin opening on their prey.
Now proud Albruno, mad that mortal knight
So long with him sustained a doubtful light, 580

Infuriate spoke: " Too long thy arts evade

" What spells secure thy mail? what powerful charm

" No mortal strength, unaided, could withstand
" The deadly weight of this immortal hand!
" Yet now receive thy due," — and as he spoke,
Full at his head he aim'd the dreadful stroke,
The wary youth the threat'ning blow repell'd,
Which spent its fury on his lifted shield; 590

From his stunn'd arm the orb divided flew —
Maria, trembling, sicken'd at the view,

As to the orphan sounds her parent's knell,

She saw her last faint hopes of conquest fail,

Her love defenceless, lost the fatal Veil,

Her sorrows wept, and bore herself a part;

Then first did maiden wish, in battle field,

To see her love before his rival yield. 600

Meanwhile the dauntless youth collects his might,

By one decisive blow to end the fight,

To win or die; and while the king addrest ~\

Then where thick plates of well-wrought brass unite

His ruby arms and sapphire cuirass bright,

He pierc'd Albruno's chest — no more avail

His vaunted valour, or impassive mail,

Swift to his heart the burning blade was thrust, 610

The haughty monarch sunk upon the dust;

For tho' immortal, yet of sense bereft,

His heart forgot to beat, his cheek the colour left.

Griev'd at the sad reverse, the astonish'd throng

In silence stood, when struck the mighty gong:

That solemn sound, which on Maria's ear,

That morning fell, in anguish and despair,

Which seem'd the knell of happiness to toll,

Slave to a haughty tyrant's Ioath'd controul,

Now told the setting sun, the finish'd fight, 620

The Veil redeem'd, and safe her victor knight.

With such sweet force the tide of rapture came,

Its sudden weight o'erwhelm'd her weary frame;

She sunk; but pleasure soon her eye relumed,

And her wan face a livelier hue assumed.

Albruno too revived — the languid tide

Again more briskly swell'd his veins, and dyed

His sallow cheek, but as he slowly rose,

A sullen shame his gloomy looks disclose.

" Come! '; to the champions and the maid he cries, 630

With stifled anger, " take the Veil, your prize!

" Retire, ye Gnomes 5 no sprite of Gnomian race

" Shall view his monarch in this dire disgrace! "

They reach'd the fatal spot; the chains that bound
The crystal vase and emerald tripod round,
The gloomy monarch seiz'd — and as he broke,
Deep thunders roil'd, and all the fabric shook;

Thro' air, thro' fire, and thro' the sapphire wave

Each structure trembled; high the billows rear'd 640

The yawning ground admits the unusual day,

And new volcanos burst their furious way,

The gathering clouds deform the azure heaven,

The mountains fall, by frequent lightning riven,

Their prayers and tears affrighted mortals pour'd,

And anxious Ariel knew the Veil kestor'd!

He blest the sign, and from his throne on high,

Shot like a falling meteor thro' the sky.

The king meanwhile, with sad yet haughty look, 650
To Henry gave the fatal Veil, and spoke:
" Fate crowns thy arms, proud mortal; I resign

" Fool that I was, to risk the chance of arms,

" With all that deeper tenderness refined,

" That fits the nature of the ethereal mind?

" But when I found thy love was sought in vain,

" By him whose mandate awes this vast domain, 750

" I hail'd with rapture pleasure's dawning ray,

" The happy prelude to her cloudless day.

" The rest thou know'st — no longer fate denies,

" I soar triumphant to my native skies."

" And wilt thou leave me," sigh'd the weeping fair,
" In this dark realm of anguish and despair?"

" Leave thee!" Aurelio cried, " bereft of thee,
" The realms of light would boast no charms for me!
" I call thee hence, a Sylph's pure joys to share
" In those bright fields of empyrean air." 760

" Stay!" said the king, in whom Aurelio's tale
Wak'd a faint hope again to claim the Veil,
" Dar'st thou, a Sylph, and hence my mortal foe^
" Thus venture thro' the hostile realms below,
" E'en in my presence dare to own the offence,
" And hope to pass unmark'd, unpunish'd hence?— -

" Ho! seize him guards!" — he starapt upon the ground:

The ready vassals enter'd at the sound,

While his brave comrades hasten'd to defend

The weeping damsel and their injur'd friend; 770

When o'er their heads a dreadful crash was heard,

A sudden fissure in the dome appear'd,

The blazing lamps grew dim, an azure ray

Shot thro' the dreary realm unwonted day,

While down the steep descent, with rapid flight,

His Sylphs great Ariel bore, enthron'd in light;

And at his side was seen a lovely maid,

Bright Amiantha, as a bride array'd.

" Is this a monarch's faith? these abject chains,"
He cried, " are these the meed a victor gains? 780

Here at thy call he came, a mortal knight,
With thee to prove the equal chance of fight.
With mortal strength thy mightier arm he dar'd,
And as a mortal claims his due reward;
Claims for himself, these knights, and damsel fair,
Free passage to the realms of light and air.
What frenzy rules thee? why does passion blind
The light of reason in thy noble mind?



book vi. THE RESTORATION. 279

" Has not experience taught thy soul to know

u From purer sources purer pleasures flow? 790

" Shake off thy bonds; or since a monarch's throne

" Wants half its lustre while he rules alone,

" This maid behold! — nor can these regions find

" A nymph more fair in person or in mind;

" How long with smother'd fires she vainly lov'd

" I need not say, this every act has prov'd!

" And many a Gnome remembers yet the days

" Thine ear was pleas'd with Amiantha's praise.

" And more, thy life preserv'd from Pyros' hand,

" Who stretch'd her dying brother on the sand, 800

u Claims this just tribute from a generous chief.

" And calls on thee to sooth a sister's grief."

He ceas'd; with downcast eyes the monarch stands.
Nor moves, nor speaks, in anguish clasp'd his hands;
At length remorse and reason vanquish'd pride,
And he with new affection hail'd his bride.

" I yield — forgive my errors past," he said,
" Ye valiant knights, and each afflicted maid;
" Oh! here may all Maria's sufferings close!
" Be this the last of Amiantha's woes! 810

" For me! the memory of this painful hour

" Shall curb my passions, quench the thirst of power,

" And teach henceforth my sterner soul to find

" A gentle guide in Amiantha's mind;

" Between the Gnomes and Sylphs might discord cease,

" And mighty Ariel's voice confirm the peace."

" 'Tis done," the Sylph replied: " the Veil restor'd,
" I wage no war with earth's imperial lord;
" Peace in our realms shall rest, and stretch her chain
" O'er fire's bright regions, and the azure main. 820

" I lit the torch of war, the furious fire
" I fan no longer, and the flames expire!"



The monarch spoke, and call'd Maria fair,
With each brave knight, to mount the radiant chair;
The Sylphs ascending cleave the heavy air.

Now to Albruno's hall his subjects prest
In happy crowds to grace his nuptial feast.
Again by Chrysos rul'd, in paths of truth,
O'er his glad people reign'd the immortal youth;
And still, with gentle though unseen controul, 830

Mild Amiantha curb'd his fiery soul,



book vi. THE RESTORATION. 281

And oft the grateful Gnomes, in loud acclaim,
Join'd peace and love with Amiantha's name.

Meanwhile, where Albion's fertile vales extend,
Their chosen brides the three brave youths attend,
The friendly Gnomes a sumptuous palace rais'd,
Each marble hall with gems unnumber'd blaz'd;
The sportive sisters of the deep, around
The stately columns wreaths of coral bound,
And all the shining treasures of the wave 840

To frame a grot of ample size they gave.
Innumerous seeds, the spoils of distant lands,
The Sylphids scatter'd from their airy hands,
The fiery spirits gently warm the earth,
And push each gay exotic into birth;
There, breathing fragrance, the Magnolias vied
" In snow-white innocence and purple pride;"
While drest in roseate buds and leaves of green,
The Kalmia rivals her delightful queen;
Proud of her form, in classic grace array 'd, 850

Tall Agapantha rears her purple head,*

* The agapanthus umbellatus, is a Cape plant, and remarkable for the
graceful form of its leaves and flowers. The leaves fall in a curve on each
side of the stem, which, rising to the height of two feet, bears on its summit
a cluster of blue flowers, that before they expand have a great similarity to
the Grecian honey-suckle.



282 THE RESTORATION. book vi.

In varying dyes each gay Protea springs,

And Passiflora spreads her scarlet wings;

O'er all superior, tall Agave tow'rs,

And the bright Aloe glows with crimson flowers.

The Sylphids caught, and rang'd in lines of light,

The stars that shoot athwart the gloom of night.

To sight reveal'd, in various forms they move,

One Hymen seems, and one the God of Love,

High in their hands their flaming torches bear, S6'0

And crown with roseate wreaths each happy pair.

Great Ariel now appeared — his gentle look
Glanced on each lovely maid, as thus he spoke:
" Hail! blooming nymphs, whose constancy restor'd
" My lov'd Aurelio to his happy lord.
" Your woes — a Sylph from human bondage freed—*
" Claim from his grateful king an ample meed,
" For thee, Maria! now his chosen bride,
" Nor less in virtue to our race allied:
" Ne'er shall thy lips resign the vital breath, 870

" Thy roses fade, or close thine eyes in death.
'" Not like Tithonus, doom'd to bear the strife
Ci Of mortal weakness with immortal life,



book vi. THE RESTORATION. 283

" Each circling year to that fair form and face

" Shall add fresh lustre, more ethereal grace,

" Till thy pure spirit shall spontaneous rise,

" And seek its destin'd station in the skies;

" As Alighieri, with his heavenly love,

" Soar'd to yon round of silver light above,

" A partner in thy joys, thy hopes, thy cares, 8SO

" Till then his human form Aurelio wears.

" Miranda, Leonora, lovely pair!
" And ye, brave knights, their mortal lot who share,
" Yours be each joy that cheers the child of earth,
" A blooming race shall deck your social hearth;
" And when, as all of human lineage must,
" Your breath expires, and dust returns to dust,
" No widow's eye shall weep her spouse's doom;
" One be your dying hour, and one your tomb.
" Your spirits rising in a train of light, 890

" Shall with new splendours grace yon vaulted height.*



* Previous to the discovery of the four new planets, Ceres, Pailas, Juno,
and Vesta, Mr. Maclaurin and others, from the general analogy of our sys-
tem, entertained the idea of the existence of a planet between Mars and
Jupiter, and the attention of astronomers was directed to that part of the
heavens. In January, 1801, Mr. Piazzi discovered a planet in the expected
situation, but not larger than our moon. This planet he named Ceres: but

" In that vast space, 'twixt Jove's imperial sphere

" And fiery Mars, four smaller orbs appear,

" Yours be the task to rule their course on high,

" And guide the kindred worlds along the sky.



it was so small, that after it was lost in the beams of the sun, there was great
difficulty in finding it again; and it was not till 1807 that it was recognized
by Dr. Ollbers, of Bremen. In the meantime, Dr. Ollbers and Mr. Hard-
ing, in their search for this planet, discovered two others, (Juno and Pallas,)
which, upon calculation, appeared to have orbits precisely the same as that
of Ceres, in their distance from the sun, and only differing in obliquity.
From this singular circumstauce, Dr. Ollbers conceived the idea that these
three planets might have been originally combined in one larger orb, which
had been divided by some violent commotion. Were this the case, the frag-
ments, from the regulated attraction of the sun and the other planets, would
continue to revolve at the same distance from the sun, but the obliquity of
their orbits would be determined by the direction in which they were thrown
off. These orbits would however possess two common points of intersection,
or nodes, namely, the point in which the parent planet was, at the time when
it was rent by the convulsion, and the point opposite to it. The orbits of the
three new planets being calculated, appeared to have these points of inter-
section; and Dr. Ollbers, confirmed in his theory, and thinking there might
be more planets, continued his observations, which, in September, 1808, werti
rewarded by the discovery of the planet Vesta. The orbit of Vesta intersects
that of Pallas, but not in the place where it is cut by that of Ceres.

Pond's Lectures.
In the poem the new planets are made use of, but not on the system of Dr.
Ollbers. I have supposed them not to be the fragments of one unhappy
planet, but coeval in their birth, to have revolved from the beginning in the
same sphere. We may presume that any convulsion sufficient to rend a planet
would have produced a sensible effect on all parts of the solar system. The re-
ciprocal attractions of the planets must have been altered, they must have
been accelerated or retarded in their course, and such an extraordinary event,
had it happened since the creation of man, could hardly have been unre-
corded, if not in the writings of the learned, at least in the traditions of the
vulgar.

" Join'd in your fates below, and joined above

" In mystic intercourse of holy love,

" To circle yon pure source of day, and bound

" In one bright sphere your planetary round."

He spoke. No words their gratitude express'd, yOO
But Ariel read it in each joyful breast.
