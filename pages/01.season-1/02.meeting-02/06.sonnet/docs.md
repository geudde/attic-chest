Sonnetto

Gli angeli, il sol, la luna erano intorno  
&emsp;&emsp;Al seggio di Natura in paradiso,  
&emsp;&emsp;Quando formaron, Donna, il vostro viso  
&emsp;&emsp;D’ogni beltà pefettamente adorno —  
Era l’aer sereno e chiaro il giorno;  
&emsp;&emsp;Giove alternava con sua figlia il riso;  
&emsp;&emsp;E tra le belle grazie Amore assiso  
&emsp;&emsp;Stavasi a mirar voi suo bel soggiorno.  
Indi quaggiù per alta meraviglia  
&emsp;&emsp;Scese vostra beltà prescritta in cielo  
&emsp;&emsp;Di quante mai fien belle eterna idea.  
Abbian altre begli occhi, e belle ciglia,  
&emsp;&emsp;Bel volto, bella man, bell tutto il velo;  
&emsp;&emsp;Giove da voi turre le belle crea!

Sonnet

Th’ Anglic host, the sun, the moon, array’d  
&emsp;&emsp;In splendid majesty, around the seat  
&emsp;&emsp;Of nature ?? were plac’d, oh! beauteous maid  
&emsp;&emsp;When those were form’s with ev’ry grace repleat  
The day was clear and bright, the sky serene  
&emsp;&emsp;Jove on his daughter mutual smiles bestow’d  
&emsp;&emsp;And ’midst the Graces playful love was seen  
&emsp;&emsp;Admiring thee his beautiful abode.  
Then here below our wond’ring sight to bless  
&emsp;&emsp;They lovely form was sent by Heav’n assign’d  
&emsp;&emsp;The model of all future charms to bear.  
Let other maidens beauteous eyes profess  
&emsp;&emsp;Or face, or hand, or ev’ry charm combin’d,  
&emsp;&emsp;For Jove from thee alone creates each grace.  
	
I have endeavor’d to translate nearly literally the *admirable* sonnet of Fracastoro but I fear I have not done sufficient justice to so exquisite or ??? Angels, Sun, Moon, Paradise, Jove, Love, the Graces
