On Ezla’s pleasant Banks reclined,  
&emsp;Two happy Lovers talked apart;  
The myrtle with the Rose they twined,  
&emsp;And Vows renewed flowed from each Heart.  
  
To arms stern honour called the Youth  
&emsp;His Country’s freedom to maintain,  
Ah! much he doubted then her Truth,  
&emsp;For jealousy’s the Lover’s bane.  
  
Dejected when he viewed the strand,  
&emsp;She marked his mien, his altered eye,  
Then wrote these words upon the Sand  
&emsp;“Death for thy Ellen not Inconstancy.”  
  
All in an orange grove unseen  
&emsp;Sly Cupid laughing took his stand  
On Woman’s Faith to see him lean  
&emsp;Or trust to Vows inscribed in Sand.  
	  
Fair Ezla’s Banks describe right well  
&emsp;The offerings to Saint Valentine  
For all his hopes ere Curfew bell  
&emsp;Each flattered Lover must resign.  
  
Yet for the Mole that gilds thy cheek  
&emsp;I’ll give the wealth of Samarcand  
Or on Love’s Pinions boldly seek  
&emsp;The gems of India’s glowing land.  
  
To Lethe’s flood all fears I will confine  
If thou wilt deign to be my Valentine.  
  
I.
