> Given to Eliza, on Valentine’s Day    
    
Hear me Eliza! while I pray    
On Venus’ fav’rite holiday —    
May it be me propitious shine!    
O take me for thy Valentine!    
    
True I cannot with varnish’d art    
Speak the no— anguish of my heart;    
And, feeling nothing, sigh & whine    
Like a false modern Valentine.    
    
But I can love with Love so true    
As e’en almost to merit you.    
With thine my heart-strings I can twice    
O take me for thy Valentine!    
    
For I can watch thy speaking eyes,    
Can catch thy wishes as they rise,    
Can make thy joys & sorrows mine,    
And be thy real Valentine.    
    
Each care, each sigh that breaks my rest,    
Shall meet its brother in my breast.    
With thee I’ll smile, with Thee I’ll pine,    
In joy or grief thy Valentine.    
    
The kindest Turtles of the grove    
Nor do, nor can more truly love,    
E’en while their glowing beaks they join,    
Than my Eliza’s Valentine:    
    
For blended in my constant heart,    
Friendship, & Love devoid of art,    
In cordial unison combine    
To make me a true Valentine.    
    
Ah! may the dear illusion last    
Till life’s short various day be past:    
May we Eliza! ne’er refrine,    
But feel each day is Valentine.    
    
At last, when age’s shrivel’d hand    
Untwines the gentle rosy band,    
I’ll press my clay-cold lips to thine,    
And die Eliza’s Valentine.
