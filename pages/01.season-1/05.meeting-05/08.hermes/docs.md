The God of arts and trade am I  
And Mortals call me Mercury  
As Fitz-Pieria lately told  
Last month I did your charms behold  
One night when you to Berners Street  
Addrest your sable slippered feet  
That night the Attic chest was read  
And to my heart Loves arrow sped  
If youâ€™ll but crown this Love of mine  
A God shall be your Valentine  
An honour charming girl at most  
But Three since time was born can boast  

Hermes
