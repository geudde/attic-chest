> Impromptu  
  
There was little Jack Horner  
Once sat in a corner,  
Eating of Christmas Pie,  
He put in his thumb  
And pull’d out a Plumb  
Then cried what a good Boy am I!  
But Charles Ferdinando  
Did with Mr Foot-Man go  
And stood at the corner so sly,  
When Mr Footman did laugh  
Charles cried, ‘give me half’  
That I may some pastry go buy.  
Look here said his crony  
They gave me bad Money  
There’s nobody’ll take it I’m sure  
Cried Charles ‘What an Ass!  
To take such bad brass  
Such a trick I can never endure,’  
So on profit, both bent  
To fighting they went  
A Damsel who stood laughing by  
How foolish cried she  
These two young Men be  
And Charley will get a black eye!  
  
Moral  
  
Money is the root _of all_ Evil.
