Rise Honest Muse and to the liberal Lyre  
Symphonious sing, what Friendship shall inspire.  
Say! shall the Man to gain devoted, Claim  
A place conspicuous Midst the sons of Fame?  
For ill got wealth with dying accents given  
To bribe the vengeance of impartial heaven!  
And shall not he who midst the din of Trade  
Has hommage at the Muses Altars paid  
Attention gain and gratitude inspire  
And with his worth excite the poets fire?  
Yes! P-d-n Yes! My Muse in liberal lays  
This friendly Tribute to thy Merit pays,  
And Ardent hopes that ages yet unborn  
May be well pleasâ€™d, thy name, her works adorn.  
  
Dido
