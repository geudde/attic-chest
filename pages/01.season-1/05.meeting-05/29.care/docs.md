Ah why with such mischievous care  
Arrange those Locks around thy face  
But to lead Captive by a hair  
And wound by every varying grace  
  
And why that Scarf of glowing hue  
With flame, they slender form attire  
Ah! â€™tis an Emblem sad yet true  
Of the fierce flame in which they slaves expire

Love is a Burthen, which two hearts  
When equally they bear their parts  
With Pleasure carry; but no one,  
Alas! can bear it long alone
