Though the sweetest vermilion adorn  
The cheek of the beautiful fair,  
Though her face boasts the freshness of morn  
And the graces embellish her air,  
Yet the passion which these can inspire  
Is cold, and will quickly decay;  
Such charms for a while we admire,  
But fleeting and short is their sway â€”  
When goodness illumines the face  
And good nature enlivens the smile,  
Then all that in beauty we prize,  
Will the heart of the gazer beguile.  
  
Valentinus
