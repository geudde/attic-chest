In grim array of play and pay,  
With Kings, Queens, Knaves, and Rubbers,  
Your sprightly wit delights to sit  
Altho’ it be with Lubbers;  
  
Your smiles are due to Cass, and Loo,  
And eke your frowns so dreary,  
Then let us see what luck you’ve had  
And be a little cheary;  
  
One Valentine I’ve lost to you,  
*Eleven* to me you’ll render,  
I’ve sent but slip-slop stuff too true,  
Let your returns be tender.
