“It is an age of wonders that we live in”  
Each day example of this truth is giving  
In Fairy ring about their parent springs  
A proudly glittering band of Mushroom Kings  
Their children, Dukedoms, lesser Fungi rise  
Beyond a ring of meaner dignities  
The sad alternative the Commons grieve  
Or Evidence or Honor to believe  
While in the papers his respected name  
Sees many a man and trembles for his fame  
An Amazon now guides of War the helm  
And sends each briber to his favourite realm  
And if we further turn our eyes behind  
We see a General ride on every wind  
A North Sir Hew, a South Sir Harry brings  
And from their wisdom a convention springs  
Homeric days and deeds return again  
The Gods now visit and now mimic men  
Hermes to see the God of every mouse[^1]  
Must call upon him at his Delphic House  
The immortal Muses are like Modern Ladies  
And noble Pegasus a hack oft made is  
And cause for wonder see a young man’s eyes  
On Fancy’s wings soar upwards to the skyes  
There fix’d yea form a constellation there  
And laughing ogle Berenice’s Hair  
The ladies envious his good fortune see  
And wish their eyes might hear his company  
  
Miraclius
