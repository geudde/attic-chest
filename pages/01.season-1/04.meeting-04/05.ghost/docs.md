##### A Long & *True* Story

Old Minos gall’d at this reception  
&emsp;&emsp;So riotous, so strange, so rude —  
Gravely gave out as his conception  
&emsp;&emsp;The Ghost was one of Satan’s brood!  
  
Indeed, quoth he ’tis plain & level  
&emsp;&emsp;Since Taylors at the next door dwell,  
That this same Ghost must be the Devil  
&emsp;&emsp;Hid in the Taylors motley Hell! [^2]  
  
Forthwith in solemn order sped  
&emsp;&emsp;His Worship to the hapless Taylors,  
His valiant Van by Runners led;  
&emsp;&emsp;His Rear brought up by Clarks and Jailors,  
  
How poor is language, Art how vain  
&emsp;&emsp;To speak the pangs that guilt produces  
Where culprits view the rattling chain,  
&emsp;&emsp;Or gibbets tall, or dangling nooses.  
  
So *Snip*, whose conscience somewhat soil’d  
&emsp;&emsp;In truth was rather *worse for wear*,  
In anguish from the sight recoil’d  
&emsp;&emsp;When first he saw the Justice there!  
  
Swift on his knees the varlet try’d  
&emsp;&emsp;His Worship’s pity to awaken —  
And with a mournful accent cry’d,  
&emsp;&emsp;“Take all my *cabbage*, spare my bacon!”  
  
At this the Inquisitor was huff’d  
&emsp;&emsp;Judging it offer’d in derision,  
So straight poor tremb’ling Snip was cuff’d  
&emsp;&emsp;And sent to Limbo for “misprision!” —  
  
His little darling daughter then  
&emsp;&emsp;By solemn sacred oath was bound,  
  
[^2]: The place in which the Taylors throw their remnants.

To tell unto these *legal* men  
&emsp;&emsp;“If aught she knew that made the sound”!  
  
Her answer, simple thing, was plain.  
&emsp;&emsp;“She nothing knew and nothing heard”  
Nor all their quirking arts could gain,  
&emsp;&emsp;Another syllable or word! —  
  
But now at last this Ghost is laid!  
&emsp;&emsp;Without or Priest, or sage confessor, —  
Thanks to the *Institution’s* aid  
&emsp;&emsp;Who sent their learned *sound* Professor!  
  
He watched the rattling wonder slowly,  
&emsp;&emsp;He bid the folks their terrors hush;  
Then swore by all that Saints deem holy  
&emsp;&emsp;The Noise was made by wooden Brush!  
  
And to confirm his affirmation,  
&emsp;&emsp;And shame all rude incred’lous airs,  
He told them that the ghostly station  
&emsp;&emsp;Lay underneath the kitchen stairs!  
  
And true as Fate on bursting in  
&emsp;&emsp;To where the spirit lay *perdue*  
They found the secret of the din, —  
&emsp;&emsp;Molly the Housemaid met their view!  
  
There hid, the Jade had play’d the Ghost,  
&emsp;&emsp;With jack-weight, Brushes, bells and stones;  
Or when the *plaintives* pleased her most  
&emsp;&emsp;Assail’d their ears with sighs & groans!  
  
This closed the Scene — refuse who can  
&emsp;&emsp;A triffling tribute of applause  
To hear who pos’d a cunning man  
&emsp;&emsp;And eke the cunning Men of Laws.  
  
And now a moral to the Tale;  
&emsp;&emsp;And then concludes our harmless Labour  
*Look well at home, ere you assail*  
&emsp;&emsp;*With Fool-born Fears* your next door Neighbour!
