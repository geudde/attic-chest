The extreme severity of the weather, having prevented many of our friends from attending our last Reading — We shall at their request commence this Evenings amusement, by repeating the former numbers. Among the novelties we have to present a Riddle, for the exercise of the investigatory faculties of our hearers, of which the subject is ingeniously enveloped in verse.

Secondly a Sonnet on a splendid Pile of Ruins which impresses a melancholy truth on the fancy.

Third. The Three Kisses the emanation of a delicate and feeling mind, and Fourth the charming verses signed Violetta.

The Description of Monkey Island and The Queen Anne Street Ghost are perhaps not new to all our audience but as they have been read irregularly we once more bring them forward presuming that their merit will give them charms tho’ they may no longer possess that of novelty.

We fear that we shall perceive many a long face when we announce that Fitz Pieria has not favoured us this Evening with a continuation of his humourous poem, but Hope which according to the Poet

> 	Travels thro’ life, nor quits us when we die,”

has made us strong promises for the future.

Before our next meeting a day will recur which once a year sets the fancy of the young and the gay in agitation and we hereby require that all Valentines given and received by our Correspondents shall be placed in the Attic Chest to be read on Tuesday the 20th inst. But we do not require that the name of either giver or receiver shall be announced unless by consent as we have no wish to publish the amourous secrets of the young and the fair.
