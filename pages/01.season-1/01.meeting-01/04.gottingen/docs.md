<div class="poem">
Ah me, and are ye going to,<br>
&emsp;The wars for to be shotten in;<br>
Soon will ye mourn, alas ye Stu—<br>
—dents of hapless, of the far-famed U—<br>
&emsp;—Niversity of Gottingen 

Soon will ye hate that much-loved Bu—<br>
&emsp;—onaparte, now so hot-in-grain;<br>
Ye never thought he’d conscribe you,<br>
But more would reverence the U—<br>
&emsp;—Niversity of Gottingen. 

How did ye look around, how view,<br>
&emsp;The Books ye had been blotting in,<br>
When first the dreadful news ye knew,<br>
That bade ye bid a last adieu,<br>
&emsp;To them and eke to Gottingen. 

<span data-tippy="All soldiers non to Spain" class="green">Though new the Spanish plains</span> ye Stu—<br>
&emsp;—dents bold, <span data-tippy="in troops are" class="green">you are proudly</span> trotting in,<br>
<span data-tippy="And" class="green">You</span> soon may find good cause to rue<br>
The moment when ye left the U—<br>
&emsp;—Niversity of Gottingen. 

Unused to hardship ye will rue,<br>
&emsp;The mischiefs ye are plotting in,<br>
Anxious will sit, and sadly view,<br>
With Fancy’s eye the distant U—<br>
&emsp;—Niversity of Gottingen. 

When ye are dead I wonder who,<br>
&emsp;Will tell the Graves ye’re rotting in,<br>
Or even say here lie a few,<br>
“Who studied morals, at the U—”<br>
&emsp;—Niversity of Gottingen. 

“Oxford and Cambridge, sisters two,<br>
&emsp;With prejudice begotten in,”<br>
Proud will look round, and sneering view,<br>
You and your poor forsaken U—<br>
&emsp;—Niversity of Gottingen.
