Ah me, and are ye going to,  
&emsp;The wars for to be shotten in;  
Soon will ye mourn, alas ye Stu—  
-dents of hapless, of the far-famed U-  
&emsp;-Niversity of Gottingen  
  
Soon will ye hate that much-loved Bu-  
&emsp;-onaparte, now so hot-in-grain;  
Ye never thought he’d conscribe you,  
But more would reverence the U-  
&emsp;-Niversity of Gottingen.  
  
How did ye look around, how view,  
&emsp;The Books ye had been blotting in,  
When first the dreadful news ye knew,  
That bade ye bid a last adieu,  
&emsp;To them and eke to Gottingen.  
  
All soldiers non to Spain ye Stu-  
&emsp;-dents bold, our troops are trotting in,  
And soon may find good cause to rue  
The moment when ye left the U-  
&emsp;-Niversity of Gottingen.  
  
Unused to hardship ye will rue,  
&emsp;The mischiefs ye are plotting in,  
Anxious will sit, and sadly view,  
With Fancy’s eye the distant U-  
&emsp;-Niversity of Gottingen.  
  
When ye are dead I wonder who,  
&emsp;Will tell the Graves ye’re rotting in,  
Or even say here lie a few,  
“Who studied morals, at the U-”  
&emsp;-Niversity of Gottingen.  
  
“Oxford and Cambridge, sisters two,  
&emsp;“With prejudice begotten in,”  
Proud will look round, and sneering view,  
You and your poor forsaken U-  
&emsp;-Niversity of Gottingen.
