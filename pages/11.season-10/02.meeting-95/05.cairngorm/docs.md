Wear thy Mountain’s Diamond, Fairest!  
&emsp;With thy waving hair;  
It shall noblest seem & rarest  
&emsp;If it sparkes there:  
For only this dark gem can vie  
With those brown tresses’ burnished dye,  
And well the elves that guard it know  
If it might touch thy spotless brow  
For ever in they memory  
Thy wedded love would living be.  
  
Or hanging on the ear, Dearest,  
&emsp;A moment let it shine  
Then in ev’ry voice thou hearest  
&emsp;Shall seem a sound of mine:  
Yet no — for never by the tone  
Of silver words is true-love known —   
I would not tax thy soul to give  
The fondness that on words can live:  
Think not on mine — there was but one  
I strove to speak, yet utter’d none.  
  
But wear it on thy hand, sweetest,  
&emsp;Clasp’d with the holy gold  
Then if a stranger’s hand thou meetest  
&emsp;Thine shall be winter-cold;  
And thou shalt lute or tablet take  
In bow’r or chamber for my sake,  
And it shall teach thy pen to shew  
How thoughts are told when hearts are true.  
  
Then hide it in they breast, dearest!  
&emsp;If it be pure as fair  
When to thy heart this gem is nearest  
&emsp;My image shall be there:  
For it has spells more sure & strong  
When hid its native snows among  
And it shall have most pow’r to bless  
Where all is peace and holiness.
