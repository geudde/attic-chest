Examine this knot of Lille thread  
Of a texture, so firm, yet so fine,  
And observe, with what gracefulness, strength  
And fair Purity’s emblem combine.  
  
May the thread of your days, like this knot,  
Be drawn to a long winding clew,  
And the rough trace of sorrow and care,  
Be small as its specks, and as few.  
  
May health give you spirits and strength,  
Through a course of mild virtue to run;  
As this thread — so each action of Life,  
When exposed, shall grow bright in the Sun!
