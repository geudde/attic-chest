The proud Canal serene and deep  
Beneath it saw the streamlet creep —   
“Haste! babbler, haste thee on,” it cried  
“Thou emblem of cold Wisdom’s pride!  
Go, steal they winding way along,  
With gilded pebbles make thy song;  
Regale the sunburnt shepherd’s flock  
Or tinkle through the barren rock —   
Feed if thou canst yon humble flow’r  
Companion of thy little hour  
Then slumber in thy parent earth  
Hid by the clay that gave thee birth!”  
  
Submissive paus’d the modest brook  
And whisper’d thus its mild rebuke:  
“Unsure I win my quiet way,  
Unheard ’midst honied wildflow’rs play —   
My music soothes the lonely ear  
My gifts the cottage banquet cheer  
But though thro’ dim and devious gloom  
I murmur now, — the hour shall come  
When in a region bland & bright  
My peaceful stream shall burst to light  
And mingle with the boundless sea  
Of Life and Joy’s Eternity!”  
  
“Such is my doom — and what is thine  
Thou miracle of art divine!  
Condemn’d the gaudy frights to bear  
Of shallow pomp and sordid care  
While iron bondage quells thy force  
And slaves like thee direct they course,  
Thy giant arches shall decay  
Thy borrow’d flood shall pass away;  
Ambition’s vassal sons shall see  
Their glories shrink to dust like thee  
While to free Ocean’s breast is given  
The semblance and the light of Heaven!”
