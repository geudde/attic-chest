Go, gentle Sylph! thy pinions fleet  
Might reach the “Glacier’s stormy seat”!  
Thou of all elements the queen  
May best illume the deathful scene  
Where ice gives fiery meteors birth  
And stiffen’d ocean vies with Earth:  
But send not all they pity forth  
With pilgrims to the frozen north,  
Pity thy Bards whose spirits quell’d  
Are in a frozen circle held  
Condemn’d by thy neglect to sleep  
In dumb oblivion, dark and deep,  
Encompass’d by the blue fiend’s realm  
Whose fogs the captive soul o’erwhelm.  
Come, then! — with bland and genial sway  
The icy barriers melt away,  
From long oblivious frost release  
Of wand’ring thoughts whole colonies  
That all in search of gems and flow’rs  
Stray’d far from safe domestic bow’rs  
As pilgrims rov’d to Greenland’s shore  
And prison’d there, return’d no more.  
  
Alas! thus Folly’s venturers roam  
From the calm temp’rate zone of Home,  
Of gaudy toys and dreams in quest  
Till bitter gales their speed arrest  
And bare and bruis’d their bark is hurl’d  
On the cold Arctic of the World  
To dwell bound up in icy chains  
While Life’s long polar winter reigns,  
In pomp magnificently drear  
As the blank ice-field’s dismal glare:  
Unless, like thee, some gentle star  
Of kind affection gleams from far  
And leads to peaceful duty’s track  
The long-forgotten wand’rers back.  
  
Speak, gentle Sylph! — at thy command  
Our frozen climate shall grow bland —  
Come, and with playful meteors gild  
Our fancy’s region dimm’d and chill’d;  
While ice winds breathe their cold monsoon  
Be thou th’unchanging Arctic moon  
That dark and devious regions through  
May lead thy poet’s light canoe  
To some bright vale where all unseen  
Long truant joys have hidden been,  
Like the lost race that home again  
Norwegia’s pastor call’d in vain.  
But fear not then that unknown force  
Shall sway Attraction’s alter’d course;  
For though within the dread controul  
Of that dark zone that binds the pole  
The needle from its place may turn  
And loadstones other influence learn,  
The true heart shall not lose its skill —  
Thyself shall be its magnet still.
