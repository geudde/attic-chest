<div class="author">Miss Porden</div>  

Were all men honest — well I ween  
On earth I never yet had been  
Yet, and I glory in the boast —  
’Tis robbers that detest me most.  

A faithful friend, I closely hide  
Whate’er to me my lords confide —  
Nor tattle on my own affairs  
My heart one trusty brother shares.  

Tho parted oft, to him alone —  
Its movements, and its springs are known  
But he, when handled by the base  
Turn’d to their use, my trust betrays.  

Yet many a Proteus shape I wear  
Now shine like gold, am black or fair,  
And now with added charms I deck  
(Native or false) Belinda’s neck.  

I analiz’d the world of mind,  
Like Helen once my ravish’d charms  
Caus’d man — and more than man to arms  
Nor can one sportsman’s gun be heard.  

The death knell of some hapless bird  
Nor on the Battle’s fatal day  
One musquet ball can seek its prey  
Until I give its fury way —  

Of my third quarter basely reft  
A Scandinavian God I’m left,  
But not improv’d, I take to evil  
Something between a Puck and devil.  

Nay more this Isle’s unrivall’d trade  
Could scarce subsist without my aid,  
Or streams unfailing proudly bear  
The freighted barge this Earth and air  
Then, Ladies haste, my secret shew,  
And I’m no more myself to you.
