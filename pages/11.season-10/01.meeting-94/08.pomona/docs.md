<div class="author">Miss Appleton</div> 

Yes — soft heaved the Vessel, and smooth curled the wave,  
&emsp;When the foreign shores peeped from the mist;  
And light blew the zephyr — and still as the grave  
&emsp;Was the sail, which the rosy dawn kiss’d.

And fair rose the prospect, as Dieppe drew nigh  
&emsp;In her portly antiquity drest;  
With her green glowing landscape, and deep azure sky,  
&emsp;And her children deck’d strange in their best.

And rich looked the country, and wide stretch’d the road,  
&emsp;And most ample the cheer on the way,  
The twice-roasted fowl was of no sturdy brood,  
&emsp;And the omelette was fried the same day.

And what if the rain on the chaise beat at last,  
&emsp;If the rain did not drip *much* within?  
And what if, at times, horse and rider stuck fast,  
&emsp;If nor rider nor horse cared a pin?

Did not old Ducal Rouen look proud from her hill,  
&emsp;And the merry bridges dance on her Seine?  
While her crowded quays teemed with mirth, frolic, and skill,  
&emsp;And a little world’s gambol’s for gain.

And what tho’ the Wolf be a rarity here?  
&emsp;That the race is extinct, does not follow.  
The flow’r of the City, and Chivalry there,  
&emsp;Was *un Loup*, in the form of Apollo.

And brilliant was Paris — elastic her clime —  
&emsp;And enchanting each scene as it rose —  
And the hotbeds of pleasure force quick to their prime,  
&emsp;And the fruit pines away, as it grows.

And Brussels, and Mechlin, and Antwerp, fair were  
&emsp;And their Gothic piles peaceful to view;  
And comic the Gala to make Mynheer stare,  
&emsp;And most dear, the now calm, Waterloo.

And what to each scene gave so finished a gest  
&emsp;As can make recollections so sweet?  
These eyes had beheld, and this foot the soil press’d  
&emsp;In which pleasure and courtesy meet.

’Tis a Secret to none — least to you, my sweet Maid,  
&emsp;Or Vitruvius who, our third did make  
The roving I lov’d — but the rovers still more —  
&emsp;And the travels are for *their* sake.

Then now let us sing — May God bless the old King  
&emsp;And God bless my fair, kind, Valentine —  
May the plumag’d woods ring, and the rural nymphs bring  
&emsp;A young Laurel to bind on her Shrine.
