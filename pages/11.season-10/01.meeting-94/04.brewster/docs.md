<span class="title">Dr B- - - - to Ellen with his Kaleidoscope</span>

The mighty tube that shares its fame  
With good old Galileo’s name  
Compar’d with this was but a whim  
For cloister’d schools and sages grim.  
The Seer of Florence only car’d  
To certify a comet’s beard  
But Art devises this to shew man  
The mind of Fashionable Woman!  
Has it a gilt exterior? — Well,  
It closer makes the parallel:  
At safe and modest distance seen,  
It seems an exquisite machine,  
For Genius or for Science fit  
To draw things near like Truth and Wit;  
But look within! — what motley heaps  
Of brittle things the covert keeps!  
Odd bead, mock jewels, shreds of lace,  
All find a temporary place;  
What seems a diamond, if you look  
Is but a pin’s head or a hook —   
A meteor or a star examin’d  
Is some poor bauble women cram in’t.  

See, thro’ how many thousand changes  
Their love or their ambition ranges!  
Now in a lover’s knot ’tis set,  
Now ’tis a ducal coronet!  
Now ribbons of all hues are streaming  
And now a knightly star is gleaming —   
Next, the shawl-pattern of a Hindu —   
And then — a church’s painted window!  
Yet seen by love’s light and afar,  
This motley mass seems regular;   
Sages to buy the toy desire  
And tho’ they laugh, they still admire.
  
But, Ladies! can no other thing  
A parallel with Brewster bring?  
Yes, one thing more — our little life  
Changes as swiftly as a wife —   
When first the gay optician Hope  
Presents us her <span class="small">KALEIDOSCOPE</small>,  
How bright before our dazzled eyes  
The ever-moving pageants rise!  
As in this toy’s refracting glass  
Chang’d ere they fix, the colours pass,  
Modes, friendships, pleasures, schemes and cares  
Fine forms, fine systems, and fine airs  
All in the gaudy wheel revolve  
Shine, mingle, waver, and dissolve.  
Thus Time and Fortune’s turns confuse  
All Heraldry’s unnumbered hues  
All the gay baubles Mortals prize,  
Crowns, garlands, stars, and radiant eyes  
Scarce gaz’d on ere they fade and fall —   
A breath — a step reverses all!   
Brief scene, yet beautiful and gay!  
Why snatch the secret spell away?  
Ah! rather worship the illusion  
That beautifies this rich confusion —   
Let Memory the fair circle fill,  
And keep her lovely prism still.  

Fair mistress of a gayer pow’r  
To wing away the frolic hour,  
Transform, by virtue of a Trope,  
The Chest to a Kaleidoscope  
Where ever-changing Fancy shews  
Here rarest shapes and richest hues :  
There, by the magic of thy twirl  
This mite of mine may seem a pearl,   
And thy own soul’s bright eye shall be  
The best <span class="small">KALEIDOSCOPE</span> for thee!
