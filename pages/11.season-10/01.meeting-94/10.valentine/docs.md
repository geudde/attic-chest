<span class="pencil">Valentine to a Young Lady very studious in Astronomy, from Ouranos</span>

From yonder fields of azure hue  
When summer skies are bright & clear  
Ouranos turns his eager view  
To gaze upon your kindred sphere

Then, fixed upon the dark blue heaven  
Those eyes that mock their tint I see,  
And think, that then thy thoughts are given  
Per chance mid other worlds to me.

Yet fate has fixed my gloomy lot  
Far from your smiles, and light, and love,  
And I to you am but a spot  
Your Heaven’s last confines doom’d to rove.

Your Orb, more near Hyperion’s ray  
Draws gladness from the golden beam,  
The noontide of my brightest day  
Is fainter than your twilight gleam.

And your short years must oft be told  
Ere comet’s flight could waft my sighs —  
But we with happier speed may hold  
Communion in our mutual eyes

And take the name my love bestows  
*Venus Urania* famed of yore  
Not when that high device she chose  
Cythera’s Queen was honour’d more.

And think if from your eyes should fly  
One smile of heavenly light to mine  
They shall be suns to me and I  
No more your gloomy Valentine.
