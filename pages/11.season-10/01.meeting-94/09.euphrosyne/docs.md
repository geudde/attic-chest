<div class="author">Miss Porden</div> 

Many our happy hours have been  
&emsp;By shining sun or showery weather,  
While lingering in some novel scene  
&emsp;Our eager feet explored together.

The fertile isles of placid Seine  
&emsp;That glimmer’d in the Evening light  
The forest shades of tangled green  
&emsp;And verdant hills with cliffs of white.

Rouen to British bosoms dear  
&emsp;And Paris with its spell of joy,  
Its shaded walks and fragrant air,  
&emsp;And domes that glitter in the sky.

And Brussels — yet the laugh forbear  
&emsp;If mean its pomp to English sight,  
And own the festal arches fair,  
&emsp;The laurel bowers, the evening light.

And more than all, that glorious sight,  
&emsp;Which still I paus’d and turn’d to view  
By Briton ne’er to be forgot  
&emsp;The sacred turf of Waterloo.

All these upon my mind return,  
&emsp;Say, Wanderer! do they dwell in thine,  
Or thinkest thou, on this conscious morn,  
&emsp;Of thy deserted Valentine.

Hard when we long had roam’d delighted  
&emsp;Till each became more dearly known  
That we, in stranger lands united,  
&emsp;Should thus be sever’d in our own.
