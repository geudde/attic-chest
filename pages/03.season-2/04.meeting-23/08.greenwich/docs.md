#### First of May  
  
#### 1  
  
Though clouds obscured the morning hour  
&emsp;And keen and eager blew the blast  
And drizzling fell the cheerless shower  
&emsp;As doubtful to the skiff we past.  
  
#### 2  
  
All soon propitious to our prayer  
&emsp;Gave promise of a brighter day  
The clouds dispers’d in brighter [purer] air  
&emsp;The blast in zephyrs died away  
  
#### 3  
  
So have we, Love, a day enjoy’d  
&emsp;On which we both — and yet who knows  
May dwell with pleasure unalloy’d  
&emsp;And dread no thorn beneath the rose  
  
#### 4  
  
How pleasant, from that dome crown’d hill  
&emsp;To view the varied scene below  
Woods, Ships, and spires, and lovelier still  
&emsp;The circling Thames’ majestic flow  
  
#### 5  
  
How sweet as indolently laid  
&emsp;We overhang that long drawn dale  
To watch the chequer’d light and shade  
&emsp;That glanc’d upon the shifting sail  
  
#### 6  
  
And when the shadow’s rapid growth  
&emsp;Proclaim’d the noon tide hour expir’d  
And though unwearied, nothing loath  
&emsp;We to our simple meal retired  
  
#### 7  
  
The sportive wile the blameless jest  
&emsp;The careless minds spontaneous flow  
Gave to that simple meal a zest  
&emsp;Which richer tables may not know  
  
#### 8  
  
The babe that on its mother’s breast  
&emsp;Has toy’d and wanton’d for a while  
And sinking to unconscious rest  
&emsp;Looks up to catch a parting smile  
  
#### 9  
  
Feels less assured than thou dear maid  
&emsp;Where ere thy ruby lips could part  
(It’s close to mine thy cheek was laid,)  
&emsp;Thine eyes had open’d all they heart  
  
#### 10  
  
Then, thou, I mark’d the chasten’d joy  
&emsp;That lightly o’er thy features stole  
From vows repaid (my sweet employ)  
&emsp;From truth from innocence of soul  
  
#### 11  
  
While every word dropt on my ear  
&emsp;So soft (and yet it seems to thrill)  
So sweet, that ’twas a heaven to hear  
&emsp;And e’en thy pause had musick still  
  
#### 12  
  
And O, how like a fairy dream  
To gaze in silence on the tide  
While soft and warm the sunny gleam  
Slept on the glassy surface wide  
  
#### 13  
  
And many a thought of fancy bred  
Wild, soothing, tender,
