#### Written in the year 1773 since corrected and altered  
  
Sacred to Patriot-Virtue and Renown!  
Raised by His weeping Country, and adorned  
With sculptured wreaths and Wolfe’s illustrious name,  
This marble stands. In prime of life he led  
Her veteran Sons — Her champion and her pride!  
On Abraham’s Heights, the doubtful Battle hung  
In dreadful balance, when the Hero’s eye  
Advanc’d to Heaven in speechless wishes, caught  
A radiant Form, that hovering o’er his head  
Cry’d, “Die Victorious or Defeated live.”  
“Victory and Death,” he said, then calmly urged  
Through all the terrors of the well-fought field  
His Country’s Cause — He conquer’d — and he died.  
  
This Marble, Britain! must resign his name  
By envious Time eras’d. Deep on the Hearts  
Of *all* thy sons, thro’ *every rising* race  
Record his virtue, victory and fall;  
That when, in righteous War, to them thy King  
Consigns his Armies, each may emulate  
Wolfe’s bright perfections, generous, brave, humane,  
Firm in the fight, in danger undismayed,  
To death devoted, if their death secure  
To Thee with Glory, Liberty and Peace.
