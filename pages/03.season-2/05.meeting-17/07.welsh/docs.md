> Translation of some lines on a departed *Friend*  
> From a Collection of Welsh Poems  
> By Dafydd ap Gwyllym  
  
“From dewy lawns I’ll pluck the rose,  
With every fragrant flower that blows  
The earliest primrose of the spring  
To Ivor’s honour’d grave I’ll bring —  
This humble rite shall oft be paid,  
To deck the spot where he is laid,  
To show how much for him I mourn,  
How much I weep o’er Ivor’s urn.”  
  
> From the same in his old age.  
  
“Ivor is gone! my friend most dear  
And nest, sweet soother of my care  
Murfredd, my soul’s delight, is fled —  
All moulder in their clay-cold bed!  
And I, oppress’d with woe remain  
Victim to old age, and ling’ring pain.”
