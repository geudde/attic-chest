<div class="author">Communicated by Mr Henry Thomson</div>

Oh! heard ye at midnight the tempest loud roaring?    
&emsp;Oh! saw ye the ocean that burst from its bed?    
Or the gay gallant vessel that broke from her mooring?    
&emsp;Oh! heard ye the wails, and the shrieks of the dead?    
  
All hush’d are the waves — and a hope may be cherish’d,    
&emsp;That once more the brave vessel may ride on the main,    
But alas! hapless kindred of those who have perish’d    
&emsp;Ye never shall hear their lov’d voices again.    
   
Proud Man! — Thou are heir but to trouble and sorrow,    
&emsp;Since thy breath thus depends on the wind & the tide;    
This moment’s thy own but whose is tomorrow,    
&emsp;The Being who made thee, alone can decide.    
  

> Written in the middle of a very tempestuous night
