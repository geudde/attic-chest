The following Stanzas upon Terror and Pity are taken from a small quarto pamphlet published about 60 or 70 years ago since entitled: “Melpomene; or the Regions of Terror and Pity” in which the poet speaking in the first person describes the various images exciting terror or pity —

A Rambler

The first extracts are taken from the part entitled

#### Terror

(Caused by Anger)

Ha! what is he whose fierce indignant eye,  
&emsp;Denouncing vengeance, kindles into flame?  
Whose boisterous fury blows a storm so high,  
&emsp;As with its thunder shakes his labouring frame.  
&emsp;&emsp;What can such rage provoke?  
&emsp;&emsp;His words their passage choke:  
&emsp;His eager steps, nor time nor truce allow,  
And dreadful dangers wait the menace of his brow.

(and Jealousy)

Before my wondering sense new phantoms dance,  
&emsp;And stamp their horrid shapes upon my brain —  
A wretch with jealous brow, and eyes askance,  
&emsp;Feeds all in secret on his bosom pain.  
&emsp;&emsp;Fond love, fierce hate, assail;  
&emsp;&emsp;Alternate they prevail:  
&emsp;While conscious pride and shame with rage conspire,  
And urge the latent spark to flames of torturing fire

#### Pity

(Caused by Another’s Grief)

Behold that beauteous maid! her languid head  
Bends like a drooping lily charg’d with rain  
With floods of tears she bathes a lover dead  
&emsp;In brave assertion of her honour slain  
&emsp;&emsp;Her bosom heaves with sighs  
&emsp;&emsp;To heaven she lifts her eyes  
&emsp;With grief beyond the power of words expressed  
Smiles on the lifeless corse and dies upon his breast.
