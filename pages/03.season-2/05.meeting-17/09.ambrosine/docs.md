What do I love? a polished mind,  
A temper cheeful, meek, and kind;  
A graceful air, unspoil’d by art,  
A voice that sinks into the heart;  
A playful and expressive smile,  
Alas! my heart responds the while;  
All this my Ambrosine is true,  
But I love more, in loving you.  
  
I love those roses when they rise,  
From anger, joy, and soft surprise;  
I love the kind attentive zeal,  
So prompt to know what others feel;  
The mildness which cannot reprove,  
But in the sweetest tones of love;  
All this my Ambrosine is true,  
But I love more in loving you.  
    
The self command which can sustain,  
In silence, weariness, and pain,  
The transport at a friend’s success,  
Which has not words or power to bless;  
Buy by the sudden starting tear,  
Appears more precious, more sincere;  
Oh! this my Ambrosine is true,  
And this I love in loving you.
