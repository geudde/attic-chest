Professions *will* abuse each other,  
The priest won’t call the lawyer brother,  
While he in kind beknaves the parson,  
And says he came to keep the farce on;  
Yet will I readily suppose,  
They are not truly bitter foes,  
But only have their pleasant jokes,  
And banter just like other folks.  
As thus, for so they quit the law,  
Once on a time th’ attorney flaw,  
A man, to tell you as the fact is,  
Of vast chicane, of course of practice  
But what profession can we trace  
Where some will not the corps disgrace  
A notice had to quit the world  
And from his desk at length was hurl’d  
Observe I pray the plain narration  
Twas in a hot & long vacation  
Where time he had but no assistance  
Tho great from Courts of Law the distance  
To reach the Courts of Truth & Justice  
(Where I confess my only trust is)  
Tho’ here below a learned pleader  
Shows talents worthy of a leader  
Yet must he his own fame support  
Be sometimes witty with the court  
Or work the passions of a jury  
With tender strains or full of fury  
Misleads them all tho’ twelve apostles  
While with new law the judge he jostles  
And makes them all give up their pow’rs  
To speeches of at least three hours.  
But we have left our little man  
And wandered from our purpos’d plan  
Tis said without ill-natured leaven  
<span data-tippy="If ever" class="green">That rarely</span> Lawyers get to heaven  
It surely is by slow degrees  
(Perhaps tis slow they take their fees)  
The case I now fairly state  
<span data-tippy="Flaw reach’d at length to Heaven’s high gate" class="green">Yet Flaw crept slyly to the heavenly gate</span>  
<span data-tippy="Quite spent her rapt" class="green">And gently knock’d</span>, none did it neater  
The gate was opened by Saint Peter  
Who look’d astonish’d when he saw  
All black, our little man of law,  
But charity was Peter’s guide,  
For having once himself denied  
His master, he would no o’er pass  
The penitent of any class,  
Yet never having heard there entered  
A lawyer, nay no one that ventured  
<span data-tippy="Within" class="green">So near</span> the realms of peace and love  
He told him mildly to remove,  
And would have clos’d the gate of day,  
Had not old Flaw in suppliant way,  
’Tis said without ill-natured leaven  
That lawyers rarely get to heaven  
And that the court of truth and justice  
To reach (in which our surest trust is)  
In barrister or special pleader  
Shews talents worthy of a leader  
Yet Flaw, the case I fairly state  
Continued to reach the heavenly gate  
And gently knock’d none did it neater  
Demuring at so hard a fate  
Begg’d but a look tho’ thro’ the gate  
St Peter rather off his guard  
Unwilling to be thought too hard  
Open’d the gate to let him peep in  
What did the lawyer? did he creep in?  
Or dash at once to take possession?  
Oh no, he knew his own profession  
He took his hat off with respect  
And would no gentle means neglect  
But finding it was all in vain  
For him admittance to obtain  
Thought it were best let come what will  
To gain admittance by his skill  
So while St Peter stood aside  
To let the gates be opened wide  
He shimm’d his hat with all his strength  
Wither the gate, to no small length  
St Peter stared the lawyer ask’d him  
“Only to fetch his hat” and passed him  
But when he reach’d the jack he’d thrown  
Oh! then was all the lawyer shown  
He clapp’d it on and, arms akimbo  
As if he’d been the gallant Bembo,  
Cried out what think you of my plan  
Eject me Peter if you can.
