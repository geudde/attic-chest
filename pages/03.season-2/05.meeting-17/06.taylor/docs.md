Right glad was I ere while to hear  
&emsp;My friend his kind intent with social warmth express  
His purpose soon to taste my cheer  
&emsp;And make my wine some bottles less.  
Since when of days full three times nine  
Are gone and still I keep my wine  
  
Chagrined, I late to Gifford hied  
&emsp;A sage deep-skill’d in antient lore  
My disappointment told and sigh’d  
&emsp;And begg’d the reason he’d explore  
“You ninny!” then the sage did say,  
“Why you forgot to name the day”  
  
(Learning how thy favourite son  
&emsp;Does every vulgar weight excel  
He sees the deed ere it is done  
&emsp;And eggs can guess, unseen the shell  
Soon as I heard this wise remark  
I found my soul no longer dark)   
  
“Get home,” he said, “and seize your pen  
And on a clear wire-woven sheet  
Of all you wish — the *where* and *when*  
In civil phrase distinctly treat  
And if you will, add this from me  
Dear George I’ll make your number three”  
  
Come then my reverend friend and cheer  
On Thursday next my lonely dome  
Nor doubt my stock of beef and beer  
Tho’ my good-woman’s far from home  
For still her care my household guides  
And though not here, she here presides  
  
Five be the hour and should we find  
Some trifles want her ruling eye  
The kindness of thy polished mind  
Shall every petty want supply  
Good nature in the well-bred guest  
Still of his welcome makes the feast
