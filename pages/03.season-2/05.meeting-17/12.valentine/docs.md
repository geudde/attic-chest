The clock has struck! the witching time of night!  
And now, St. Valentine asserts his right.  
First, close your eyes, nay do not be afraid.  
No roguish mischief shall to you be play’d,  
Now open them again, and her you first shall see,  
Is doom’d by fate, your Valentine to be!  
Salute her kindly, with a fair ‘good morrow’  
And from some antient bard a couplet borrow  
Which shall the lucky fair-one tell,  
It’s very late, and time to say farewell.
