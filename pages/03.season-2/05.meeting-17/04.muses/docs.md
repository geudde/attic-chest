<div class="author">Communicated by Mrs Flaxman</div>

Whether on Ida’s shady brow,  
Or in the chamber of the east,  
The chambers of the sun, that now  
From antient melody have ceas’d;  
  
Whether in heav’n ye wander fair,  
Or the green corners of the earth,  
Or the blue regions of the air;  
Where the melodious winds have birth.  
  
Whether on crystal rocks ye rove,  
Beneath the bosom of the sea  
Wand’ring in many a coral grove,  
Fair Nine, forsaking poetry!  
  
How have ye left the antient love  
That bards of old enjoy’d in you,  
The languid strings do scarcely move,  
The sound is forc’d, the notes are few!
