Monsieur L’Abbé de Grenthe  
Of the polite Academy  
&emsp;Will *give* a ball to brag on,  
And begs to state it will take place  
At that receptacle of grace  
&emsp;Th’ assembly soon at Dragon.  
  
Monsieur declares that this is meant  
Solely for friend’s encouragement.  
&emsp;So prays you to remember  
Trusting that all who hear the news may  
Not fail to meet him upon Tuesday,  
&emsp;The twelfth of this December.  
  
Variety the treat enhancer,  
Reels, minuets, jigs & country dances  
&emsp;His anxious care divide.  
Cossac, chantreuse, cotillon too,  
Tripudium, qu’est tout nouveau,  
&emsp;And many more beside.  
  
Much will be heard as well as seen,  
Speeches by Virgil and Racine  
&emsp;By Thompson, Homer, Home  
Effects de la poudra-a-canon!  
Cato, par Monsieur Addison,  
&emsp;Et “Condition de l’Homme”  
 
March, *Valentine*, Sylph Miss J. B.

&emsp;And many more you’ll hear,  
Ap Shenkin, Vertigo & Rondo,  
And what the ladies are so fond o’  
&emsp;The British Grenadier.  
  
In short the Abbé’s a man  
Resolved to please by this new plan.  
&emsp;What mortal can say more!!  
Tickets at three & sixpence each  
Are had, where Monsieur *deigns* to be  
&emsp;Tea paid for at the door —
