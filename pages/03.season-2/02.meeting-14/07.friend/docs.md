Oh! how tenacious memory loves to dwell  
On every scene where I have stray’d with thee!  
’Tis she distinguishes each leafy tree,  
Each grassy lane — for thy sake lov’d so well!  
More dear to me she makes the sea-beat shore —  
She tells how after I’ve been with thee there:  
And when I turn the page to soothe my care,  
Still she reminds whence thou wert wont to quote.  
And to my soul she trills each tuneful note,  
And every accent I shall hear no more!  
&emsp;How have I blest her, when, with magic pow’r,  
To past delight she’s been my guiding friend —  
To what deep anguish does her office tend  
When I contrast it with the present hour!
