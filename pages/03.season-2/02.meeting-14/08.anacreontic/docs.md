<div class="author">Mr Flaxman</div>

Tell not dull Sophist thy long tale of Fate,  
And Chaos wild — I care not for their date,  
I’ve tun’d my Lyre in praise of Love,  
And all the immortal joys above:  
And as my fingers dance among the trembling strings  
&emsp;I’ll sing of sparkling Wine  
&emsp;And Cupid’s golden wings.  
	
Anacreonides
