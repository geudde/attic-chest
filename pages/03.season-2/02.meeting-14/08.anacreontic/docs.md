<div class="author">Mr Flaxman</div>

Tell not dull Sophist thy long tale of fate,  
And chaos wild — I care not for their date,  
I’ve tun’d my lyre in praise of love,  
And all the immortal joys above:  
And as my fingers dance among the trembling strings  
&emsp;I’ll sing of sparkling wine  
&emsp;And Cupid’s golden wings.  
	
Anacreonides
