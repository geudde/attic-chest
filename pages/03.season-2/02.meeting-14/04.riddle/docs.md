Four people sat down at a tavern to play  
They play’d all the night, and some part of next day  
This one thing observe — from the time they were seated  
Nobody play’d with them, and nobody betted  
Yet, when they left off, each was gainer a Guinea  
Who guesses this riddle, I’m sure is no ninny.
