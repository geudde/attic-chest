Hail solitary Chimney! peeping white  
‘Mid the dark trees, I hail thy sight,  
Thou harbinger of comfort, & of rest,  
By ev’ry weary Traveller confest:  
But chiefly, He, who long has left his Home,  
Returning, sees from far the tranquil dome;  
How does his heart with strong emotions glow,  
When gazing wistful on the Dale below,  
He sees the curling vapour reach the skies,  
Which from his dear paternal Chimney flies;  
What lovely pictures then doth Mem’ry trace  
Filling the circle with each dear lov’d face,  
He sees his Mother, & his chearful Sire,  
His blooming Sisters, round the social fire.  
And who is she so pensive, yet so young?  
Who on a Portrait o’er the Chimney hung  
Gazes with tender smile & glist’ning Eye?  
While her fair bosom gently breathes a sigh.  
Ah ‘tis the chosen Maiden of his heart,  
His cherish’d Love, his Hope, his better part.  
Now swifter than before he moves along,  
While hopes & fears his beating bosom throng,  
He clears the well known stile with nimble bound,  
And like the Swallow seems to skim the ground.  
How glows his cheek, with hope & joy elate,  
When turning quick, he sees the garden gate,  
The watchful Dog, the family alarms,  
And all in breathless joy he rushes to their arms!
