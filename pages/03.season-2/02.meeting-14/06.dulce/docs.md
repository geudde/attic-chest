Hail solitary chimney! peeping white  
’Mid the dark trees, I hail thy sight,  
Thou harbinger of comfort, & of rest,  
By ev’ry weary traveller confessed:  
But chiefly, he, who long has left his home,  
Returning, sees from far the tranquil dome;  
How does his heart with strong emotions glow,  
When gazing wistful on the dale below,  
He sees the curling vapour reach the skies,  
Which from his dear paternal chimney flies;  
What lovely pictures then doth mem’ry trace  
Filling the circle with each dear lov’d face,  
He sees his mother, & his cheerful sire,  
His blooming sisters, round the social fire.  
And who is she so pensive, yet so young?  
Who on a portrait o’er the chimney hung  
Gazes with tender smile & glist’ning eye?  
While her fair bosom gently breathes a sigh.  
Ah ’tis the chosen maiden of his heart,  
His cherish’d love, his hope, his better part.  
Now swifter than before he moves along,  
While hopes & fears his beating bosom throng,  
He clears the well known stile with nimble bound,  
And like the swallow seems to skim the ground.  
How glows his cheek, with hope & joy elate,  
When turning quick, he sees the garden gate,  
The watchful dog, the family alarms,  
And all in breathless joy he rushes to their arms!
