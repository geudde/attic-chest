Lately come from fairy land  
To a world unknown to me —  
Leaving fancy’s fairy band,  
Leaving skyborn liberty,  
Leaving all — ’tis thee I seek  
Ellen, pride of maidens fair!  
Hear me while I whisp’ring speak  
Gentle love’s propitious prayer:  
  
May thy morn of life be past  
Fragrant as the month of May,  
Every year be like the last  
Happy healthfull sportive gay,  
May the laughter loving dame  
Teach to charm and reach to please,  
And Minerva’s sacred flame  
Learning add, to polish’d ease;  
May thy heart to pity prone  
Sweetly soothing others’ woes,  
Still reserve for one alone  
All that love and truth bestows:  
  
This thy life to virtue true  
Long an even course shall run,  
And content with roseate hue  
Softly tinge thy setting sun,  
Tinge thy sun with golden rays,  
When ev’ning’s life is ebbing fast,  
Glowing hopes of future days,  
Sweet reflexions on the past.
