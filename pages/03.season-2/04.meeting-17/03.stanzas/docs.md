The following Stanzas upon Terror and Pity are taken from a small Quarto Pamphlet published about 60 or 70 years ago since entitled: “Melpomene; or the Regions of Terror and Pity” in which the Poet speaking in the first Person describes the various Images exciting Terror or Pity —

A Rambler

The first Extracts are taken from the part entitled

#### Terror

(cause by Anger)

Ha! what is he whose fierce indignant eye,
&emsp;Denouncing vengeance, kindles into flame?
Whose boisterous fury blows a Storm so high,
&emsp;As with its thunder shakes his labouring frame.
&emsp;&emsp;What can such rage provoke?
&emsp;&emsp;His words their passage choke:
&emsp;His eager Steps, nor time nor truce allow,
And dreadful dangers wait the menace of his brow.

(and Jealousy)

Before my wondering sense new phantoms dance,
&emsp;And stamp their horrid shapes upon my brain —
A wretch with jealous brow, and eyes askance,
&emsp;Feeds all in secret on his bosom pain.
&emsp;&emsp;Fond love, fierce hate, assail;
&emsp;&emsp;Alternate they prevail:
&emsp;While conscious pride and shame with rage conspire,
And urge the latent spark to flames of torturing fire

#### Pity

(caused by another’s Grief)

Behold that beauteous Maid! her languid head
Bends like a drooping lily charg’d with rain
With floods of tears she bathes a lover dead
&emsp;In brave assertion of her honour slain
&emsp;&emsp;Her bosom heaves with sighs
&emsp;&emsp;To heaven she lifts her eyes
&emsp;With grief beyond the power of words exprest
Smiles on the lifeless corse and dies upon his breast.
