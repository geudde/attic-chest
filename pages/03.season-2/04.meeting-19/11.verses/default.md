The Author having been invited to breakfast with these Ladies absurdly imagined that 10 o’clock would not be too early to see them; but unfortunately he was mistaken, and obliged to wait in a cold room by an ill-lighted smoky fire for near two hours, when quite impatient, he prevailed on the Servant to disturb them with the following Address  
  
Ah! why should Ladies formed to please  
&emsp;With every charm of wit and beauty,  
Seduced by listless love of ease  
&emsp;Thus deviate from the path of duty;  
And when yon Sun, that shines so bright,  
&emsp;Enlivens earth and all brute natures  
Obscure those brighter Suns in Night,  
&emsp;Ordained t’enliven two-legg’d creatures.  
Alas! that Sun, perceives your crime  
&emsp;And hides his head in clouds for sorrow  
And will not, ‘till another time  
&emsp;Be seen — perchance not till tomorrow.  
Cruel! not such the dames of old —  
&emsp;When days were long and nights much shorter  
*They* rose with Knights and Barons bold,  
&emsp;And breakfasted on Beef and Porter.  
And ere the Cock’s voice rouse the morn,  
&emsp;On milk-white Palfreys proudly riding  
To chase the Deer with hound and horn,  
&emsp;Sprang forth their tardy Lover’s chiding;  
While you regardless of my pain  
&emsp;Benumbed with cold, with hunger dying  
Regardless of sagacious Jane  
&emsp;And prattling Charles for <span data-tippy="Illegible" class="red">[???]</span> crying  
Forgetful too, that lazy maids  
&emsp;Are self-condemned to wear the willow  
You sleep and snore as if your heads  
&emsp;Some witch had bound fast to your pillow.  
Oh break, Sweet Girls, the bonds of sleep! —  
&emsp;All blooming as I oft have seen you,  
Descend — or to your couch I’ll creep  
&emsp;And warm my frozen limbs between you.
