#### Doubt

![Doubt](doubt.jpg?resize=300)

Ah, who can tell the Grief and ruthless pain  
&emsp;That rends the bosom of that hapless Wight  
Whom Doubt assails; the tortur’d wretch in vain  
&emsp;In crouds and noise would shun the hellish sprite?  
Ne comely dames in Sattin’s richly dight  
&emsp;Their Cheeks with love’s warm blushes overspread  
Ne song ne jocund dance can yield delight  
&emsp;Eft does he stamp and swear and scratch his head  
Ne can he sleep anights ne keep his Bum abed,  
  
A thousand spectres grim around him flee  
&emsp;Their dark surmises buzzing in his ear  
“See here thy caitiff foe” — nay — now ’tis he  
&emsp;Now this now that the truth still never near  
And then the spectres laugh and mock and jeer  
&emsp;In vain he bids to bring the dinner in  
And generous wine his heavy Heart to cheer  
&emsp;Alas he has no stomach to begin —  
Sans Sleep — Sans drink — sans prog no wonder he’s so thin  
  
#### Certainty

But when the Cherub certainly arrives  
&emsp;Like Phoebus bursting from a radiant cloud;  
Eftsoons away the hellish troop he drives  
&emsp;And all the Terrors of that cursed croud  
And now he sings and leaps and laughs aloud  
&emsp;To find an Antient friend his fancied foe  
And of his presence not a little proud  
&emsp;At first he greets him with a courteous bow  
Then turns him round and round and kisses high and low.  
  
And now the Tonser turns his fragrant hair  
And new fresh water makes his face to shine  
And now he toys and prattles with the fair  
And with keen stomach maketh haste to dine  
And now he quaffs full bowls of luscious wine  
And he ’gins to Wag and double Chin  
And talks of sleeping undisturb’d till nine  
While honest joy is blazon’d in his eyne  
That marketh gentle peace a settled Guest within.
