<div class="author">Miss Vardill[^1]</div>

Poor little Moth, how low thou’rt laid!  
Would thou hadst never thoughtless play’d  
Round yon seducing *light*,  
And flutter’d in its magic beam  
Like one enchanted in a dream  
Or vision of <span data-tippy="delight" class="green">the night</span>.

No more will’t thou poor hapless fly  
Thy little airy pinions ply  
In gay and sportive guise,  
For scorch’d and sullied on the ground  
Thy downy breast, thy wings are found  
Poor Moth <span data-tippy="ne’er" class="green">no</span> more to rise!

Thus many a self-deluded Maid  
By love’s soft brilliancy betray’d  
Pursues the glitt’ring prize,  
Finding too late, that she has prest  
Destructive flame within her breast  
Sinks like the Moth, and dies!
