#### Answer to the Query: In what Country are occasionally found Cherry-coloured Cats with Rose-coloured feet?

In England’s happy Land we sometimes find,  
That curious Species of the Feline kind;  
Their Skins are *sable* as the ripen’d Guine [^1]  
And like a milky-rose each foot is seen.  

Kindly say my dearest Nell  
If your ‘Riddle’ right I tell,  
Surely, *That* will rhyme to *this*,  
Scold me, if I judge amiss.
