Sir Mulciber that goldsmith great  
Must be a thoughtless fellow,  
To send in such unfinish’d state  
The Box to Tinderella.

Promethean fire snatches,  
Has quite forgotten in his haste   
To store the Box with matches!

And <span data-tippy="that you’ll" class="green">what you may</span>call a Paradox  
That though <span data-tippy="it may not be compleat" class="green">Though with matches stored, it still</span>  
<span data-tippy="’Tis yet" class="green">Would be</span> a _Matchless_ Tinderbox!
