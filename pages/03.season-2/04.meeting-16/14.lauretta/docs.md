The moon’s fair face begins to shew  
Kissing the distant mountain’s brow,  
And ev’ry twinkling star on high,  
Peeps from her window in the sky;  
Swift along the silver tide  
See the little vessel glide;  
Now they drop the splashing oar  
Now they touch the verdant shore,  
Beneath the castle’s shadowy wall  
Near the turret brown and tall,  
There within a nook obscure  
Now the little bark they moor,  
No sound is heard along the vale  
But the plaintive nightingale  
And the water’s gentle flow  
Murm’ring thro’ the reeds below.  
  
Thus, spoke Lauretta, lovely maid,  
When lo! emerging from the shade  
A stranger, like a pilgrim clad  
And follow’d by a minstrel lad  
Approach’d the lady’s bower so fair  
Directed by the taper’s glare.  
Across the minstrel’s shoulder hung  
A lute, to which he sweetly sung  
“Lady, here beneath your window  
Two poor weary pilgrims stand,  
Seven long years we have been absent  
Wand’rers in the Holy Land;  
Give us shelter ’till the morning  
Sure to pity is not wrong.  
He with pray’rs will pay your kind  
I, will cheer you with a song.”  
Here the fair Lauretta sigh’d,  
And bade the gate be open’d wide,  
Welcome shall the pilgrim be  
Doubly welcome unto me!  
And then the lady sigh’d again  
As tho’ she felt a secret pain.  
For none, of Palestine could sing  
But to her heart would mem’ry bring,  
A gentle, yet a valiant knight  
Who seeking glory in the fight  
Had join’d a brave, a christian band  
And journey’d to the Holy Land,  
Had won the palm of many a field,  
Had taught full many a foe to yield.  
And soon Lauretta hop’d to see  
Her love return with victory;  
But yet a tear would dim her eye  
And yet her bosom heave a sigh  
When any tongue that land should name  
Or sing of warriors and their fame.  
And now, the younger damsels press  
Around the youth in minstrel dress,  
While those sedate and grave, did scan,  
The pilgrim, venerable man.  
But kindly all the maidens vie  
In sweet attentive courtesy  
Delicious viands, gen’rous wine  
Their pow’rful forces soon combine  
Rekindling spirits they bestow,  
The minstrel’s cheek begins to glow,  
No longer weary pale and mute,  
He takes his half-forgotten lute;  
And softly running o’er the strings  
He tries an air then thus he sings:

> “Lady will you hear a story  
> Of a young and gallant knight  
> How he liv’d in Andalusia  
> How he woo’d a lady bright.”  
>   
> “Lovely as the spring’s fair morning  
> Was the lady of his heart  
> Goodness all her charms adorning  
> She was beauty’s better part.”  
>   
> “Long their hearts had been united  
> Fortune smil’d upon their love,  
> But ere yet their vows were plighted  
> Fate their constancy did prove.”  
> 
> “Now the ven’trous brave crusaders  
> Rais’d the Christian banner high,  
> All the youth of Spain desired  
> In this cause their arms to try.”  
>   
> “Often did this lady weeping  
> Pray her lover to remain  
> But her timid fond persuasion  
> Tears and sighs were all in vain;”  
>   
> “For tho’ each sad drop of sorrow  
> Cost his manly heart a sigh  
> He must glory’s footsteps follow  
> Nor heed the tear in beauty’s eye.”  
>   
> “Now in distant climes a ranger  
> Far from his affianc’d bride  
> Still he seeks the post of danger  
> St Iago be his guide!”  
>   
> “Here I might of battles telling  
> Turn the cheek of beauty pale  
> But were pity’s self is dwelling  
> Must I tell so sad a tale?”  
>   
> “Yes where’er the brave commander  
> Fights against his sanguine foes  
> Of his valiant deeds recorded  
> Still his faithful minstrel goes.”  
>   
> “Now arrives the fatal morning  
> All the martial troops are met,  
> Sun beams gold their rich adorning  
> Sad and dark that sun will set!”  
>   
> “Who shall tell the noble daring  
> Of the Christian youth that day  
> And the many brave Hidalgo’s  
> On the dreadful plain that lay!”  
>   
> “And who shall tell the gentle lady  
> Fairest sweetest flow’r of Spain  
> That her noble Don Alonzo  
> On that fatal day was slain?”  
  
Hold! Minstrel hold! your song give o’er  
The lady faints! Ah sing no more!  
The frighten’d maidens round her throng  
And blame the minstrel and his song.  
The pilgrim now before them prest  
And clasp’d the fair one to his breast  
Then falling lowly at her feet  
Calls on her name in accents sweet.  
At that lov’d voice the maid revives  
She sees her dear Alonzo lives!  
  
Hope’s rosy dawn illumes Lauretta’s cheek  
And smiles through tears her heart’s soft transports speak  
The pilgrim’s cloak and staff are thrown aside  
And the sad maid, becomes a joyful bride.
