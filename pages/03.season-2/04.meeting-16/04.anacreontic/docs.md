As I sat musing in my bow’r,  
Pleas’d with each whistling bird,  
Enamor’d of each flow’r,  
Lo! a warrior’s form is seen,  
Darting resplendent rays across the green.  
His starry helmet beaming light  
His full orb’d buckler, blazing bright,  
’Twas I thought the God of War,  
Just descended from his car.  
But what have I to do with him?  
I’ll fill a goblet to the brim.  
“Here Mars,” I cried, “since thou are come  
Partake Evoke’s foaming boon,”  
But as to raise the cup I tried  
With the radiant arms,  
Prostrate I fell before her charms  
I spilt the wine then tumbled down  
Thy golden cup and ivy crown.  
She bowed her head  
Then stretch’d her lovely hand  
And smiling said,  
“Fear nor my gentle votary  
I subdue  
Fierce Mars, as easy  
As I conquer you.”  
  
Anacreonides
