#### Lines addressed to a Gentleman on his Birthday with the Return of his Ingenious and Amusing Poems
  
#### 1  
  
&emsp;Inspir’d by your charming lines,  
&emsp;Where wit resplendent ever shines,  
And numerous beauties play;  
&emsp;I seize my Pen, but half afraid,  
&emsp;First call the Muses to my aid,  
To hail your natal Day.  
  
#### 2  
  
&emsp;May ev’ry comfort here below,  
&emsp;That Man can ask or God bestow,  
Attend throughout your life;  
&emsp;Blest in your Children’s rip’ning years,  
&emsp;May you ne’er suffer carking cares,  
Blest too in such a Wife.  
  
#### 3  
  
&emsp;Long may your verses pleasure give,  
&emsp;Increasing always while you live,  
And swell the genial page;  
&emsp;May they still ever witty be,  
&emsp;And while they flow in Number free,  
Instruct and please the age.  
  
B.R.
