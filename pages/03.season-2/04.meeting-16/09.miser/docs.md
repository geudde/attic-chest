A Miser, traversing his house  
Espied, unusual there, a mouse,  
And thus his uninvited guest,  
Briskly inquisitive, address’d:  
“Tell me, my dear, to what cause is it  
I owe this unexpected visit?”  
The Mouse her Host obliquely eyed,  
And smiling, pleasantly replied:  
“Fear not, good fellow! for your hoard  
I come to lodge, and not to board.”
