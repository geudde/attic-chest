<span class="title">Turk  </span>
  
I just come from Turkey and fain Sir would know  
What you English mean by a devilish good row.  
  
<span class="title">Englishman  </span>
  
It is bawling O—P— and barking like dogs  
With sounding of bugles and croaking like frogs  
Dustman’s bells ringing, and springing of rattles  
Blowing of coach horns and acting sham battles  
Hissing and stamping, at managers moaning,  
Chronicle cheering — at gilded post groaning  
Whistles and catcalls, and a large sheet of paper  
Roll’d broad at one end, at t’other made taper  
Which blown thro’ in style, most harmoniously growls,  
Then screaming like parrots, and hooting like owls  
The mewing of cats, the shrieks of scared lasses,  
Neighing like horses, and braying like asses  
Shouting *“Clifford & Ridley & Winholt for ever”*  
*“Support Great King George but Jack Kemble never.”*  
Against private boxes raising up placards  
Turning out jews and all manager’s blackguards  
*“No Runners from Bow Street”* loud rapping with sticks  
*“No engines, no trap doors — off — off no stage tricks”*  
Fencing and marching, with kicking and prancing  
Over the benches to O—P— time dancing  
*“No private boxes — no ruffians on hire”*  
John Bull to insult should he O—P— require  
With sneezing and laughing with crowing and coughing  
Then *“What do you want”* at managers scoffing  
In a playhouse these sounds united I vow  
*Make* a *most* glorious, a *devilish* good row.
