When mighty Ferdinand insanely grave  
Would neither wash his hands, or shave;  
Nor olio taste, nor soup, nor jelly,  
His faithful consort sunk in grief,  
When every saint denied relief  
Thus pray’d to Farinelli —  
Sweet Farinelli swell your throat,  
And pour some soft bewitching note  
&emsp;My dear Italian bug,  
Each frantic passion which commands,  
Then squall, till Feddy wash his hands  
&emsp;And shove, look spruce, & smug —  
Hark! Farinelli squeaks to please her,  
Oh Don Diego fetch the razor  
&emsp;From yonder golden case,  
Diego runs elate with hope,  
Lathers his chops with Castile soap  
&emsp;And trims the sov’reign’s face.  

The king arose without a speck,  
Bess flings her arms around his neck,  
&emsp;Perfumed and free from dirt,  
Again in regal state he dines  
In royal robes superbly shines  
&emsp;And wears a nice clean shirt.  
The mighty master smiled to see  
That love was in the next degree,  
&emsp;And sung Eliza’s charms,  
The king admired each new-born grace,  
With rapture, view’d her beauteous face,  
&emsp;And sank into her arms!  
Thus Farinelli’s soothing strain  
Lulled the wild tempest of his brain;  
&emsp;No more his senses riot,  
So when the frantic ocean raves  
A pint of oil will still the waves  
&emsp;And all is calm and quiet.
