From Helicon, ye sacred Nine descend  
And to my call an ear propitious lend  
Though with weak hand, I trembling touch the lyre  
Though small my portion of poetic fire  
Let me not ask your heavenly aid in vain  
To fire my soul, and animate my strain  
Yourselves I sing, when from Parnassus height  
To the bright sun you steered your arduous flight  
From him who rules our system, to request  
His partial favour for your Attic Chest  
Then let my song confess your fire divine  
To meet my subject, animate my line  
When Jove no longer ruled this nether world  
And from their throne th’ Olympian gods were hurled  
To planets turned they graced the vault of heaven  
Still to revolve in measured circles given  
While in each orb a guardian power presides,  
And through the blue expanse its motion guides  
But all the fay who rules the sun, obey  
Myriads of sprites confess his sovereign sway  
Some rule the varying seasons of the year  
Some bid the day and some the night appear  
Some mark the paths in which the comets roll  
Some guide the slow rotation of the pole  
One o’er the force of gravity presides  
And rules the varying motions of the tides  
Acts on the planets with attractive force  
And regulates their oscillating course  
One bids the meteors own his sovereign sway  
And electricity his laws obey  
The elements are to four sprites consigned  
To thousand more are various tasks assigned  
Of all the heathen gods, the tuneful Nine  
Alone retain their ancient rank divine  
Still o’er the walks of poetry command  
And bid the flowers of literature expand  
From other regions chased by war’s alarms  
Where peace and freedom still display their charms  
In Britain’s isle — they fixed their happy reign  
And loved and honoured, fire each poet’s strain  
With tuneful art they raise each song sublime  
Fixed to withstand the envious tooth of time  
On all around their valued favours shed  
And crown with laurel each poetic head,  
But most their tuneful influence shines confest  
In all the votaries of the Attic Chest  
Whene’er they wish, the favouring Nine descend  
Whene’er they call, their call the Nymphs attend  
Bid Genius, Learning, mould the rising line  
“And all the Graces crown the bright design”  
While rosy Summer makes our Isle his seat  
In Groves the Nine elude his scorching heat  
On Pastoral themes their heavenly Lyres employ  
While natives Echoes to their strains reply  
When winter comes they quit the rural plain  
In London reassance their Ancient reign  
And in the Attic Chest their dwelling make  
Refreshed by sleep the Guardian Genii wake  
While all the votaries of the sacred Chest  
Shake off the shackles of inglorious rest  
Prompt at their call the Nine their gifts dispense  
On all around, the readings recommence  
Meanwhile, the fair Pierides afraid  
Lest Time should undermine the work they’d made  
Swift to the Fay presiding in the sun  
Thro’ the blue Ether their bright course begun  
Him to propitiate, from him request  
Unfading honours for their Attic Chest  
That ever fresh by his binignant doom  
Th’ immortal laurels of its fame might bloom  
So where in Pisces now the sun appeared  
Their flights the Nymphs thro’ the bright Zodiac steer’d  
The Earth in Virgo quickly left behind  
And to Libra thence their course inclined  
The fair Urania leads the virgin band  
Her golden Lyre resplendent in her hand  
Which, when she strikes th’ enraptured poet hears  
Or seems to hear the Music of the Spheres  
Her robe was blue, and thickly spangled o’er  
Like Stars the rich refulgent crown she wore  
To her Calliope the next succeeds  
With air majestical the Nymph proceeds  
Her gold embroidered robe loose flowed behind  
In graceful folds or wantoned in the wind  
Twined in her golden Coronet was seen  
The Bay, the Laurel with its glossy green  
With Laurel eke her sacred Lyre was bound  
Which when she struck would heavenly tones respond  
But seldom has she given a mortal’s ear  
The fulness of its magic sound to hear  
The Bard who sung Laertes son renowned  
And Troy’s proud walls now level with the ground  
First heard the strain his emulative song  
Poured like a torrent, bold energic, strong  
The Mantuan next, whose ears attentive caught  
The flowing richness of its softer note  
The Briton last whose highly gifted mind  
Their separate beauties in himself combined  
Who seized his Lyre, with sacred ardour fired  
And e’en to sing of heavenly themes aspired  
But few besides have heard that heavenly sound  
Or but a moment its blest influence found  
Though the fair nymph with its harmonious note  
Will sometimes bless the modern ear of Scott  
With brisker step the next Erato came  
And with Calliope’s her garb the same  
With Myrtle mixed the bay composed her crown  
Her radiant Lyre was wreathed with Bay alone  
And to its varying note alike belong  
The Ode sublime, or softer pastoral song,  
Sometimes the sound would reach the vault of heaven  
Sometimes to fill the Stygian wilds was given  
Next came Melpomene the Tragic Maid,  
In Cypress crown, and sable vest, arrayed;  
Stately in grief, the Nymph incessant mourned,  
Her Ebon Lyre a plaintive sound returned.  
Buskined her feet, her zone, a dagger wore,  
Her hand a masque of Tragic features bore.  
Thalia next was gaily smiling seen  
Her sister, but unlike in form and mien:  
Wit shone resplendent in her laughing eye  
With blameless Mirth, Keen Jest, and Humour sly.  
Still as she went she changed her varying vest,  
And in the Sock, her graceful feet were drest.  
In Sprightly strains her Lyre’s gay notes would flow  
Nor e’er its strings returned a sound of woe.  
Her masque was gay with mingled grins and smiles  
With gibing Satire and successful wiles.  
Next Clio came, she, who in every age,  
Guides the composer of the Historic page,  
In simple garb of spotless white arrayed  
With laurel crowned was seen th’ immortal maid,  
In her fair hand her pen and scroll appear,  
Her Lyre gave tones, harmonious, simple, clear.  
Next Polyhymnia, who with pleasing art  
Could tame the fierce and melt th’ obdurate heart,  
Could bid the tears of genuine pity flow,  
To ease the widow, or the Orphan’s woe,  
Or cause the generous breast to boil with ire  
O’er the cold body of the slaughtered sire  
Inflame the mind with love of War’s alarms,  
Or bend the stubborn heart to pleasure’s charms.  
Fraught with such power, the high bequest of heaven  
To her the Lyre, by Vulcan framed was given;  
With plants of various kinds her Shell was bound,  
With Cypress, Parsley, Oak, her head was crowned.  
Last in the train those two fair Nymphs appear,  
Who make the sympathy of sound their care;  
Terpsichore her Lyre, Euterpe bore  
Her flute, of Bay, were formed the crowns they wore.  
Thus in fair order the immortal Nine  
Through the bright belt described a radiant line  
As when some meteor in the kindling air  
Shews his bright face and shakes his burning hair  
Fools portending bloody wars and woe,  
And plagues and tempests to the Earth below  
Thus with such Light the lovely Muses shone,  
In their swift course through the celestial zone.  
While on its light the wise admiring gaze  
Lost in conjecture whence the wanderer strays  
If from the Moon it draws its radiant birth  
Or vapours rising from the heated Earth  
Which mingled in the higher realms of air  
Its solid mass ignited now appear.
