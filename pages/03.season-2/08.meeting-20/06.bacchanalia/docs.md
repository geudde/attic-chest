Sweet Iser! were thy sunny realm  
&emsp;And flowing fountains mine  
My waters I would shade with elm  
&emsp;To prop the tender bine  
My golden Flaggons I would fill  
With rosy draughts from every hill  
&emsp;And underneath green spreading bower  
My gay companions should prolong  
The Feast! the revel! and the song!  
&emsp;To many a sportive hour.  
 
Like rivers, crimson’d by the beam  
Of yonder planet bright  
Our nectar cups should ever stream  
Profusion of delight  
No care should touch the mellow heart  
And sad, or sober, none depart  
For wine can triumph over woe  
And Love & Bacchus brother powers  
Should build in Iser’s sunny bowers  
A Paradise below.
