Wake, dearest Infant, wake, Birds carol gay,  
And ev’ry dewy flow’r proclaims the May,  
Ope they sweet eyes Love, to behold the day  
&emsp;And give me joy;  
For not ’till I can bless their gentle light  
Shall I be sure the golden Sun is bright:  
While thou are sunk in sleep, it still is night  
&emsp;My darling Boy.  

Smile sweetest Baby in thy Mother’s face,  
And while thus soften’d into infant grace  
Thy Father’s lineaments mind eye can trace  
&emsp;I sigh with joy!  
Ah, now I see the little dimple sleek  
Lurking amid the roses of thy cheek,  
Its polis’d smoothness gently thus to break  
&emsp;My lovely Boy.  
  
And can a Mother know more joy than this?  
A joy more exquisite, more pure, O yes!  
’Tis the proud Climax of the Mother’s bliss  
&emsp;To hear her Boy  
In new-born accents, infantine, and sweet,  
Caught from her lips, his Father’s name repeat  
Delightful sound! her gladden’d ear to greet,  
&emsp;Oh *this* is joy.
