Gentle Stella sweetly shine  
With mild refulgent ray  
On your benighted Valentine  
For he has lost his way!  

For ever I would circling play  
Around my Stella’s head  
Nor wish to meet a brighter day  
Than from her Eye is shed!  
  
But ah! incautious vent’rous thing  
Ah silly! silly Fly!  
For ever now, you scorch your Wing  
Go nearer, and you Die!  
  
Moth
