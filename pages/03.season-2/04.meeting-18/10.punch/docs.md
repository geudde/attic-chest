If gifts the stern fair one to pity can move  
Their power at this time let your Valentine prove  
At the suit of Poor Punch, Eborina relent  
For say what more *rich* can a Lover present.  
If your heart may be moved or by honours or gold  
On the top of my Offering a crown you behold  
Let the Flag that waves o’er it your canopy make  
And untouched you have still a most noble plumb cake  
Where fruits from all countries are mixed in a paste  
That must surely delight any damsel of *taste*  
Then let it your mind to compassion incline  
And allow at the least I’m a *sweet* Valentine.
