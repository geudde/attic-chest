All hail! thou kind soother of numberless woes,  
Which in Life’s early day, my companion I chose  
Which to Life’s latest gasp I shall ever regard  
For its noblest exertions, the minds great reward:  
Contracted indeed, without thee, were the fame  
Attending the Hero’s and Patriot’s name,  
Thy force, in mankind’s individual sphere  
Friends, Parents, and kindred, are bound to revere  
Tho’ doomed e’en through life in our Persons to sever  
Th’intelligent Mind, may find comfort for ever.  
What is it can soften the parting of those  
In whose bosoms the fondest affection e’er glows  
What is it the kind-hearted Lover can cheer  
When torn from the object to him the most dear,  
When Oceans loud roaring, between them may roll  
And <span data-tippy="when" class="green">as</span> distant, perhaps as <span data-tippy="each globular" class="green">from her to the</span> Pole  
What in absence can cheer him again, and again  
But Hope’s welcome prop and preserver, the Pen:  
It enlivens a desert, gives vigour to health  
And in poverty proves e’en a species of wealth,  
It is, whether slowly or quickly time rolls  
Th’indissolvable tie of congenial Souls.
