It is with a mingled sensation of pleasure and regret that the Editor discharges the last duty of his office this season by making his own and the Editresses acknowledgements to the correspondents of the Attic Chest for their numerous and excellent communications during a Session of nearly eight months, and by adjourning the meetings of the Society to a future day of which notice in due form will be given. The number of the communications in the list that has been made in a splendid testimony of the zeal and spirit with which the society has been supported and their excellence has been unequivocally acknowledged by the mirth excited or the praises voluntarily given when they were respectively read. These praises and the remembrance of the pleasures received we hope will stimulate our friends to new exertions, to be hereafter rewarded by greater delight and equally well minded applause. If the Editor might presume to suggest any thing to the members of the Society it would be that during the recess those who have leisure would direct their attention to collect fresh materials for the Winterâ€™s contest, and particularly that they would aim at compositions of a higher nature, more systematic, and more extensive in their plan. The Fancy and Facility which many of them have displayed sufficiently proves that their powers are equal to projects that would compell the praises of the most fastidious Critics and secure them a Reputation with Posterity among the first of our Poets.  
  
It only remains for the Editor in conjunction with the society to present our thanks to the Governess for her unremitting attentions to our entertainment and convivial Felicity and to the Editress for the spirit and good humour with which she has discharged the laborious duties of Reader and Commentator. We are assured that all will unite with us, on this her Birthday, in wishes that she may, many, many, years enjoy the same health and hilarity of disposition that she may never have amusement less innocent, less praiseworthy and improving, than her labours for the Attic Society, and that in the higher avocations of Life all her exertions may be attended with equal Happiness to herself and all around her.
