Oh luckless maid! Oh cruel fate  
&emsp;Would I might run away  
And shun ere it may be too late  
A subtle, dark, mysterious mate  
&emsp;Not made of mortal clay.  
  
Some call him Monarch of the Mine  
&emsp;Who claims this plighted hand  
That every thing superb and fine  
For which many ladies pine  
&emsp;Are all at his command  
  
But what to me are rubies rare,  
&emsp;Or sparkling diamond comb  
Or topaz crescent for my hair  
When not a soul will ere be there  
&emsp;But that detested gnome!  
  
For never any well drest belle  
&emsp;To ask could I presume  
No lower to my humid cell  
Just like a bucket in a well  
&emsp;And spoil her gay costume!  
  
Oh! if the thief some sylph had been  
&emsp;Tho’ ne’er so gay and light  
And proffer’d me to *his* Queen  
His golden wings, his sportive mien  
&emsp;Had won his heart outright!
