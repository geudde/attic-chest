Oh luckless Maid! Oh cruel fate  
&emsp;Would I might run away  
And shun ere it may be too late  
A subtle, dark, mysterious mate  
&emsp;Not made of Mortal Clay.  
  
Some call him Monarch of the Mine  
&emsp;Who claims this plighted hand  
That every thing superb and fine  
For which many Ladies pine  
&emsp;Are all at his command  
  
But what to me are rubies rare,  
&emsp;Or sparkling diamond comb  
Or Topaz Crescent for my hair  
When not a Soul will ere be there  
&emsp;But that detested Gnome!  
  
For never any well drest Belle  
&emsp;To ask could I presume  
No lower to my humid Cell  
Just like a Bucket in a Well  
&emsp;And spoil her gay costume!  
  
Oh! if the Thief some Sylph had been  
&emsp;Tho’ ne’er so gay and light  
And proffer’d me to *his* Queen  
His golden wings, his sportive mien  
&emsp;Had won his Heart outright!
