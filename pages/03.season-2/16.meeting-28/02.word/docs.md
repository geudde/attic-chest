I thought my good Sir, but I find I was wrong,  
And my inference truly absurd,  
That you hoped I had come to the [end] of my Song  
Which in truth you had found already too long,  
And that *you* wish’d *to have* the *Last Word*.  
  
And pray have you not by your Malice propense  
My Anger tremendous incurr’d?  
You’ve extinguish’d my light, made the Atmosphere dense,  
Then how can you think thus bereav’d of a Sense  
I can *“Manage”* to ***give*** the Last Word?  
  
Of our whimsical Charter you seem the Defender  
To the Lady this ne’er had occurr’d,  
But alas! should the Muse not deign to befriend her  
This Charter to you she will quickly surrender  
And still ask of you, The *Last Word*.  
  
As this subject to quit you don’t give permission  
And disputing you still have preferr’d  
I will venture to write, and prescribe as Physician  
Not to yours, but *my* Sex, the use of *Submission*  
Which should ever be *Woman’s Last Word*.
