#### The Spirit of the Attic Chest’s Farewell Address to the Editress  
  
With deep regret I view the season o’er  
&emsp;Consigning me again to “durance vile;”  
Five months the sweets of freedom to deplore,  
&emsp;Five months! till friends again around me smile!  
  
What melancholy thoughts in order rise!  
&emsp;When I reflect, a willing pris’ner here;  
My darling mistress, seeking purer skies,  
&emsp;Soars with the Muses to the solar sphere,  
  
And thither in her careful hand she bears,  
&emsp;The varied tribute of each anxious bard;  
Who each in turn, sweet hope, dark terror shares;  
&emsp;Dreads a reproof, and hopes a kind reward:
