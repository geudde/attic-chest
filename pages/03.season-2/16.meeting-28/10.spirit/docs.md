With deep Regret I view the Season o’er  
&emsp;Consigning me again to “Durance Vile;”  
Five months the Sweets of Freedom to deplore,  
&emsp;Five months! till Friends again around me smile!

My Darling Mistress, seeking purer Skies,  
&emsp;Soars with the Muses to the Solar Sphere,  
  
And thither in her careful Hand she bears,  
&emsp;The varied Tribute of each anxious Bard;  
Who each in Turn, sweet Hope, dark Terror shares;  
&emsp;Dreads a Reproof, and hopes a kind Reward:
