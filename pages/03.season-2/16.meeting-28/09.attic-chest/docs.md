Again my friends with sorrowing heart  
I see you from your Chest depart  
With tears lament my hapless doom  
For months to rest in cheerless gloom  
Yet as a favoured bard declares  
Hope brightest dawns through streaming tears  
E’en now the cheering ray I see  
Which shines refulgent, shines on me  
It tells me yonder glorious sun  
Who now his radiant course has run  
And bathes his tresses in the main  
Will soon resplendant rise again  
Says when a polar night is o’er  
That I like him shall rise once more  
Once more behold around me close  
A circle gay of belles and beaux  
While all with cheerful look appear  
And many a pleasing poem bear  
Whose sprightly wit, or sense sublime  
May scorn the ravages of time  
And to posterity proclaim  
Their tuneful genius, and my name  
But should this pleasing prospect fail  
Should “Hope but tell a flattering tale”  
And I no more around your Chest  
Impatience in your looks expressed  
Shall see you watch your Classic Box  
Till Ellen’s hand my store unlocks  
Still I may hope in grief or glee  
Your thoughts may sometimes turn to me  
While memory give to every jest  
A sprightlier turn a keener zest  
And as your kindling fancy warms  
Arrays my form with lovelier charms
