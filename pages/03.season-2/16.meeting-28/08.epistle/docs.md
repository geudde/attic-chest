<span class="title">Written on the 4th of June 1810  </span>
  
&emsp;Forgive the limping lines I wrote  
In answer to your charming note  
(Where with appropriate beauties vie  
Both fluent prose and poetry)  
And let dear maid my hurried Muse  
The roughness of my verse excuse  
For stupid full, and prest for time  
The goddess scarce vouchsafed a rhyme  
And if at last I gained the prize  
Poor grammar was the sacrifice.  
  
&emsp;Indulgent then let fancy’s eye  
Sweet maid each absent grace supply  
As smooth my rugged numbers make  
As in a calm, lone Katrine’s lake  
Give to each stupid senseless line  
An energy to equal thine  
And make (indeed what can she not)  
My verses seem to rival Scott  
  
&emsp;And oh dear maid, may we to day  
Pursue that bard’s enchanting lay  
In scenes of death and danger view  
Th’ undaunted chieftain Roderick Dhu  
This time may no domestic claims  
Force thee to quit the bold Fitz James  
From Malcolm or from Douglas bear  
Or thee from either Ellen tear  
  
&emsp;And Mary may they Norman ne’er  
&emsp;See on your cheek “the starting tear  
&emsp;Speak woe he may not stop to cheer”  
  
Forced by the fiery cross, to leave   
His virgin bride alone to grieve  
No sorrows may my Mary know  
But those which from the story flow  
When mild compassion drops the tear  
O’er Blanche’s woes, or Duncan’s bier  
  
&emsp;May we admire, disguised unknown  
The valiant Lord of Scotland’s throne  
At last in him with wonder view  
The conqueror of stout Roderick Dhu  
The friend of Ellen, whom he rowed  
Erewhile to her obscure abode  
The stranger knight who gave the ring  
The pledge of favour from the king  
  
&emsp;Mayst thou with admiration know  
How Roderick entertained his foe  
In generous unsuspecting mood  
Gave him to share his couch, his food  
And led him safe “thro’ watch, and ward  
Beyond Clan Alpine’s outmost guard”  
Where by his Monarch’s happier steel  
The fierce high-minded warrior fell.  
  
&emsp;And mayst thou in his turn admire  
The lovely Ellen’s exil’d sire  
Who nobly scorn’d by civil strife  
To purchase liberty and life  
Nor wish though righteous was the cause  
His friends should violate the laws  
  
&emsp;At length behold o’er every head  
Her shade the peaceful Olive spread  
The Douglas safe from future harms  
And Malcolm blest in Ellen’s charms  
Thus on our sovereign’s natal day  
The hours shall swiftly pass away  
While great R.A.’s together dine  
And drink his health in floods of wine  
And lords and knights, and squires resort  
With swords and bags to George’s court  
And maids and matrons gaily drest  
In monstrous hoop and narrow vest  
Their head with pendant lappets graced  
With gorgeous stomachers their waist  
The ancient Gothic rich costume  
Of gala days in regal room  
While there in loyal pomp the throng  
Unheeding hear the laureats song  
Delighted we’ll remain at home  
Or seek my sister’s neighbouring dome  
And fancy from our lowly bower  
Shall waft our mind to Stirling’s tower  
For us shall deck the regal hall  
For us shall frame the midnight ball  
While we around in wonder gaze  
As Ellen threads the dance’s maze  
While all the brave, the good, the wise  
Of ancient days before us rise  
And eve like this, dear maid will seem  
A sweet enchanting fairy dream  
One that full oft with pleasure new  
Delighted memory shall review.
