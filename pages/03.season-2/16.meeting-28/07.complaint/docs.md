How fast the illusions of happiness fly  
&emsp;Like the bubbles that rise on the breast of the Lake  
Like the lightnings in summer that flash tho’ the sky —  
&emsp;How pleasing the dream, but how soon we awake.  
  
2  
  
Ah fondly we hoped when Grim Umber we viewed  
&emsp;That the gnome but appeared our endeavours to aid  
Ah little we thought that the veil he pursued  
&emsp;When obtained would secure him the charms of the maid.  
  
3  
  
Yet surely affection had blinded our eyes  
&emsp;Or a sylph in a gnome would have never put trust  
Since we know, thought to mortals the truth they disguise  
&emsp;That their race are all treacherous false and unjust.  
  
4  
  
Too late of our confidence now we repent  
&emsp;In vain we our loves, our misfortunes bewail [prevail]  
For too well we know a gnome ne’er can relent  
&emsp;And by theft we can never recover the veil  

5  
  
In an adamant casket the prize he conceals  
&emsp;While sleepless he watches his treasure with care  
And a magical mirror before him reveals  
&emsp;To his cavern should spirits to seize it repair  
  
6  
  
He has tortures for those that awaken his ire  
&emsp;All dreadful for mortals, but worst for the sprite  
Our thin, airy forms he distends with his fire  
&emsp;Or compresses with cold to the size of a mite.  
  
7  
  
We know that by poets, (and truly) ’tis said  
&emsp;That inconstant from fair one to fair one we range  
But who that had seen such a beautiful maid  
&emsp;Who would or who could ever wish for a change  
  
8  
  
She is fair as Aurora, her eyes are as bright  
&emsp;As the stars that in winter illumine the sky  
And oh when she dances her step is so light  
&emsp;No sylph o’er the ground can so gracefully fly  
  
9  
  
Though fair as the fairest, less lovely than wise  
&emsp;Her manners are polished, and polished her mind  
While mirth and good-humour still beam in her eyes  
&emsp;And archness and satyr, by mildness refined  
  
10  
  
Oh then how inconstant that Sylphid must be  
&emsp;More inconstant than poets have fabled the fair  
Who his heart form the chains of Maria would free  
&emsp;And to one far less worthy the tribute would bear  

11  
  
Ah would that we had less inquisitive been  
&emsp;Then our fondness had not plunged the damsel in grief  
Or her face by his aid if we never had seen  
&emsp;Our despair might have found in her absence relief  
  
12  
  
By why do we all this inactive lament  
&emsp;While the sword of stern far o’er the maiden impends  
Let us fly (or we soon our delay may repent)  
&emsp;And arrest the dread blow ere on her it descends  
  
13  
  
Grim Umber has threaten’d a twelvemonth gone o’er  
&emsp;That he the sad maid to his cavern will bear  
The sight of the sun to revisit no more  
&emsp;No more the delights of society share  
  
14  
  
But if on that day we prevent his return  
&emsp;The veil to Maria he renders again  
And however with rage and resentment he burn  
&emsp;To espouse her hereafter his arts will be vain  
  
15  
  
Oh then let us fly with all speed to prepare  
&emsp;Some plot that our wisdom may aid and approve  
To keep him that day from the regions of air  
&emsp;We are called to the task both by vengeance and love  
  
*exit omnes*
