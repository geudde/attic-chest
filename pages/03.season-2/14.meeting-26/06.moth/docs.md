Since Stella hides her from my sight  
No guides my wonted ev’ning flight  
I’ll seek some less resplendent light  
&emsp;To cheer my way.  

But where is that magnetic pow’r  
That lures me to my *Stella’s* bow’r  
And makes the sober twilight hour  
&emsp;Like brightest day?  

’Tis hers alone, the charm, the spell,  
That thus my thoughts, my steps impel  
Through woody brake, or flowing dell  
&emsp;With her to stay.

Oh then return, sweet evening hour  
That calls me to my Stella’s bow’r;  
My polar star, then *show* thy pow’r  
&emsp;And guide my way!

Friday Night, June 8th
