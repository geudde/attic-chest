How sweet the morning’s vernal flowers  
&emsp;How sweet at sultry noon the gale  
How sweet to trace in evening hours  
&emsp;That stream that winds thro’ Ebor’s vale.  
But sweeter far the grief I feel  
&emsp;When back those hours that swiftly flew  
Return and to my bosom steal  
&emsp;The joys that late I shared with you.

How oft that stream, ungrateful Maid,  
&emsp;Has check’d his course, your vows to hear,  
How oft the grove, the grot, the glade,  
&emsp;Have heard you swear those vows sincere.  
If in such groves and grots there dwell  
&emsp;Superior powers as bards have said,  
Then Ebor’s every nymph can tell  
&emsp;That you are false, and I’m betrayed.

And did I think that beauteous face,  
&emsp;And did I think that form so fine,  
Adorn’d with each bewitching grace,  
&emsp;Ah! did I fondly think them mine.  
And did I think those melting eyes,  
&emsp;Would beam with love for me alone,  
And did I think unfeign’d your sighs  
&emsp;I did, false maid — and I’m undone.

Fool not to know that woman’s love,  
&emsp;Is fickle as the changeful wind  
That sands and restless waters prove  
&emsp;More stable than a woman’s mind.  
Some gaudy Fop’s delusive song,  
&emsp;Has praised the <span data-tippy="charms I praised before" class="green">beauties I adore</span>,  
And yielding to his honied tongue,  
&emsp;You on Lothario think no more.
