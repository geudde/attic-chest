Tho’ lovely fair the summer sky,  
Tho’ sweet is summer’s smile,  
Nor sweet, nor fair, to Malcolm’s eye  
Who mourns in sad captivity,  
Far from the lonely Isle!

But if by dear “Loch Katrine’s” side  
And “Her I love” was near the while,  
How sweet to watch its silv’ry tide  
Or on its liquid bosom glide  
Towards the lonely Isle!  

Oh! then, the summer sky so blue  
And all the charms of summer’s smile  
I pleas’d could own, with transport view,  
For “Her I love” would own them too!  
Upon the lonely Isle!

Malcolm Graeme
