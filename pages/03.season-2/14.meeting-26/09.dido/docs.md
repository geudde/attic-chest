Not so inconstant do we find  
&emsp;The waters of the sea  
Not so inconstant is the wind  
Its course to no fixed rules confined  
&emsp;That rages o’er the lea  
As in the plighted vows of love  
Man’s faithless sex to women prove  
Then hapless Dido, weep the while  
For Ictinus is gone to the lonely Isle

The willow wreath, the mournful vest  
&emsp;Must now, alas, be mine  
And Oh that fate would calm to rest  
The love that burns within my breast  
&emsp;Or bid it glow in thine  
But fate nor bids me cease to mourn  
Nor does my cruel swain return  
Who faithless in another’s smile  
Forgets me in the lonely Isle

Dido
