Oft when fair Cynthia’s silver light  
Illumes the ebon face of night,  
Alone confessed to poets’ sight  
On Earth the nimble fairies dance,  
Now o’er the grass they sportive hop  
Now gambol on the mushroom’s top,  
&emsp;Or now in graceful groups advance.

By night they sport, th’approach of day,  
Bids all to Fairy Land away,  
For should in Phoebus’ golden ray  
A lingering sprite be seen to rove  
That sprite a tedious year must dwell  
A prisoner in a flowery cell  
&emsp;Or in a songster of the grove.  

At mortal or immortal hearts  
Alike Love points his golden darts  
Alike the flame his shaft imparts,  
&emsp;As many a far-famed bard has told.  
In Fairy Land there dwelt a pair  
Titania’s daughter, Rosa fair  
&emsp;And one Sir Philomel the bold.  

Once through the shadow of the night,  
The god observed them dancing light,  
Instant he chose two arrows bright  
&emsp;And fixed the points in either heart.  
Henceforth on flowery banks reclined  
While each to each revealed their mind  
&emsp;The lovers sat from all apart.  

Where Persia’s kings the sceptre sway  
“Where flowers a brighter hue display  
And deeper drink the golden day”  
&emsp;They with their noble sovereigns came  
An Amra blossom’s fragrant shade  
Concealed the lover and the maid  
&emsp;Who owned their mutual flame.  

In vain the birds their song begun  
To warn them of the rising sun  
They never thought that night was flown  
&emsp;But heedless talked and talked again.  
A fragrant rose, soon Rosa grew,  
Soon Philomel, a bulbul flew  
&emsp;Nor either could their shape regain.  

By day deep sighs alone expressed  
The anguish of his wounded breast,  
The orb that chased his bosom’s rest  
&emsp;Was ever present to his sight,  
When Eve began her dews to shower  
He perched beside his much loved flower  
&emsp;And hailed with songs th’approach of night.  

The pensive flower expressed alone  
Her woes in fragrance soothing tone  
No ear might ever her moan  
&emsp;Save him caused her bosom smart  
For twelve long months they strove in vain  
Their former station to regain  
And fruitless tried their every art.  

But when the spring o’er laughing mead  
Again her robe of verdure spread  
Their shape regained, they homeward fled  
&emsp;There now in bliss united dwell,  
But still the *rose* adorns our plains  
<span data-tippy="The" class="green">While</span> pensive *bulbul* still retains  
&emsp;The name of noble *Philomel*.
