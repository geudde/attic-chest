Damon to Delia, in a declining state of health, and upon a visit to her friends at a distance.

Haste, lazy time; come on, blest hour  
&emsp;That brings her to my arms  
And puts again in Damon’s power  
&emsp;His Delia’s long lost charms

Soft is her heart and mild her eye  
&emsp;And lovely all her frame  
With her no other nymph can vie  
&emsp;So sweet no other name  

Restore ye distant plains restore  
&emsp;The sunshine of my days  
Ah, let this tedious night no more  
&emsp;Bewail her absent rays 

With her fair Pleasure’s still more fair  
&emsp;Without her joy is not  
Her hand unfurls the brow of care  
&emsp;And trouble is forgot  

Come Delia, come no truer heart  
&emsp;Hath Nature link’d to thine  
Come in thy grief, let me have part  
&emsp;And take thy share of mine  

Ah, why should sickness fade that face  
&emsp;Why sorrow waste that form  
A flow’ret of so fair a race  
&emsp;Should feel no blasting storm  

Could rude Affliction see her worth  
&emsp;His eye would melt in tears  
No pain of her would e’er call forth  
&emsp;A child’s or husband’s tears  

O thou[^1] who with unfeeling heart  
&emsp;Chastisest human crimes  
Recall, recall that erring dart  
&emsp;And give her happier times  

Banish’d from me, from mine, from home  
&emsp;Where none like she can please  
Why should the guiltless wanderer roam  
&emsp;In quest of health and ease  

Her artless babes with eyes full fraught  
&emsp;Demand a mother’s care  
That she their welfare ceaseless sought  
&emsp;Why should it hers impair  

Why should her Damon’s heart be broke  
&emsp;His truth will never fail  
Ev’n when her virgin hand he took  
&emsp;He lov’d her not so well  

Ne’er with her will why by her ills  
Must she destroy his peace  
’Twill break her heart that thus she deals  
A wound she cannot ease  

If Damon’s help can give relief  
&emsp;Or aught his prayers obtain  
His Delia’s eye shall know no grief  
&emsp;His Delia’s heart no pain

But vigorous health and lively cheer  
&emsp;Shall animate her frame  
And she thro’ many a blissful year  
&emsp;Shall find his love the same  

Our babes shall live, and live to grow  
&emsp;Beneath our tending care  
So all we wish to be and know  
&emsp;To all that’s good and fair  

Their virtue form’d this labour o’er  
&emsp;And for a while enjoy’d  
When life’s best scenes can please no more  
&emsp;We’ll yield to time’s strong tide  

At every ebb more close we’ll grasp  
&emsp;In friendship’s firm embrace  
’Till in one moment one last gasp  
&emsp;Shall both our souls displace  

Death shan’t divide whom love combin’d  
&emsp;And melted into one  
Heav’n were not Heav’n to either mind  
&emsp;Where either were alone  

No, my Best Life, the same sweet bowers  
&emsp;Shall shade us both above  
And there with all that we’ve call’d ours  
&emsp;We’ll ever live and love
