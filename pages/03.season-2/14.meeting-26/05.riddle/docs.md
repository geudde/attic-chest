<div class="author">Miss Flaxman</div>

’Tis sweet, tho better, ’tis both joy and grief  
’Tis subtle poison, yet it gives relief  
A special pleader who with most prevails  
And tho’ a bosom friend, it oft tells tales  
A messenger unmarked by any eye  
That moves unseen, and yet is not a spy  
’Tis often false, but of’tner still ’tis true  
And mine dear girl I dedicate to you

Amintor
