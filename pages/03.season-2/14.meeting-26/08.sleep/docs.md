Come oh sleep with swiftest wing  
Here thy potent poppies bring  
Dipped in Lethe’s silent spring  
And upon my temples fling

In this bower which I have chose  
Here forgetful of my woes  
Free from danger, free from foes  
Let me for a time repose

Let me in some pleasing dream  
Sporting with the fairies seem  
Where fall Cynthia’s silent beam  
Or the verdant grass doth stream  

Or let around my nodding head  
Fair seraphic forms be spread  
While the hours with arrowy tread  
Round the earth incessant speed  

Or in sweet Elysian bowers  
On a bed of deathless flowers  
Nourished by ambrosial showers  
Pass away the happy hours  

Come then O Sleep with swiftest wing  
Here thy potent poppies bring  
Dipped in Lethe’s silent spring  
And upon my temples fling

Narcotus
