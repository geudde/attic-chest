Sweet girl, may no terror thy bosom annoy  
&emsp;O’er thee may no clouds of adversity burst  
The roses which bloom on thy cheeks to destroy  
&emsp;And give them so mournful a hue as my *first*.  
  
Still foremost be thou in simplicity’s train,  
&emsp;Still virtuous, gentle, and modest be thou  
Nor join with the haughty, the giddy, the vain  
&emsp;At the strike of my *second* who fidelity bow  
  
For ah! should their folly thy fancy allure  
&emsp;The example might make thee from rectitude swerve,  
Might sully that bosom which now is so pure  
&emsp;And my *third* be a title e’en thou may’st deserve.  
  
Then care and repentance shall wither thy bloom  
&emsp;Thy charms and they graces will speedily fly  
Thy cheeks the sad hue of my *first* will assume  
&emsp;And art must the roses of nature supply.
