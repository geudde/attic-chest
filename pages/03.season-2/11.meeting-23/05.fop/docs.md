At Bletchington there lived a wight  
&emsp;Surnamed the Man of Path  
As thin as famed La Mancha’s knight  
&emsp;As tall as him of Gath  
’Tis said the thing was six feet, ten  
&emsp;In height from top to toe  
And it was of the class of men  
&emsp;By others called a *beau*  
It had (’tis said) a tongue to talk  
&emsp;A mouth with which to grin  
On two hind paws it used to walk  
&emsp;With legs so long and thin  
The gods had given two paws more  
&emsp;With which (tho’ strange ’tis true)  
Since beaux have ceased to walk on *four*  
&emsp;It knew not what to do  
So one hung dangling at his side  
&emsp;Bedecked with whip or cane  
And t’other always was employ’d  
&emsp;In twirling its watch chain  
Whene’er the female train appeared  
&emsp;The creature was on duty  
And whispered soft things in their ears  
&emsp;About true Love and Beauty  
Each word as soft as *Butter* flows  
&emsp;And sweet as honey too  
And quite as harmless heaven well knows  
&emsp;As three times skimm’d sky blue  
To all alike it told its tales  
&emsp;And followed Stanhope’s rules  
Who bids us when our small talk fails  
&emsp;To sit and grin (like fools)  
It various Novels reads full oft  
&emsp;And many a tuneful lay  
From silence it steals its speeches soft  
&emsp;And compliments so gay  
And when it wishes most to shine  
&emsp;’Twill sit at home and write  
A thousand speeches superfine  
&emsp;To spark away at Night  
Once at a rout it chanced to take  
&emsp;Its speeches from its Poke  
And found a Set Oh! dire mistake  
&emsp;Which it before had spoke  
The dire mistake the Ladies rue  
&emsp;For not one tale it told  
It could not think of one thing new  
&emsp;And *these* were all too old  
And so alas poor luckless wight  
&emsp;Alack and well aday  
It sat in silence all the night  
&emsp;And grinn’d the hours away.
