At Bletchington there lived a wight  
&emsp;Surnamed the Man of Path  
As thin as famed La Mancha’s knight  
&emsp;As tall as him of Gath  
’Tis said the thing was six feet, ten  
&emsp;In height from top to toe  
And it was of the class of men  
&emsp;By others called a *beau*  
It had (’tis said) a tongue to talk  
&emsp;A mouth with which to grin  
On two hind paws it used to walk  
&emsp;With legs so long and thin  
The gods had given two paws more  
&emsp;With which (tho’ strange ’tis true)  
Since beaux have ceased to walk on *four*  
&emsp;It knew not what to do  
So one hung dangling at his side  
&emsp;Bedecked with whip or cane  
And t’other always was employ’d  
&emsp;In twirling its watch chain  
Whene’er the female train appeared  
&emsp;The creature was on duty
