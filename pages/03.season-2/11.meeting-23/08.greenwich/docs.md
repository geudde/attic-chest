<span class="title">First of May</span>
  
<span class="title">1</span>
  
Though clouds obscured the morning hour  
&emsp;And keen and eager blew the blast  
And drizzling fell the cheerless shower  
&emsp;As doubtful to the skiff we passed.  
  
<span class="title">2</span>
  
All soon propitious to our prayer  
&emsp;Gave promise of a brighter day  
The clouds dispers’d in <span data-tippy="brighter" class="green">purer</span> air  
&emsp;The blast in zephyrs died away  
  
<span class="title">3</span>
  
So have we, Love, a day enjoy’d  
&emsp;On which we both — and yet who knows  
May dwell with pleasure unalloy’d  
&emsp;And dread no thorn beneath the rose  
  
<span class="title">4</span>
  
How pleasant, from that dome crown’d hill  
&emsp;To view the varied scene below  
Woods, ships, and spires, and lovelier still  
&emsp;The circling Thames’ majestic flow  
  
<span class="title">5</span>
  
How sweet as indolently laid  
&emsp;We overhang that long drawn dale  
To watch the chequer’d light and shade  
&emsp;That glanc’d upon the shifting sail  
  
<span class="title">6</span>
  
And when the shadow’s rapid growth  
&emsp;Proclaim’d the noon tide hour expir’d  
And though unwearied, nothing loath  
&emsp;We to our simple meal retired  
  
<span class="title">7</span>
  
The sportive wile, the blameless jest  
&emsp;The careless mind’s spontaneous flow  
Gave to that simple meal a zest  
&emsp;Which richer tables may not know  
  
<span class="title">8</span>
  
The babe that on its mother’s breast  
&emsp;Has toy’d and wanton’d for a while  
And sinking to unconscious rest  
&emsp;Looks up to catch a parting smile  
  
<span class="title">9</span>
  
Feels less assured than thou dear maid  
&emsp;Where ere thy ruby lips could part  
(It’s close to mine thy cheek was laid,)  
&emsp;Thine eyes had open’d all thy heart  
  
<span class="title">10</span>
  
Then, thou, I mark’d the chasten’d joy  
&emsp;That lightly o’er thy features stole  
From vows repaid (my sweet employ)  
&emsp;From truth from innocence of soul  
  
<span class="title">11</span>
  
While every word dropped on my ear  
&emsp;So soft (and yet it seems to thrill)  
So sweet, that ’twas a heaven to hear  
&emsp;And e’en thy pause had musick still  
  
<span class="title">12</span>
  
And O, how like a fairy dream  
&emsp;To gaze in silence on the tide  
While soft and warm the sunny gleam  
&emsp;Slept on the glassy surface wide  
  
<span class="title">13</span>
  
And many a thought of fancy bred  
&emsp;Wild, soothing, tender, undefin’d  
Play’d lightly round the heart and shed  
&emsp;Delicious languour o’er the mind  

<span class="title">14</span>

So hours like moments wing’d their flight  
&emsp;Till now the Boatman on the shore  
Impatient of the evening light  
&emsp;Recall’d us by the darking oar  

<span class="title">15</span>

Well Anna many days like this  
&emsp;I cannot, must not, hope to share  
For I have found an hour of bliss  
&emsp;Still follow’d by an age of care  

<span class="title">16</span>

Yet oft when memory intervenes  
&emsp;But you dear maid be happy still  
Nor e’er regret mid fairer scenes  
&emsp;The day we passed on Greenwich Hill
