Sir Knight are we so perfect grown  
That you no speck descry —  
Or is it, that you fear to own,  
That you our faults can spy —  
You, who could brave a dragon’s claw  
Tho’ breathing fiery vapour  
Or take a lion by the paw  
Flea giants with your rapier!  
’Tis *you* good Sir who seem to fear  
A Tartar to be catching  
And think that when three females meet  
Some mischief must be hatching!  
&emsp;A task less arduous than before  
Bespeaks your kind attention  
Our *virtues* Sir, a scanty store  
Will call up your *invention*  
But if in *truth* you should persist  
The lines will not be many  
For count them *all*, I think the list  
Won’t fill a silver penny!
