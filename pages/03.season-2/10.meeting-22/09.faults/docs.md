Innumerous are the grains of sand  
That shine on ocean’s barren strand  
Innumerous are the drops of rain  
Which April showers upon the plain  
Innumerous are the flowers that spread  
When spring commands th’ enamelled mead  
But more innumerous still we find  
The faults that lurk in woman kind.  
  
Inconstant is the changing moon  
Now waxing fast, but waning soon  
Inconstant is the wind that blows  
From every aire nor knows repose  
Th’inconstant waves each moment change  
Their forms as o’er the shores they range  
But more inconstant still we find  
The wav’ring race of woman kind.  
  
Of nature’s sevenfold colours vain  
The gaudy peacock struts the plain  
Vain of his form his strength his speed  
Pawing the ground we view the steed  
Vain of its whiteness — ere it stain  
Its fur, the ermine will be slain  
But of their charms more vain we find  
Than these the race of woman kind.  
  
The wily lapwing will delude  
With lameness feign’d to save her brood  
The serpent is renown’d for wiles  
And poison lurks beneath his smiles  
Too weak by force to seize his prey  
Sly Reynard flatters to betray  
But more insidious still we find  
The wily race of woman kind.  
  
With headlong rage and ceaseless force  
The impetuous torrent holds its course  
Nor trees nor rocks obstructs its way  
It tears them from their beds away  
Holds unrestrained its dreadful reign  
And thunders o’er the wasted plain  
Alas more loud, more strong we find  
Th’unceasing tongues of woman kind.  
  
Envious of others brighter charms  
Th’midnight bat presages harms  
And envious of our present good  
The raven as he roams for food  
Or watches in his lonely home  
Gives omens dire of ills to come  
But still more envious do we find  
The dangerous race of woman kind.  
  
But endless were the task to sing  
The faults in woman kind that spring  
E’en now their slanderous tongues I fear  
And must their cruelty beware  
The bard who dares their rage await  
May chance to meet with Orpheus’ fate  
For than Charybdis still we find  
More fell the race of woman kind.  
  
Yet sure Thalestris’ warlike arm  
Would well defend the bard from harm  
Who all the sex’s vengeance dar’d  
To gain her favour’s blest reward  
Nay her perfections might reverse  
This way the burthen of my verse  
More numerous than their faults we find  
The virtues of the female kind.  
  
For sure Thalestris merits high  
Should save her sex from obloquy  
Since in herself we view combin’d  
Perfections of each varying kind  
Each science and each art that decks  
The colder and the softer sex  
But ah, too seldom do we find  
Like her the race of woman kind.
