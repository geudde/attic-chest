> An Anti-Thalestris
  
From nature horns the bulls derive  
&emsp;The horse his feet which never tire  
She to the hare did swiftness give  
&emsp;To lions, their courageous fire  
  
Their wings for flight to birds she gave  
To fish their fins which cut the wave  
Their prudence last bestowed on men  
For woman left what present then?  
Beauty â€” more sure than spear or shield  
Which they (resistless armour) wield  
It triumphs over fire and steel  
And nothing can resist a belle.
