<span class="title">To Thalestris</span>

What though the noble lord of this fair hall  
Declines the combat as an idle brawl!  
Of female tongues and pens alike afraid  
He slights the challenge of the martial maid!  
Shall lady’s gauntlet then unheeded lie  
Shall gallant knight from gentle lady fly?  
No, by St. George! I here throw down my gage  
And with *Thalestris self* the war I’ll wage!  
That ladies *have* their *faults* must be allow’d,  
Which sometimes peep from ’midst the brilliant crowd —  
Of them fair *Virtues*, and each small defect  
Adds brightness to the whole, and give effect!  
*I know ye all my lovely dames,* so well,  
That every trivial blemish I could tell!  
But the most prominent I needs must say  
Is woman’s love of *universal sway!!*  
If I might *venture* to approach so near  
To whisper *softly* in the fair-one’s ear,  
This, I would tell him, and her *known* good sense  
Would soon convince her I meant no *offence*  
That while the Laurel shades the Hero’s brow  
Won by his prowess in the warlike field,  
Far sweeter triumphs doth the female know  
Who *conquers most*, when most, she *seems to yield!*
