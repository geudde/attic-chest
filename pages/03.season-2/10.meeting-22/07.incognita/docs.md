A Woman’s Faults! A pretty theme  
Dear Miss — Upon my word you dream  
I have my full share of toils and moans,  
And mean if possible to keep whole bones —  
Let me flea Giants, if I can;  
Let me spit Dragons like a man;  
Let me encounter Hosts of men,  
And like bold Falstaff slay twice ten;  
Or fairly risk the loss of limb;  
Or face the King of Terrors grim;  
Or any Feat in your defence,  
Within the bounds of common sense;  
But — to attack ye — Spare my Shame,  
My hard earn’d Honour, Courage, Fame;  
<span data-tippy="Rais’d" class="green">Willfull</span> like some Castle in the air,  
When I lie slain with Bodkin bare.  
&emsp;Yet somehow I suspect ’tis prattle  
When you propose this hum’rous battle,  
And that to catch & roast a Tartar,  
Is all your subtle Wish is after.
