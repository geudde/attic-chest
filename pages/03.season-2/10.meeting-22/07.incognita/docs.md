<div class="author">Communicated by Miss Flaxman</div>

A woman’s faults! A pretty theme  
Dear miss — Upon my word you dream  
I have my full share of toils and moans,  
And mean if possible to keep whole bones —  
Let me flea giants, if I can;  
Let me spit dragons like a man;  
Let me encounter hosts of men,  
And like bold Falstaff slay twice ten;  
Or fairly risk the loss of limb;  
Or face the King of Terrors grim;  
Or any feat in your defence,  
Within the bounds of common sense;  
But — to attack ye — Spare my shame,  
My hard earn’d honour, courage, fame;  
<span data-tippy="Rais’d" class="green">Willfull</span> like some castle in the air,  
When I lie slain with bodkin bare.  
&emsp;Yet somehow I suspect ’tis prattle  
When you propose this hum’rous battle,  
And that to catch & roast a Tartar,  
Is all your subtle wish is after.
