### Woman   
  
> A Satyr from the Greek  
> by  
> We know not who  
  
What antient times these times we fancy wise  
Have told of Woman’s faults and whence they rise  
What morals teach it and what fables hid  
What author wrote it, how that author died  
All these I sing — In Greece they fram’d the tale  
In Greece a Poet was allowed to rail  
Buthad he liv’d in George’s golden days  
The charms of woman had engross’d his lays  
Oh had he heard the notes by Laura sung  
The lively sense that flows from Myra’s tongue  
Or Delia’s lambent Wit and humour sly  
Or seen the loves that sport in Denman’s eye  
Or felt the gentle charms of Celia’s face  
Or in the dance Matilda’s matchless grace  
Or the sweet Magic of Miranda’s strain  
The chords of Satyr he had touch’d in vain  
The strings in censure had refus’d to move  
Or like Anacreon’s echo’d praise and love  
Then Maids and Matrons where the poet drew  
With softest Pencil think he dreamt of you  
And warn’d by him ye wanton pens beware  
How Heaven’s concern’d to vindicate the fair  
The case was Hesiod’s he the fable writ  
Some think we meaning some with idle wit  
’Tis both or either — as he Ladies please  
I wave the contest and commence the lays.  
  
In days of yore (no matter where or when  
’Twas ere the low creation swarm’d with men)  
That one Prometheus, sprung of heavenly birth  
(Our author’s song can witness) liv’d on earth  
He carv’d the turf to mould a manly frame  
And stole from Jove his animating flame  
The sly contrivance o’er Olympics ran  
When thus the monarch of the stars began  
&emsp;Oh vers’d in arts! whose daring thoughts aspire  
To kindle clay with never-dying fire!  
Enjoy thy glory past, that gift was thine;  
The next thy creature meets be fairly mine:  
And such a gift, a vengeance so design’d  
As suits the counsel of a God to find  
A pleasing bosom cheat; a specious ill  
Which felt th[e]y curse, yet covet still to feel  
&emsp;He said and Vulcan strait the Sire commands  
To temper mortals with ethereal hands  
In such a shape to mold a rising Fair  
As virgin goddesses are proud to wear  
To make her eyes with diamond water shine  
And form her organs for a voice divine  
’Twas thus the Sire ordained; the Pow’r obey’d  
And work’d and wondered at the work he made  
The fairest, softest, sweetest frame beneath  
Now made to seem; now more than seem to breathe  
&emsp;A Vulcan ends, the cheerful Queen of charms  
Clasp’d the new panting creature in her arms  
From that embrace a fine complexion spread  
Where mingled whiteness glow’d with softer red  
Then in a Kiss she breath’d her various arts  
Of trifling prettily with wounded hearts  
A mind for love, but still a changing mind  
The lisp affected and the glance design’d  
The sweet confusing blush, the secret wink  
The gentle swimming walk, the courteous sink  
The stare for strangeness, fit for scorn the frown  
For decent yielding looks declining down  
Gay smiles to comfort, April showers to move  
And all the nature all the art of love  
  
Gold-scepter’d Juno next exalts the fair;  
Her touch endows her with imperious air,  
Self-valuing fancy, highly-crested pride,  
Strong sov’reign will, and some desire to chide;  
For which, an eloquence, that aims to vex,  
With native tropes of anger, arms the sex.  
&emsp;Minerva, skilful Goddess, train’d the mind  
To twirl the spindle by the twisting thread  
To fix the loom, instruct the reeds to part  
Cross the long weft and close the web with art,  
An useful gift, but what profuse expence  
What world of fashions, took its rise from hence  
&emsp;Young Hermes next, a close contriving God  
Her brows encircled with his serpent rod  
Then plots and fair excuses fill’d her brain  
The views of breaking am’rous vows for gain;  
The price of favours; the designing arts  
That aim at riches in contempt of hearts  
And for a comfort in the marriage life  
The little pilf’ring temper of a wife  
Full on the Fair his beams Apollo flung  
And fond persuasion tip’d her easy tongue  
He gave her words, where oily flatt’ry lays  
The pleasing colours of the art of praise  
And wit, to scandal exquisitely prone,  
Which frets, another’s spleen to cure its own  
Those sacred Virgins whom the Bards revere  
Tun’d all her voice, and shed a sweetness there  
To make her sense with double charms abound  
Or make her lively nonsense please by sound  
&emsp;To dress the maid, the decent Graces brought  
A robe in all the dyes of beauty wrought  
And placed their boxes o’er a rich brocade  
Where pictur’d Loves on every cover play’d  
Then spread those implements that Vulcan’s art  
Had fram’d to merit Cytherea’s heart  
The wire to curl, the close indented comb  
To call the locks, that lightly wander, home;  
And chief, the mirror, where the ravished maid  
Beholds and loves her own reflected shade  
&emsp;Fair Flora lent her stores; the purpled hours  
Confin’d her tresses with a wreath of flowers  
Within the wreath arose a radiant crown,  
A veil pellucid hung depending down  
Back roll’d her azure veil with serpent fold  
The purfled border deck’d the floor with Gold  
Her robe (which closely by the girdle brac’d  
Reveal’d the beauties of a slender waist)  
Flow’d to the feet, to copy Venus’ air,  
When Venus’ statues have a robe to wear.  
&emsp;The new-sprung creature finish’d thus for harms  
Adjusts her habit, practises her charms  
With blushes glows, or shines with lively smiles  
Confirms her will, or recollects her wiles  
Then conscious of her worth, with easy pace  
Glides by the glass, and turning views her face  
&emsp;A finer flax, then what they wrought before  
Thro’ time’s deep cave, the Sister Fates explore  
They fix the loom, their fingers nimbly weave  
And thus their toil prophetic songs deceive.  
&emsp;Flow from the rock, my flax! and swiftly flow  
Pursue thy thread the spindle runs below  
A creature fond and changing fair and vain,  
The creature woman, rises now to reign.  
New beauty blooms, a beauty form’d to fly  
New love begins, a love produc’d to die  
New parts distress the troubled scenes of life,  
The fondling mistress, and the ruling wife  
&emsp;Men born to labour, all with pains provide  
Women have time for vanity and pride:  
They want the care of man their want they know  
And dress to please with heart alluring show  
The show prevailing, for the sway contend  
And make a servant where they meet a friend  
&emsp;Thus in a thousand wax-erected forts  
A loitering race the painful bee supports  
From sun to sun, from bank to bank he flies  
With honey loads his bags, with wax his thighs  
Fly where he will, at home the race remain  
Prune the silk dress, and murmuring eat the grain  
&emsp;Yet here and there we grant a gentle bride  
Whose temper betters by a father’s side  
Unlike the rest that double human care  
Fond to relieve and resolute to share  
Happy the man whom thus his stars advance  
The curse is general but the blessing chance  
&emsp;Thus sung the Sisters, while the Gods admire  
Their beauteous creature, made for man in ire  
The young Pandora she whom all contend  
To make too perfect not to gain her end  
Then bid the winds that fly to breathe the spring  
Return to bear her on a gentle wing  
With wafting airs the winds obsequious blow  
And land the shining vengeance safe below  
A golden coffer in her hand she bore  
The present treach’rous but the bearer more  
’Twas fraught with pangs; for Jove ordain’d above  
That gold should aid and pangs attend on love  
&emsp;Her gay descent the man perceiv’d afar  
Wond’ring he run to catch the falling star  
But so surpris’d that none but he can tell  
Who lov’d so quickly and who lov’d so well  
Thro’ all his veins the wand’ring passion burns  
He calls her Nymph and ev’ry Nymph by turns  
Her form to lovely Venus he prefers  
Or swears that Venus must be such as hers  
She proud to rule yet strangely fram’d to tease  
Neglects his offers while her airs she plays  
Shoots scornful glances from the bended frown  
In brisk disorder trips it up and down  
Then hums a careless tune to lay the storm  
And sits, and blushes, smiles, and yields in form  
&emsp;Now take what Jove design’d, she softly cried  
This box thy portion and myself they bride  
Fir’d with the prospect of the double charms  
He snatch’d the box, and bride, with eager arms  
  
Unhappy man! to whom so bright she shone  
The fatal gift, her tempting self, unknown  
The winds were silent, all the waves asleep  
And heav’n was trac’d upon the flatt’ring deep  
But whilst he looks unmindful of a storm  
And thinks the water wears a stable form  
What dreadful din around his ears shall rise!  
What frowns confuse his picture of the skies!  
&emsp;At first the creature man was fram’d alone  
Lord of himself and all the world his own  
For him the Nymphs in green forsook the woods  
For him the Nymphs in blue forsook the floods,  
In vain the Satyr’s rage, the Tritons rave  
They bore him heroes in the secret cave  
No care destroy’d no sick disorder prey’d  
No bending age his sprightly form decay’d  
No wars were known, no females heard to rage  
And Poets tell us — ’twas a golden age  
&emsp;When Woman came those ills the box confin’d  
Burst furious out, and poison’d all the wind  
From point to point, from pole to pole they flew  
Spread as they went and in their progress grew  
  
The Nymphs regretting left the mortal race  
And alt’ring nature wore a sickly face  
New terms of folly rose, new states of care  
New plagues, to suffer and to please the Fair!  
The mean designs of well-dissembled love  
The sordid matches never join’d above  
Abroad the labour, and at home the noise  
(Man’s double suff’rings for domestic joys)  
The rival’s sword; the qualm that takes the fair  
Disdain for passion, passion in despair —  
These and a thousand, yet unname’d we find;  
Ah fear the thousand, yet unname’d behind!  
&emsp;Thus on Parnassus tuneful Hesiod sung  
The mountain echo’d and the valley rung  
The sacred groves a fix’d attention show  
The crystal Helicon forbore to flow   
The sky grew bright, and (if his verse be true)  
The Muses came to give the Laurel too  
But what avail’d the verdant prize of wit  
If love swore vengeance for the tales he writ  
Ye, Fair offended hear your friend relate  
What heavy judgment prov’d the writer’s fate  
Tho’ when it happen’d, no relation clears  
’Tis thought in five, or five and twenty years  
&emsp;Where dark and silent, with a twisted shade  
The neighbouring woods a native arbour made  
There oft a tender pair as poets say  
Retiring, toy’d the ravish’d hours away  
A Locrian youth, the gentle Troilus he  
A fair Milesian, kind Evanthe she  
But some hoar Virgin in an envious hour  
Betray’d the secrets of the conscious bow’r  
The dire disgrace her brothers count their own  
And track her steps, to make its author known.  
&emsp;It chanc’d one evening, ’twas the lover’s day  
Conceal’d in brakes the jealous kindred lay  
When Hesiod wand’ring, mus’d along the plain  
And fix’d his seat where love had fix’d the scene  
A strong suspicion strait profess’d their mind  
(For poets ever were a gentle kind)  
But when Evanthe near the passage stood  
Flung back a doubtful look, and shot the wood  
“Now take (at once they cry) thy due reward”  
And urg’d with erring rage, assault the Bard  
His corpse the sea receiv’d. The dolphins bore  
(’Twas all the Gods would do) the corpse to shore  
Methinks I view the dead with pitying eyes  
And see the dreams of ancient wisdom rise  
I see the Muses round the body cry,  
But hear a Cupid loudly laughing by;  
He wields his arrow with insulting hand,  
And thus inscribes the moral on the sand.  
“Here Hesiod lies, ye future Bards beware  
How far your moral tales incense the Fair  
Unlov’d, unloving, ’twas his fate to bleed  
Without his quiver Cupid caus’d the deed  
He judg’d this turn of malice justly due  
And Hesiod died for joys he never knew.”
