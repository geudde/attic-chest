It was a spark of brilliant Wit  
My heart inflammable did Flit  
It fired my fancy, turned my brain  
I ne’er shall be myself again.  
Hobgoblins fly about my bed  
And Imps and Fairies fill my head  
Sometimes I wake in frights and fears  
Sweet Music’s sounding in my ears  
And think I see the forms divine  
Of Hesiod and The Tuneful Nine  
Then doze again, I in my dream  
Fair Tinderella’s self I seem  
And vainly strive to strike a light  
No sparkling Meteor cheers my sight  
I only strike my tender knuckles  
Rosa stands by and slyly chuckles  
Why did I listen to that Ode  
Admired more than understood  
While some it only sore amazed  
My feeble wits it quite hath crazed.
