The charms which blooming beauty shews  
From faces heavenly fair,  
We to the lily and the rose  
With semblance apt compare.  
  
With semblance apt; for ah! how soon  
How soon they all decay,  
The lily droops, the rose is gone  
And beauty fades away —  
  
But when bright virtue sins confest  
With sweet discretion join’d;  
When mildness calms the peaceful breast  
And wisdom guides the mind  
  
When charms, like these, dear maid, conspire  
Thy person to approve,  
They kindle generous chaste desire  
And everlasting love.  
  
Beyond the reach of time or fate  
There graces shall endure  
Still like the passion they create  
Eternal. Constant. Pure.
