The wanton boy who pierces hearts  
Had long been absent on his duty  
But wanting arrows home he flies  
To greet mama, the queen of beauty  
My son she cried and sweetly smil’d  
My darling mischief loving child  
Hast thou with thy keenest dart  
Struck Ictinus stubborn heart?  
Indeed mama it would be glorious  
O’er such a heart to be victorious  
’Tis form’d of such obdurable stuff!  
Sure never was a heart so tough!  
It blunts the points of all my arrows  
And down they drop like shotten sparrows.  
That heart of his is cas’d so well  
Or like Sir More who kill’d the dragon  
Is he I’ve made this hot attack on  
Or like fair Thetis’ valiant son  
In Styx <span data-tippy="hath" class="green">he has</span> had a dipping  
Or else as sure as any gun  
I must have caught him tripping  
By daddy Jove I’ll make him feel  
I’ll find a keener dart  
And not like Paris hit the heel  
But strike a nobler part.

Dido
