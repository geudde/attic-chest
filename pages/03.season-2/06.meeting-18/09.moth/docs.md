Gentle Stella sweetly shine  
With mild refulgent ray  
On your benighted Valentine  
For he has lost his way!  

For ever I would circling play  
Around my Stella’s head  
Nor wish to meet a brighter day  
Than from her eye is shed!  
  
But ah! incautious vent’rous thing  
Ah silly! silly fly!  
For ever now, you scorch your wing  
Go nearer, and you die!  
  
Moth
