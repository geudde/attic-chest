Seducing Wit, thou soul-enlivening ray,  
Deceptive fire, that shines but to betray;  
Meteor, whose blaze infatuates the sight  
With brilliant but unprofitable light.  
Thou rare, but fatal Gift! invidious art,  
The subtle poison that corrupts the heart;  
Perfidious inmate even to the breast,  
Where thou’rt most fondly cherish’d and caress’d:  
In thee what various qualities combine,  
And who thy protean nature can define?  
Condemn’d tho’ courted — hated tho’ admir’d;  
Dreaded in others, by ourselves desir’d;  
Shunned by the dull, by wisdom disapprov’d,  
By most applauded, but by few belov’d.  
’Tis thine to aim the sharp envenom’d dart,  
With skill unerring, at a kindred heart,  
To raise, unmindful of discretion’s laws,  
An host of foes, to gain — one fool’s applause.  
Thine the keen sarcasm and the quick retort,  
The playful malice — that can wound in sport.  
Aw’d by the piercing glances of thine eyes,  
Offsighted Love expands his wings and flies;  
And as a flower that shrinks beneath the blight,  
Insulted friendship sickens at the sight;  
Yet when with all the gay and sportive grace  
Thou com’st to light up joy in every face,  
And bring’st frank pleasantry and fancy wild,  
With humour quaint, thy mirth-inspiring child;  
When calm forbearance cheeks they rapid tide.  
And judgment deigns thy erring steps to guide;  
While mild good-humour tempers every dart,  
And bids thee throw they scorpion task apart.  
Who but must yield to thy bewitching power,  
And rather brave the thorn — than lose the flower,  
Resentment soften’d by thy smile disarms,  
And e’en relenting wisdom owns they charms.  
Oh winning mischief, fertile source of ill,  
While I condemn thee — I must love thee still  
By reason prompt’d I would break they chain,  
But one bright look would lure me back again.
