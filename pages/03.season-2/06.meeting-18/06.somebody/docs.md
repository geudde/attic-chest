Good people I have lost my heart,  
And somebody has ta’en it,  
But here the truth I must confess;  
He took no pains to gain it!  
  
Perverse, and Woman-like, I own  
This truth I will not mask it,  
I gave him what he comes not for,  
Because, he did not ask it!  
  
And while it beats against his breast  
Like fresh caught Bird in cage;  
He knows not whose the flatterer is,  
I’d venture any wage!  
  
Perhaps, he takes it for his own,  
That causes such commotion,  
And wonders much, what can have caus’d  
In him, the strange emotion!  
  
And never, never may he guess  
The heart that once was mine;  
While I in silence live and die  
His unknown Valentine!  
  
For Somebody
