Faults nod at faults, each fable has its brother  
And beaux and belles are mirrors to each other  
  
Yet stay, my Muse, & guide the timid pen  
To state (O fearful task!) the faults of men!  
’Tis surely stepping upon unsafe ground —  
Or rather, vent’ring on the seas profound  
In a frail bark, no skilful hand to steer  
No chart to guide us the dread rocks to clear,  
Ah! if man’s adamantine pride we shun  
And midst the whirlpool of his passion run  
Or on the quicksands of his flatt’ry tost  
Our little bark must sink, it must be lost!  
But if rude dangers such as these we pass  
And the smooth water seems like liquid glass  
In the dead calm of his indiff’rence wait  
’Till the next hurricane decides our fate!  
Oh then if jealousy’s dire winds arise  
Before its breath all hopes of safety flies  
Whirlwinds of rage, not reason’s power can check  
Tear the weak bark, & and drive the hapless wreck  
But leave we now the terrors of the main  
And gladly tow’rds our home turn once again  
For there no rage, nor cruelty we find  
The nobler sex are there, both just, & kind  
Whene’er Honorius wills we pleased obey  
Grieve, if he’s griev’d, & smile if he is gay  
And who’ll refuse to join in Reinhold’s praise  
To wish him happiness & length of days  
To love his converse & his guileless mirth  
His spotless honour & his various worth  
In gentler Allen all his friends can find  
The unassuming graces of the mind  
In Philo, probity & penetration keen  
Unite in one — in one not frequent seen  
Our circle boasts the virtues most I prize  
If faults here are — on those I shut my eyes!
