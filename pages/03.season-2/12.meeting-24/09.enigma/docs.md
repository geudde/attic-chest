In Jerkin short, and nut brown Coat I live;  
Pleasure to all, and Pain to all I give:  
Quivers I have, and painted arrows too;  
Gold in my Dart, and Iron in my Shoe:  
I never eat, and yet I’m always full;  
Poisons from herbs, and Sweets from Flow’rs I cull;  
I never read, yet often times I write;  
I never go to War, yet always fight;  
Distorted Back I have, and earthen Scrip;  
Black is my Face, and blubber’d is my Lip:  
No Eyes have I, and yet I always weep;  
Sleeping I wake, and waking I do sleep.  
  
F.A.W.
