<div class="author">Communicated by Mr Vignoles</div>

In jerkin short, and nut brown coat I live;  
Pleasure to all, and pain to all I give:  
Quivers I have, and painted arrows too;  
Gold in my dart, and iron in my shoe:  
I never eat, and yet I’m always full;  
Poisons from herbs, and sweets from flow’rs I cull;  
I never read, yet often times I write;  
I never go to war, yet always fight;  
Distorted back I have, and earthen scrip;  
Black is my face, and blubber’d is my lip:  
No eyes have I, and yet I always weep;  
Sleeping I wake, and waking I do sleep.  
  
F.A.W.
