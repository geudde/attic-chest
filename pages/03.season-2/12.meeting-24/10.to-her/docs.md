Soon, too soon will come the day  
When I must hasten far away  
&emsp;And bid to thee adieu, Love;  
But I will ne’er till mem’ry cease  
Forget thou set’st my heart at ease  
&emsp;And told’st me thou wert true, Love

I’ll never forget thy tender sighs,  
The tears that started from thine eyes,  
The throbbings of thy heart, Love;  
&emsp;The soft, the sweet seducing smile  
That mantled on thy cheeks the while  
&emsp;Thou said’st “We’l never part, Love.”

But dearest, when I’m far away  
Wilt thou one anxious wish betray  
&emsp;To call me back again, Love?  
Oh yes! I know thou’s keenly feel  
But wilt thy cherish’d woes conceal  
&emsp;Nor tell the world thy pain, Love.
