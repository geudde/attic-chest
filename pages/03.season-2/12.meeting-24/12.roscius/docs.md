The following authentic story has been put in rhyme merely because the contrast between the *Matter* & the *Manner* offered a fair subject for a laugh, & not with the slightest idea of depreciating the abilities of Mr. Kemble of whose dramatic talents, in their peculiar line of excellence, the writer is a fervent admirer.  
  
The success on recital chiefly depends on the imitation of the inflections & cadences peculiar to the voice of the Modern Roscius.  
  
Reader! Wilt hear and after-dinner story?  
My Muse I fear, will tell it but so-so,  
&emsp;But what it is I trow,  
If that you list, you soon will know,  
&emsp;Since it lays right before you.  
  
Fame says our modern Roscius oft has told  
This tale: and thence ’tis somewhat old,  
&emsp;Great Mister Kemble!  
At whose dread nod inferior actors tremble.  
&emsp;Whose solemn, insubstantial prose,  
&emsp;In undulating period flows,  
Whose style in short, is any thing but terse,  
&emsp;Whose oratory is almost divine,  
But ne’er till now, had it been sung in verse,  
&emsp;That sin is mine.  
Now Reader! lest thy patience fail,  
Our Roscius shall begin the tale.  
  
> *As issuing from my door in Russell Street  
> Lord Willoughby de Broke, I chanced to meet  
> And when Lord Willoughby de Broke  
> Had spoke  
> And I had bow’d,  
> Three times as low as to the vulgar crowd.*
