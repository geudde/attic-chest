The Men have *many* Faults  
Poor Women have but two  
There’s nothing right they say  
There’s nothing right they do!  
  
To Lysander  
  
Why thus against the Sex declaim  
And female worth deride?  
Reflect from where their failings came  
And check thy haughty pride,  
Reflect that Eve no mother knew,  
From *Man* *she* sprang alone,  
And while from Man her *errors* grew,  
Her *virtues* were her own.
