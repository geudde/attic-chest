### To Timon & Lysander  
  
<span class="pencil">Timon required the faults of man to be enumerated, at the same time stating them to be few.</span>  
  
1  
  
Mistaken youth to dare assert  
&emsp;Thy sex’s faults are slight and few  
The ladies’ faults may numerous prove  
&emsp;But man I fear has more to rue  
  
2  
  
Though ignorance bound our minds in chains  
&emsp;So long, by your unjust command  
(Forbade our fame to free from stains)  
&emsp;The pen alone adorn’d your hand  
  
3  
  
Yet now in George’s golden days  
&emsp;And now in Britain’s happy isle  
On either sex, with equal grace  
&emsp;The lovely muses deign to smile  
  
4  
  
And as (when for a while restrained)  
&emsp;More fierce the torrent holds its course  
So dread our freedom now regain’d  
&emsp;Lest we retort with triple force  

5  
  
Yet no, our gentler minds delight  
&emsp;With love and praise the air to fill  
Like honey sweet our numbers flow  
&emsp;Clear as Pieria’s crystal rill  
  
6  
  
Yet pursuant now to your request  
&emsp;I seize the martial lance and shield  
And now to lower your haughty crest  
&emsp;The pointed darts of Satyr wield  
  
7  
  
Man is ambitions, jealous, proud  
&emsp;For base ingratitude renown’d  
Be *faults alone* to us allow’d  
&emsp;In man the *blacker crimes* abound  
  
8  
  
Though fabling bards our sex may name  
&emsp;“The wavering race of woman kind”  
Your sex deserves no brighter fame  
&emsp;For man we more inconstant find  
  
9  
  
Or if our blackened fame has spread  
&emsp;Renown’d for art and crafty wiles  
Say dwells less cunning in your head  
&emsp;Lurks poison lip beneath your smiles  
  
10  
  
If woman kind should envious prove  
&emsp;Say does in man less envy dwell  
If cruelty our sex may love  
&emsp;Say is not man more fierce more fell  
  
11  
  
And if as wintry torrents loud  
&emsp;The eloquence of woman kind  
Fierce as the bursting thunder cloud  
&emsp;The stormy tongues of man we find  
  
12  
  
If of their charms our sex were vain  
&emsp;Take to yourselves alone the shame  
Your envious soul your selfish mind  
&emsp;And your tyrannic conduct blame  
  
13  
  
For (though this truth may bitter prove)  
&emsp;Know that to us by bounteous heaven  
Of whom alike we share the love  
&emsp;An equal soul with yours was given  
  
14  
  
Save gentler far our minds were made  
&emsp;By that our weaker frames to suit  
In us the softer passions more  
&emsp;In man the ruder have their root  
  
15  
  
Thus formed alike, companions meet  
&emsp;While joys alone their time engage  
They lived a while a life so sweet  
&emsp;It since was called, “The Golden Age”  
  
16  
  
But soon unblest oppression rose  
&emsp;With brazen brow and iron hand  
Strait to the stronger sex he goes  
&emsp;And bids usurp unjust command  
  
17  
  
There tyrant man inflamed by pride  
&emsp;(As still in barbarous climes we find)  
To our sad sex a soul denied  
&emsp;And said that woman had no mind  
  
18  
  
But like the insects of a day  
&emsp;When this their mortal race was o’er  
The flame that animates their clay  
&emsp;Expired alas to rise no more  
  
19  
  
And thence they strove not to improve  
&emsp;A mind whose being they denied  
To woman inward light refused  
&emsp;Her outward charms were all her pride  
  
20  
  
Then our unhappy sex became  
&emsp;Giddy coquettish proud and vain  
’Till true religion’s sacred beam  
&emsp;To us restored our souls again  
  
21  
  
And hence tho’ fairest of the fair  
&emsp;The British dames lip vain we find  
None with their outward charms compare  
&emsp;None with the beauties of their mind
