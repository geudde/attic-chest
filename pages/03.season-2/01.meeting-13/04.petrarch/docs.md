#### To the Fountain of Valchinsa  
  
&emsp;Ye clear & sparkling streams,  
&emsp;Warmed by the sunny beams,  
Through whose transparent chrystal Laura play’d;  
&emsp;Ye boughs, that deck the grove,  
&emsp;Where Spring her chaplets wove,  
While Laura lay beneath the quivering shade;  
&emsp;Sweet herbs, & blooming flowers  
&emsp;That crown yon vernal bowers  
Forever fatal, yet forever dear:  
&emsp;And ye, that heard my sighs  
&emsp;When first she charmed my eyes,  
Soft breathing Gales, my dying accents hear.  
&emsp;If heaven has fix’d my doom,  
&emsp;That Love must quite consume  
My bursting Heart, & close my Eyes in death;  
&emsp;Ah! grant this slight request,  
&emsp;That here my Urn may rest  
When to its Mansion flies my vital breath.  
&emsp;This pleasing Hope will smooth  
&emsp;My Anxious Mind, & sooth  
The pangs of that inevitable Hour;  
&emsp;My spirit will not grieve  
&emsp;Her mortal Vale to leave  
In these calm Shades, and this enchanting Bower.  
&emsp;Haply the guilty maid  
&emsp;Through yon accustom’d glade  
To my sad Tomb will take her lonely way,  
&emsp;Where first her Beauty’s light  
&emsp;O’erpower’d my dazzled sight,  
When Love on this fair border bad me stray:  
&emsp;There sorrowing shall she see,  
&emsp;Beneath an aged tree,  
Her true but hapless Lover’s lowly bier;  
&emsp;Too late her tender sighs  
&emsp;Shall melt the pitying skies,  
And her soft veil shall hide the gushing tear.  
&emsp;O! well-remember’d day,  
&emsp;When on yon bank she lay  
Meek in her Pride, and in her rigour mild;  
&emsp;The young & blooming flowers,  
&emsp;Falling in fragrant showers,  
Shone on her neck, and on [her] Bosom smil’d:  
&emsp;Some on her mantle hung,  
&emsp;Some in her Locks were strung,  
Like orient Gems in rings of flaming gold;  
&emsp;Some in a spicy cloud  
&emsp;Descending, call’d aloud  
“Here Love & youth the Reins of empire hold.”  
&emsp;I view’d the heavenly maid,  
&emsp;And, rapt in wonder, said  
“The Groves of Eden gave this Angel birth;”  
&emsp;Her look, her voice, her smile,  
&emsp;That might all Heaven beguile,  
Wafted my soul above the Realms of Earth:  
&emsp;The star-bespangled skies  
&emsp;Were open’d to my eyes;  
Sighing I said, “Whence rose this glittering scene?”  
&emsp;Since that auspicious hour,  
&emsp;This bank, and Od’rous bower,  
My morning couch, & evening haunt has been.  
&emsp;Well may’st thou blush, my song,  
&emsp;To leave the rural throng,  
And fly thus artless to my Laura’s Ear;  
&emsp;But were thy Poet’s fire  
&emsp;Ardent as his desire,  
Thou wert a Song that Heaven might stoop to hear.
