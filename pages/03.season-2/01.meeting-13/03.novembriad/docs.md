November dull! — oh much misjudging world!  
The month fair pleasure’s banner is unfurl’d  
The month she smiles in each smug city face  
And calls to dinner, with so sweet a grace.  
And not to dinner only, does she call  
She gives the ladies and the beaux a ball  
That those who eat and those who dance may share  
The feast & riddle of the good Lord Mayor.  
November dull! again surpris’d I cry  
So might as well be said November’s sky  
Is dark and gloomy & and that no bright sun  
Informs us citizens the day’s begun —  
Nay some may add, that fog & London smoke  
Are noisome both, but these must speak in joke  
For when the vapour rises thick & brown  
Veiling the beauties of the Eastern Town  
Thrice happy he who trotting on the road  
A gust invited to some friend’s abode  
Hails the sure omen of the coming feast  
And snuffs the gale & spurs his tired beast  
So when some timid but yet curious wight  
Hath climb’d a hill to view the dreadful fight  
There sitting snug, secure, & wrapt in cloak  
See where the battle rages by the smoke —  
  
> “The gloomy month of November  
When Englishmen hang or drown themselves”  
  
But sure, — the month that to our Isle did bring  
William of Orange, patriotic king —  
To every British bosom must be dear  
And prove an antidote to fell despair  
The great Eliza too, who graced our throne  
In this same month acceded to the crown  
That thought alone, might warm a Briton’s heart  
And love of life & cheerfulness impart —  
Let us not here forget the tale to tell  
That in the first King James’s reign befell  
But hold! ’twere needless to relate the plot  
By patriot school boys ne’er to be forgot!  
Whilst still amidst the little shouting throng  
Grim visaged Guy, is borne in state along  
Whilst squibs & crackers, every boy’s delight  
And blazing bonfires crown’d the noisy night.  
Now gentle muse, e’en let the faggots burn  
While we, shall to a theme more pleasing turn,  
Though the last mention’d yet I deem it best,  
The annual meeting of the Attic Chest.  
When friendly cuties merciful & kind  
Praise where they can, while to our faults they’re blind,  
The summons all attend with one consent  
By proxy some, but not one non-content.  
  
The Lord Mayor’s Fool
