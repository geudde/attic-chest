Early, on the rock’s bare summit  
I with fixed eyes sat looking,  
On the fog, which like grey canvass  
Kept all things around concealed.  
See a boy came, stood by my shoulder,  
Said, “Why friend art thou thus staring  
Coldly on the empty canvass  
Hast thou lost thy joy in painting,  
Lost thy love of art for ever?”  
Looking on the boy, I whisper’d  
“Will that child too play the master  
Mournfully and idly sitting?”  
Says the boy, “Will profit nothing  
See, I’ll make at once a picture  
I will teach thee how to paint too,”  
And he stretched his fore-finger  
Like a rose-bud it was glowing  
On the wide outstretched canvas  
With the tip of his finger drawing  
On the top a sun he painted  
Trees of heart enlivening freshness  
And a group of distant mountains,  
Gently rose above each other.  
And below, a stream was flowing  
So like nature, that the river  
Seem’d to sparkle in the sun beams  
And to beat against the borders.  
Flowers too were in the river  
Colours glittered in the meadow  
Gold and green and blue and purple  
Look’d like emeralds and rubies  
To the sky he then proceeded,  
Light and clear and bright he made it  
And the blue hills in the distance.  
I was lost in joy beholding  
Now the painting, now the painter.  
“Have I not,” says he, “now proved  
That I too can hold the pencil  
But the best is still remaining.”  
Then he drew with pointed finger  
By the wood with utmost niceness  
Where the sun with might was shining  
From the bright soil was reflected  
There he drew the sweetest maiden  
Tightly clad and finely formed  
Fresh cheeks under auburn ringlets  
And her cheeks were of the colour  
Of the finger which had drawn them.  
“Oh thou boy,” I cried, “What master  
Has taught thee so wise a lesson,  
That with such skill and such nature  
Thou couldst plan and end thy picture?”  
And behold as I was speaking  
Rises softly a faint zephyr  
Gently moving the tree’s branches  
Curls the waves upon the river  
Swells the veil of the sweet maiden  
And — which sets me more in wonder  
She the maiden is in motion  
To the spot she is approaching,  
Where the boy and I are sitting;  
Now that all things were in motion,  
Trees and river, veil & flowers  
And the soft foot of the maiden  
Dost thou think now that I idly  
Rock like, on my rock remained?
