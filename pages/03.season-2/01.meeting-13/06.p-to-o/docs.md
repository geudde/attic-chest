&emsp;Says a P to an O,  
&emsp;On the hat of a Beau,  
Which long had defied stormy weather,  
&emsp;In sooth lovely O,  
&emsp;The cause I’d fair know,  
That brings you and me here together.  
  
&emsp;I came here forlorn  
&emsp;From the alphabet torn  
To heighten the manager’s grief,  
&emsp;And I says the O,  
&emsp;On a like errand go,  
Tis to good McMeinhall relief.  
  
&emsp;Ah! so so says the P,  
&emsp;The cause I well see,  
We both are old Dilcoorth’s abettors;  
&emsp;And whenever O.P.  
&emsp;On the hat band we see  
The wearer is learning his Letters.
