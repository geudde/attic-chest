Luna, whilst o’er yon eastern barrier mounting  
With stately step, and face serenely bright,  
Thou looks’t as grave, and silent, as if counting  
The little stars that stud the brow of Night.  
  
Thy head reclining on a cloudy pillow  
Thou seems’t to listen to the whisp’ring gale  
Now piercing through a pendant shade of Willow  
Thy glance pursues the streamlet of the Vale.  
  
And now behind some dusky vapour’s awning  
In frolic mood thou seem’st to skulk from view,  
That thy full charms in heighten’d splendor dawning  
May strike the disappointed sight anew.  
  
To pleasingly coquetish is thy motion  
E’en stupid Darkness, it, delights to see,  
No wonder, that an object of devotion  
Oh lovely Wand’rer! Heathens reckon’d thee, *Endymion*.
