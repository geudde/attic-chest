> A Translation
of the sixteenth Ode
of Anacreon

You may sing the Theban War  
Or how the Grecians from afar  
Led their ships to Phrygia’s strand  
How bravely fought the Trojan band.  
Not such your poet overthrew,  
New were their arms their warfare new  
No horse, no footmen fill’d their ranks  
No rowers mann’d the trireme’s banks;  
Anacreon here, a captive lies  
Conquer’d by shafts from female eyes.  

Ictinus
