> On passing under the stern of the Gorgon 44 Gun Ship

Terrific name! who’ll dare come near thee  
Friends as well as foes must fear thee  
*Gorgon!* thy enemies will cry  
And from thy winged bullets fly  
While friends thy name will backward read  
And from thy thirsty bark recede.  
For thus, exclaims each waggish dog  
I’ll board no ship where there’s *No Grog*  

My first in French is always bad,   
My next appears with snow,  
My whole is what you never had,  
And may you never know.

For the Attic Chest
