Since now the blush of modest merit prais’d,  
On his cold cheek can never more be rais’d;  
Since rapt’rous to repeat his virtues o’er,  
Can agonize his humble ear no more:  
Since it no more, his honest heart can wound,  
To say *that* heart was ever faultless found:  
To say he always spoke the truths he thought;  
Aim’d to do well, and gain’d the end he sought:  
To say how warm a friend! a son how kind!  
In ease, how thankful! anguish, how resign’d!  
Since now, no pain, this well deserv’d applause  
Can to his meek and happy spirit cause;  
Truth to his worth this grateful tribute pays,  
For Truth he lov’d, in ev’ry Form, but Praise.

William Jackson
