Anna — before tomorrow’s sun with cheering ray  
Shall gild the East, and give the promised day,  
Thy hapless Lover sails upon the main  
No more to see his Love, his Home again!  
For the last time, around thy dwelling  
He wanders lonely, each fond fancy telling  
&emsp;To every passing gale!  

Ah! cold the passing gale that fans thy cheek  
Half the deep anguish of this bosom speak,  
Would trembling drops of pity dim thy eye  
And for my sorrows wouldst thou heave the sigh?  
Hence idle thought! for me no tears would flow.  
Rest then, unconscious of my careless woe!  
&emsp;Be silent gentle gale!  

Yet my loved Anna, at some pensive hour  
When the pale moon-beam lights thy favorite bower  
Think the sad murmurs issuing from the grove  
Like the last sighs of one who dies for love!  
Think the light breeze that curls the silvery wave  
Sweeps the long grass that decks thy lover’s grave!  
&emsp;On a far distant shore!
