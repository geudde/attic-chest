Beneath this stone, that vies with snows pure white,  
&emsp;Reclines a maid of beauty, virtue rare,  
Her blushing charms just opening met the light,  
&emsp;Then closed for ever on this world of care.

Oft have I seen the tender rose unfold,  
&emsp;Its budding beauties to the smiling morn,  
Oft have I wept at evening, to behold  
&emsp;Its tender blossom by rude tempests torn.  
Sigh’d to behold at morn what deck’d the vale  
At eve so mangled, scattered by the gale.
