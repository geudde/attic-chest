> A Free Imitation of the Earl of Surrey’s Description of Spring, wherein each thing renews, save only the lover.

Again return’d, reviving spring  
&emsp;With verdure decks the hill and dale,  
The nightingales new feather’d sing  
&emsp;The doves renew their am’rous tale.

The swallows swift the flies pursue  
&emsp;From teeming earth fair flowers arise  
Display their forms of beauteous hue  
&emsp;And breathe their perfumes to the skies.  

The busy bees their stories collect  
&emsp;From herbs whose fragrance scents the gale;  
All smile but me my fair’s neglect  
&emsp;Oppressed with woe I rove the vale.

There I the smiling landscape view,  
&emsp;The trees new rob’d the gladsome skies;  
Thus, spring, which nature’s woes subdues,  
&emsp;My sorrow strengthens, swells my sighs.
