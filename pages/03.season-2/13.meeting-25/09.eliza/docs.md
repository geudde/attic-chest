<div class="author">Communicated by Miss Flaxman</div>

Is it anger, Maiden, speak  
That glows upon that redd’ning cheek  
And flashes from thy speaking eye  
Because I call’d thee Butterfly?  
Know, thou chosen of my heart  
’Tis emblem of th’immortal part,  
Let reason, Sweet, thy wrath control  
For *Thou*, Eliza, *art all Soul!*  

Yorick
