“That female virtues great and small  
So infinitely many  
Are all compris’d within the space  
Of one small silver penny!”

Can this be deem’d a riddle, Sir, by you  
A thing so evident, so plain, so true!  
Only Sir Knight bear this plain fact in mind  
That “Female Virtues” are of softer kind  
Their likeness here to Indian Goods you trace  
Those of the finest texture take the smallest space!  
You hint ’tis on the needle’s point  
That female virtues shine —  
Most true, for still the needle is  
*Of Constancy* the sign!  
And that’s a *female virtue* Sir  
*The Women* all agree,  
Some Men indeed have doubted it —  
What incredulity!  
To prove to you that I’m no slave  
To *custom* when absurd —  
My sex’s privilege I waive  
I wish not the *last word!*
