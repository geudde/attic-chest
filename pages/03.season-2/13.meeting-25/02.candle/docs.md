Little Candle snuff’d too low!  
Ah! I felt the fatal blow,  
I saw the ruffian snuffer’s rise,  
He marked thee for his savage prize  
And stretching wide his sable jaw  
Gorg’d thee in his hungry maw.  
I felt thy agony of woe  
Little Candle snuff’d too low!

Little Candle snuff’d too low!  
All thy grief I’m doom’d to know,  
In thy sorrow beaming eye  
The starting tear, alas! I spy  
Now in grief you melt away  
I feel the sympathetic sway  
Dear sensibility’s fine flow  
Pretty Candle snuff’d too low!  

Little Candle snuff’d too low!  
Do not, do not, leave me so —  
Ah! thine eye is waxing dim  
They mould so fine, they shape so slim,  
Deform’d and haggard now appears  
Ah! stop those unavailing tears  
Nor out alas! despairing go  
Mournful Candle snuff’d too low!  

Little Candle snuff’d too low!  
Now returning life you show  
Fire rekindles in thine eye  
No more you heave the sanguine sigh  
Now again thy beauties shine  
The joy is yours, they joy is mine.  
I feel the sympathetic glow  
Recover’d from the snuff too low!
