&emsp;Now while the Dewdrop “glistens on the thorn,”  
&emsp;And crimson tinted clouds announce the morn,  
Peeping at mortals o’er the mountain’s height;  
Come Madam Muse, prepare to take a flight  
&emsp;And while we range the skies together;  
&emsp;You need not fear to meet bad weather;  
And sure there’s time enough ’tween this and night?  

&emsp;And now well mounted on Pegasus’ back,  
&emsp;Let us disdainful of the beaten track,  
Shew to you wond’ring men the true sublime;   
Fools! that stand doubting half afraid to climb  
&emsp;Up steep Parnassus far fam’d mountain,  
&emsp;To taste that pure Pierian fountain,  
That teaches moon-struck poets how to rhyme.  

&emsp;We’ll strike a road as yet to man unknown,  
&emsp;A nearer one by half t’Apollo’s throne;  
One, never to be pass’d by man again,  
One, like a ship’s course through the swelling main,  
&emsp;Whose waves across her deep track flowing,  
&emsp;Conceal from all the way it’s going,  
And those who seek it, seek for it in vain.  

&emsp;Truly this voyage have I been *forc’d* to take,  
&emsp;And now ’tis made; I think those for whose sake  
I made it, will not thank me for my pain:  
Indeed I’m sure they’ll by it nothing gain!  
&emsp;But, Ladies, this fatigue of writing,  
&emsp;(When brains are tired of inditing)  
Will pardon me for writing in this strain.

&emsp;Perhaps next year supplied with fresher wit,  
&emsp;My shallow brain may make a luckier hit,  
My voyage may finish with some happy prize;  
And when I come rejoicing from the skies,  
&emsp;I’ll bring you such Poetic Poesies,  
&emsp;Such Lilies, Violets, Cowslips, Roses,  
Ladies, you’ll scarce believe your Ears and Eyes!!!
