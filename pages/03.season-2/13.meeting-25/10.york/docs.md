> Written on the great steeple of York Minster. Sept 1792

While from this height sublime in prospect wide  
&emsp;Old Ebor’s vales and streets and streets appear,  
And time-worn walls and towers, her antient pride;  
&emsp;Why swells my heart? why starts th’unconscious tear?  
Ah, once loved scenes and still to fancy dear!  
&emsp;You memory’s faithful registers unroll,  
Recall the joys of many a long past year,  
&emsp;And lave in sweetest sorrow all my sole:  
There first Lavinia’s warblings charm’d my ear,  
&emsp;There first I viewed with rapture Laura’s face,  
There Mason deign’d my artless rhymes to hear,  
&emsp;And there reposes one in death’s embrace,  
Whose image never from my heart shall fade,  
&emsp;Till low in dust like his these failing limbs are laid.
