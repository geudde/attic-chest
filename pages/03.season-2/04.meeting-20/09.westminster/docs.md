&emsp;As Holes where thieves have lurk’d all Day  
&emsp;Emit at Night, upon the Lay,  
Their Darkness loving Race,  
&emsp;So now each Inn about the Town  
&emsp;Lets out its tribes with Wig and gown  
To haunt this *Gothic* place.  
&emsp;What heights of sable sweep along  
&emsp;What Groves of Curls and what a throng  
Of little dangling tails!  
&emsp;It is no wonder such a *sight* [^1]  
&emsp;Should oft put Justice in a Fright  
and her *her drop* her Scales  
&emsp;’Tis said from paradice when hurl’d,  
&emsp;That Satan visited this world:  
And, to begin our woes,  
&emsp;He sow’d a Hellish seed called Strife,  
&emsp;Which vegetated into Life —  
When up a Lawyer rose!  

&emsp;He lodg’d him in a spacious place:  
&emsp;That it might wear a holy Trace  
He call’d the spot “The Temple”:  
&emsp;And rather than a <span data-tippy="Illegible" class="red">[???]</span> for sign,  
&emsp;Plac’d on the Door a Lamb divine [^2]  
As of his Trade a sample.  
  
&emsp;When thus set up, he thought a wife  
&emsp;Would much assist his rise in Life  
And soon he found a Prize —  
&emsp;A Mrs Falshood, who before  
&emsp;Had large host of Children bore —  
Call’d by the vulgar “Lies.”  
  
&emsp;These he adopted — brought up all:  
&emsp;And, I am told, within this Hall  
They first were put to School:  
&emsp;He taught them Quibbling as they grew  
&emsp;And from the Dam: ’tis very true  
They learned to *over-rule*.  

&emsp;They cheated, prosper’d, and increas’d;  
&emsp;Nor has their population ceas’d,  
As you may here descry:  
&emsp;And, as the Issue has not fail’d,  
&emsp;I fear the Curse will be entail’d  
On all Posterity!  
  
&emsp;But still to them some praise is due  
&emsp;With filial Duty they pursue  
The origin of evil  
&emsp;And Labour still with hand & tongue  
&emsp;To prove the Sion where they sprung  
Was planted by the Devil.
