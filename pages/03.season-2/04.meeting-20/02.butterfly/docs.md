Born in Aspasia’s fost’ring land  
&emsp;My finish’d form I first display’d  
And felt my plumy wings expand  
&emsp;While gazing on the beauteous maid.  
  
No sunshine glow’d upon the scene  
&emsp;With gentle warmth those wings to dry:  
Yet fair each painted pinion grew  
&emsp;Beneath the lustre of her eye.  
  
No zephyr rose with gentle gale  
&emsp;To fill my infant frame with air;  
But fann’d by fair Aspasia’s breath,  
&emsp;The zephyr’s gale I well migth spare.  
  
No rose or lily near me grea  
&emsp;In which my downy limbs might rest;  
But these in brighter tints I found  
&emsp;On the fair virgin’s face & breast.  
  
Thus Nature with indulgent care  
   Propitious grac’d my natal hour;  
And with superior sweetness gave  
   The gale, the sunshine, and the Flow’r!
