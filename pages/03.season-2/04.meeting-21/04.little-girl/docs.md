Sweet Rose bud! promise of the fairest flower  
May no rude Storm thy calm retreat invade  
No ruthless foes thy growing charms devour  
Or secret canker cause thy bloom to fade.  
May no rough hand untimely, rudely tear  
Thy tender blossom from its parent stem  
May none regardless of a flower so fair  
To cold neglect thy drooping sweets condemn.  
But when at length thine op’ning charms expand  
Matured by summer Suns and genial Skies  
May’st thou be gather’d by his gentle hand  
Who owns those charms, and knows thy worth to prize,  
Fond may he place thee to his heaving breast  
Sweet rose Bud! proud to hail so fair a guest.
