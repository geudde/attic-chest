Nicol whom Heaven hath blest with wine and oil  
Proud steeds, a spacious house, and gardens fair  
And eke released from thrift and sordid toil  
Which he who lacketh Fortune’s gifts must bear  
Whether thou por’st on Coke with studious air  
Or to thy white buck wed’st the virgin doe  
Or dreams’t of woolsacks in thine elbow chair  
Or mark’st how sunshine makes the turnips grow  
One moment on thy rambling friend bestow  
Now posting from the fiend with haggard eye  
Hight poverty that dogs him to and fro  
And faster follows as he faster flies  
Oh think on him whate’er thy task may be  
Who in this doubtful race still kindly thinks on thee.
