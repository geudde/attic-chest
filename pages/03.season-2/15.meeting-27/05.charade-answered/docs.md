When the proud Galley down the Cydnus moved  
And bore the Queen of Antony beloved  
A lovely Syren did the Vessel guide  
While silver oars the *Water* did divide  
This is the *first*, the second I shall name  
The noble Captive of the Egyptian Dame  
A Net she spread (forbear its force to scan)  
Which caught alive the noble biped *“Man”*  
The whole is deem’d in every nation  
A very vulgar occupation  
But Sappho thought not so, for if she’s not belied  
’Twas for a *“Waterman”* the Lesbian died!
