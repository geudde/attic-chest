When the proud galley down the Cydnus moved  
And bore the queen of Antony beloved  
A lovely syren did the vessel guide  
While silver oars the *water* did divide  
This is the *first*, the second I shall name  
The noble captive of the Egyptian dame  
A net she spread (forbear its force to scan)  
Which caught alive the noble biped *“Man”*  
The whole is deem’d in every nation  
A very vulgar occupation  
But Sappho thought not so, for if she’s not belied  
’Twas for a *“Waterman”* the Lesbian died!
