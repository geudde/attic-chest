“A plain gold Ring’s a serious thing,  
What think you Lady fair?”  
  
“A gay gold Ring’s a dainty thing  
And fit for Lady fair,  
If *right* Swain bring, the gay gold Ring  
’Tis meet for Lady’s wear.”  
  
“But if the Ring, some Lout should bring  
What says the Lady fair?”  
  
“You stupid thing, I hate a Ring  
’Tis what I never wear —”  
  
“Nay Ma’am the Ring is no bad thing  
With Diamond Hoops a pair!”  
  
“If *those* you bring, I’ll try the Ring  
’Tis pretty, I declare!”
