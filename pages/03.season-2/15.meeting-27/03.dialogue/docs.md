“A plain gold ring’s a serious thing,  
What think you lady fair?”  
  
“A gay gold ring’s a dainty thing  
And fit for lady fair,  
If *right* swain bring, the gay gold ring  
’Tis meet for lady’s wear.”  
  
“But if the ring, some lout should bring  
What says the lady fair?”  
  
“You stupid thing, I hate a ring  
’Tis what I never wear —”  
  
“Nay ma’am the ring is no bad thing  
With diamond hoops a pair!”  
  
“If *those* you bring, I’ll try the ring  
’Tis pretty, I declare!”
