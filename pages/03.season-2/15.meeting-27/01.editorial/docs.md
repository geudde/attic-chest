We open our reading with a note from Incognita who seems to have strangely misapprehended our expression in the last Editorial remarks, when she supposed us to mean that she had “said or sung” enough, as it so very obvious that we advised her to think twice before she resigned the sex’s privilege to have on all occasions the *last word*. Should this answer be overheard “by the trusty Moth” we hope that she will speedily flutter with it to Incognita that the maiden’s rest may not be disturbed by unfounded surmises and that by knowing our genuine meaning she may be induced “again and often” to give us *more last words*. We have received some verses from 1810 in which he appears to consider that the ladies will lose nothing by resigning the last word, or smiles, and looks, will answer their purpose equally well. We agree with him, and believe these substitutes will preserve their empire over the male part of the Creation much longer than a disputatious spirit that will never be silenced. In this sense it may be said that they “Stoop to Conquer”. Our wise correspondent — our Solomon 1810 — seems inclined by the symbols at the bottom of his verses, to put an extinguisher on Female Faults, and knock under to the Ladies.

The Dialogue about the ring  
&emsp;Twixt swain and Lady fair  
Whether a diamond ring or plain  
Should be presented by the swain  
&emsp;Is pretty *we declare*  
Whoever brings  
A Pair of rings  
&emsp;Both meet for Lady’s wear  
We think her wise  
*That one* to prize  
&emsp;Most fit for Lady fair  
If Lout should bring —  
The Diamond ring  
&emsp;Is best of Lady’s wear  
A handsome swain —  
To choose the plain,  
&emsp;Is wise for Lady fair  
	
We have received a neat answer to Amintor’s riddle and to the Charade by C. J. F. and some pretty lines given to a young lady with a ring of Gold chain. We have also a sprightly composition of Wit and Humour which concludes with a compliment to a fair Lady, (who it is we know not) but she who the cap fits may put it on.

A new subject has arisen which by the number of compositions we have received promises to be a fruitful one. They relate to a misfortune that has lately befallen some damsel while collecting shells and shining pebbles on the sea shore. They are entitled, “The Lady’s Lament” “The Complaint of the Sylpho” “The impatient Griorne” “The plighted Lady” and “The Rape of the Veil”. The two latter we shall present this evening, the others are under consideration.

“Incognita” takes the liberty of requesting an explanation from the Editor and Editress of what was meant by desiring her in the “Editorial remarks” to take “The Last Word” into her *serious consideration* — Is she to understand by it that she has *nearly* “said or sung” enough, and therefore her *“Last Word”* is required speedily? Or is it that she has *quite* “said or sung” enough and the Editor & Editress *require no more*. Incognita begs they will take her request into *their* “serious consideration” and solve her doubts on the subject. An answer from the Editress (after having consulted her co-adjutor) if given to the charge of the trusty *Moth* will be properly deliverd.
