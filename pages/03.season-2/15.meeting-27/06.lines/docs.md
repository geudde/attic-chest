<div class="author">Miss Flaxman</div>

May ev’ry link that forms this slender chain  
Some guardian sylph in gentle bonds retain,  
To hover near thee, and to shield thee still  
From ev’ry harm, from e’en the *thought* of ill!  
So may this circlet dearest maiden prove  
Symbol of *Union*, *Purity*, and *Love!*
