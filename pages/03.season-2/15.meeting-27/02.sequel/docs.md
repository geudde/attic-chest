<div class="author">Communicated by Miss Flaxman</div>

If Sheba’s gay queen gave the point up so smooth,  
*Her* Example can ne’er by inferr’d;  
For she — good lady-like — held out while she had breath,  
Suspecting no man would have talked her to death;  
So, compell’d — she renounc’d — *The Last Word.*  
  
Hence, before ’tis too late, prithee, stop the rash act,  
Or your sex will be quickly interr’d:  
For as death doth sure silence sweet Philomel’s throat,  
So extinction must follow your principal note,  
In renouncing your life —  *The Last Word.*  
  
“Hush, hush — simple friend — cease officious advice,”  
Say the Ladies — 1st, 2nd & 3rd  
“For know — while our sex can exert *smiles* or *looks*  
We defy all the wisdom you get from your books,  
And can *manage* without —  *The Last Word.*
