If Sheba’s gay Queen gave the point up so smooth,  
*Her* Example can ne’er by inferr’d;  
For She — good Lady-like — held out while she had breath,  
Suspecting no Man would have talked her to death;  
So, compell’d — she renounc’d — *The Last Word.*  
  
Hence, before ’tis too late, prithee, stop the rash act,  
Or your Sex will be quickly interr’d:  
For as death doth sure silence sweet Philomel’s throat,  
So Extinction must follow your principla Note,  
In renouncing your Life —  *The Last Word.*  
  
“Hush, hush — simple Friend — cease officious Advice,”  
Say the Ladies — 1st, 2nd & 3rd  
“For know — while our Sex can exert *Smiles* or *Looks*  
We defy all the Wisdom you get from your Books,  
And can *manage* without —  *The Last Word.*
