<div class="author">Miss Flaxman</div>

Oh ’tis a sigh, I know it well  
And ev’ry line its name doth tell,  
Sure when it springs from joy, ’tis sweet  
From grief — its bitterness is great,  
And when the heart is charg’d with woe  
The *sigh* may transient ease bestow  
A “special pleader,” let no lawyer frown  
But rather smile, and all its influence own,  
An inmate of the bosom though it dwells  
Ne’er issues forth but it some secret tells!  
It is a *“messenger”* may pass a host,  
And gets an answer quicker than the post,  
’Tis not a “spy,” that’s very clear  
And when it goes a volunteer  
I rather doubt, ’tis not sincere.  
I’ve said enough, Amintor knows the rest  
And dedicates his sighs where likes him best!
