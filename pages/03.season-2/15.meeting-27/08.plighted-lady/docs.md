Inspire me Lewis, while I sing
Of th’ enamour’d “Water King”
Or rather, do *thou* tell the tale
Of the lady’s stolen veil,
*Thou* know’s to mix thy lore terrific,
As ’Pothecaries mix their physic,
And to disguise what’s pois’nous in’t
Thou puttest romantic peppermint.
Of thee in vain, the boon I ask,
Then *I* must undertake the task.

Now water kelpies round me rise
And glare upon me with their eyes!
Down yelping fiends, while I unfold
The tale ye wish not to be told.
But out alas! my wits they scare
I cannot stand their horrid stare!
They threaten me with open jaws
(And much I fear their teeth & claws.)
If I their thieving pranks should tell
In cities I must ever dwell,
And never on the water’s brink
Dare with “the Muse to sit & think.”

But though I must not, *dare* not say
What happen’d but the other day
I sure may give a hint or so
To warn the ladies where they go!

Ye damsels who approach the sea
And think yourselves at liberty
To pick up mussel-shells & shrimps
Bethink ye of the water imps!
Who watch at their stern king’s behest
For lady who may please *him* best
Who when at last they think they’ve found
In form of zephyr’s they surround
In seeming wanton play they steal
Some riband, or perhaps a veil!
And if the *last*, no hand can save her
The Water King is sure to have her!
It binds her to him like a spell
He bears her to his rocky cell!
And ah! dear lady who can help ye
When married to grim water kelpie!!!
