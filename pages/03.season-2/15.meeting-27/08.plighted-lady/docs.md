Inspire me Lewis, while I sing
Of th’enamour’d “Water King”
Or rather, do *thou* tell the Tale
Of the Lady’s stolen Veil,
*Thou* know’s to mix thy lore terrific,
As ’Pothecaries mix their Physic,
And to disguise what’s pois’nous in’t
Thou puttest romantic Peppermint.
Of thee in vain, the boon I ask,
Then *I* must undertake the task.

Now Water Kelpies round me rise
And glare upon me with their eyes!
Down yelping Fiends, while I unfold
The Tale ye wish not to be told.
But out Alas! my wits they scare
I cannot stand their horrid stare!
They threaten me with open jaws
(And much I fear their teeth & claws.)
If I their thieving pranks should tell
In Cities I must ever dwell,
And never on the Water’s brink
Dare with “the Muse to sit & think.”

But though I must not, *dare* not say
What happen’d but the other day
I sure may give a hint or so
To warn the Ladies where they go !

Ye Damsels who approach the Sea
And think yourselves at liberty
To pick up Mussel-Shells & Shrimps
Bethink ye of the Water Imps!
Who watch at their stern King’s behest
For Lady who may please *him* best
Who when at last they think they’ve found
In form of Zephyr’s they surround
In seeming wanton play they steal
Some Ribband, or perhaps a Veil!
And if the *last*, no hand can save her
The Water King is sure to have her!
It binds her to him like a spell
He bears her to his rocky Cell!
And Ah! dear Lady who can help ye
When married to grim Water Kelpie!!!
