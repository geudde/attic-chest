Once by the ocean’s shingly side  
&emsp;The fair Maria strayed;  
Her graceful form, with female pride,  
&emsp;In purple robe arrayed.  
  
2  
  
A bonnet on her head she bore,  
&emsp;With snow-white ribbands grac’d;  
On which a lucid veil she wore,  
&emsp;Depending to her waist  
  
3  
  
Thus as the heedless damsel strayed,  
&emsp;Pleased ocean stopt his roar;  
Th’amourous sylphs, the lovely maid,  
&emsp;Pursued along the shore.  
  
4  
  
And oft those sylphs would strive to gain,  
Enamoured of her grace —  
But still as oft they strove in vain,  
To view her lovely face.  
  
5  
  
And oft as shining shells to cull  
&emsp;She stopped upon the shore:  
Or wished the plants marine to pull  
&emsp;Her veil they upward bore.  
  
6  
  
But still her ready hand the veil,  
&emsp;In its right place supplied;  
The sylphs distrest so oft to fail,  
&emsp;With disappointment sighed.  
  
7  
  
To every wat’ry god they prayed —  
&emsp;The Tritons would not hear;  
And, jealous of the beauteous maid,  
&emsp;No sea nymph lent an ear  
  
8  
  
The syrens as they blew their shells  
&emsp;Were deaf to every prayer;  
The gods superior, in their cells,  
&emsp;Deemed such beneath their care.  
  
9  
  
At length arising from his cave,  
&emsp;Where gems supply the day;  
Far, far beneath the ocean wave —  
&emsp;A gnome now took his way.  
  
10  
  
Long had the sprite the damsel known,  
&emsp;And sought her for his bride;  
But still the maid as cold as stone,  
&emsp;His earnest suit denied.  
  
11  
  
Although in Henry’s shape he strove,  
&emsp;The nymph obdurate hears  
His vows of never-ending love;  
&emsp;Till wearied with his prayers,  
  
12  
  
At length she said, “Get thou this veil,  
&emsp;Which ne’er shall be untied;  
And then, (my promise shall not fail!)  
&emsp;I’ll be thy faithful bride.”  
  
13  
  
At this the gnome was sore dismayed,  
&emsp;From him all hopes did fly;  
For ne’er, unless the sylphs would aid,  
&emsp;Could he the knot untie.  
 
14  
  
And *Ever* Gnomes and sylphs between,  
&emsp;Since first their races rose;  
A dreadful enmity has been,  
&emsp;And they must still be foes,  
  
15  
  
And many a sylph the gnome besought,   
&emsp;But none would hear his prayer;  
And but for this, ’twas now he brought  
&emsp;His aid with speedy care.  
  
16  
  
He showed them where the ribbands white,  
&emsp;In mazy folds combined,  
By her fair hands, a curious sight,  
&emsp;Held fast the veil behind.  
  
17  
  
He showed two ends, the springs that hold  
&emsp;The various knots confined,  
That the white ribbands various fold,  
&emsp;So fast together bind.  
  
18  
  
And now each end three sylphs are pulling  
&emsp;With force on either side.  
Th’unheeding maid her shells is culling —  
&emsp;And now her veil’s untied —  
  
19  
  
The veils untied, and by her side  
&emsp;It fell; the sylphs amazed,  
Unheeding now of ought beside,  
&emsp;Upon her beauty gazed.  
  
20  
  
Admiring too, upon the shore,  
&emsp;The gnome one moment stood;  
Then high the fatal veil he bore,  
&emsp;And plunged amid the flood.  
  
21  
  
Close by the waves th’ astonished maid  
&emsp;Her eyes suffused with tears,  
Intent the sinking veil surveyed,  
&emsp;That filled her heart with fears.  
  
22  
  
The sylphids who the cause now guest,  
&emsp;Swift to redeem it flew;  
But ere they reached the spot, their quest  
&emsp;Was vanished from their view.  
  
23  
  
With drooping wings they back return,  
&emsp;And wail the nymph around;  
But scarce had they began to mourn,  
&emsp;An earthquake rocked the ground.  
  
24  
  
The affrighted maiden sought to fly  
&emsp;When lo, her feet before,  
An hideous chasm met her eye,  
&emsp;Full thirty feet and more.  
  
25  
  
And through the chasm the victor gnome,  
&emsp;With smile triumphant rose;  
To bear her to his secret home,  
&emsp;And in the Earth inclose.  
  
26  
  
Kneeling before him now appears,  
&emsp;The trembling weeping maid;  
He pitying viewed her streaming tears,  
&emsp;Then raised her up and said,  
  
27  
  
“A twelvemonth more behold the sun,  
&emsp;And taste the sweets of day;  
But when one year his course has run,  
&emsp;I bear thee hence away.”  
  
28  
  
“Till then forbade by mightier powers,  
&emsp;To bear thee to my cell;  
Or pass on Earth my tedious hours,  
&emsp;Within my cave I dwell.”  
  
29  
  
The ground swift closed upon the gnome —  
&emsp;The sorrowing nymph returned;  
Where she repentant, in her home,  
&emsp;Her promise vainly mourned.
