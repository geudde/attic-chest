<span class="title">Si le Roi m’avoit donné  </span>
  
Mere wealth & power bestowed on me,  
&emsp;E’en by King Henry’s hand;  
And I must bid adieu to thee  
&emsp;Must quit my native land.  
King Henry’s richest gifts I’d spurn,  
&emsp;For what is wealth to me?  
The monarch from my lips should learn,  
&emsp;That nought can equal thee.
