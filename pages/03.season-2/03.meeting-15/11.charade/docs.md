#### Charade

The name of a River and the Latin for Camp Make, the name of a Town in England

#### Riddle

There is a certain natural production, which is neither animal, vegetable, nor mineral, neither Male nor Female, but most frequently between both. — It has neither height, breadth, depth, nor thickness — It commonly exists from two to six feet above the surface of the ground. It is mentioned in the Old Testament and strongly recommended in the New; — and at the same time may be equally subservient to fidelity or treachery.
