In England’s fair and fertile plains  
Where liberty and plenty reigns  
&emsp;Full many a cherry grows  
With coat as dark as sable night  
And many a fragrant rose as white  
&emsp;As Winter’s unsunn’d swows.  
  
And eke in England’s Towns I ween,  
A comely Cat is frequent seen  
&emsp;Of *such* a cherry-dye  
Whose gloss gives lustre to her toes  
That, soft and velvet, with the rose  
&emsp;In snowy whiteness vie.  
  
Your riddle, Sapient Sir, behold  
With dextrous skill we soon unfold,  
&emsp;Yet such a cobweb jest.  
Some Son of Balaam’s long-eared race  
Alone we think, would dare to place.  
&emsp;Within the Sacred Chest.  
  
Go idler task thy nobler powers  
And give henceforth thy studious hours  
&emsp;To sense and song sublime  
Which in this Chest their favourite shrine  
Embalm’d by Phœbus and the Nine  
&emsp;May scorn the tooth of Time.
