#### Versified and Paraphrased from the German of Góethe  
  
&emsp;At early morn I climb’d the Steep,  
&emsp;That overhangs the Valley deep,  
And set intent the gloomy Fog to view;  
&emsp;Like a grey Canvass spread around,  
&emsp;That hid from Sight the fertile Ground,  
&emsp;And deaden’d ev’ry distant Sound,  
And gave to ev’ry Sense Sensations new.  
  
&emsp;Sudden appear’d a blooming Boy,  
&emsp;Whose dimpled Cheeks spoke infant Joy,  
His golden Locks around his Shoulders play’d;  
&emsp;His Presence struck me with Surprize,  
&emsp;But the soft Glances from his Eyes,  
&emsp;Proclaim’d him Cupid in Disguise,  
Who gently leaning o’er my Shoulder say’d,  
  
&emsp;“Why sit you idly gazing there,  
&emsp;Your Pencil blunt, the Canvass bare,  
Have you for Drawing lost your wonted Taste?  
&emsp;Have you for ever lost your Skill  
&emsp;To paint the clear pellucid Rill,  
&emsp;To show the boldly rising Hill,  
The Skies, the Woods, the Fields, or sandy Waste?”  
  
&emsp;Will that Child play the Master’s Part,  
&emsp;And teach me Painting’s pleasing Art,  
I whisper’d gazing on his blooming Face;  
&emsp;Will he my ready Pencil guide,  
&emsp;To sketch the rapid rolling Tide,  
&emsp;The Banks that form its Channel wide,  
Where sits th’ Entrapper of the finny race?  
  
&emsp;“To form the Landscape well I know,”  
&emsp;Reply’d the Boy, “When rob’d in Snow,  
Or deck’d in Nature’s gayest, brightest Dress;  
&emsp;The flying Pencil in my Hand  
&emsp;Soon shapes the Woods, the Streams, the Land,  
&emsp;Hills rise and sink at my Command,  
My varied Tints, the deep’ning Vales express.”  
  
&emsp;Then stretch’d he out his rosy Hand,  
&emsp;That spurn’d the formal School’s Command,  
With Finger Tip upon the Canvass drew  
&emsp;A Sun, that from the Empyrium play’d,  
&emsp;And gave the Trees a soften’d Shade,  
&emsp;And glittering golden Fringes made  
The airy Clouds that skimm’d th’ Ethereal blue.  
  
&emsp;The waving Wood he then portray’d,  
&emsp;And various Hue and various Shade,  
And misty Mountains in the Distance sketch’d;  
&emsp;That gently o’er each other rose,  
&emsp;Now high, now low, now far, now close,  
&emsp;Embrown’d with Heath or grey with Moss,  
And round th’ Horizon in long Chain they stretch’d.  
  
&emsp;Below there flow’d a crystal Stream,  
&emsp;That spark’d in the Sun’s bright Beam,  
And ’gainst the grassy borders seem’d to beat;  
&emsp;White flow’rs mix the Waves among,  
&emsp;With Tendons ever fresh and long,  
&emsp;Not carried by the Tide along,  
But fix’d and blooming ever gay and meet.  
  
&emsp;The Bullrush grac’d the River’s shore,  
&emsp;With Flow’rs the Meads were sprinkl’d o’er,  
With Cowslips, Daisies, and sweet Violets blew;  
&emsp;The feather’s Songsters from the Wood,  
&emsp;The wild Teal swimming in the Flood,  
&emsp;Seem’d to adorn their Maker good,  
Who pour’d his Blessings ever great and new.  
  
&emsp;Then Heaven’s blue Expanse he form’d,  
&emsp;With airy Clouds so well adorn’d,  
They seem’d the Work of Nature’s skilful Hand;  
&emsp;No rising Storm did they foretell,  
&emsp;To drench with Rain the daisied Dell;  
&emsp;Or drive the Coney to her Cell,  
But gently floated o’er the smiling Land.  
  
&emsp;Lost in an extacy of Joy,  
&emsp;I now beheld the Painter Boy,  
And now the Painting with enraptur’d Gaze;  
&emsp;“Have I not prov’d,” exclaimed the Child,  
&emsp;“That I can paing the Woodland wild,  
&emsp;Or draw the Heavens serene and mild,  
Or form the Shadows of the Sun’s bright Blaze?”  
  
&emsp;“And yet I’ve not shewn half my Art,  
&emsp;The Paintings but complete in Part,  
The Test of Skill as yet remains untried;”  
&emsp;Then were the Wood its Branches wav’d,  
&emsp;And cast around a pleasing Shade,  
&emsp;And shelter’d ev’ry grassy Glade,  
And darken’d half the rolling River’s Tide,  
  
&emsp;There with his skillful Hand, he forms  
&emsp;A Maiden, bright in Youthful Charms,  
So lovely she to Venus might compare;  
&emsp;Her modest Look, her sparkling Eyes,  
&emsp;Her well-turn’d Shape, her simple Guise,  
&emsp;Struck me with Wonder and Surprize,  
And o’er her Bosom fell her Auburn hair.  
  
&emsp;Her blushing Cheeks outvied the Rose,  
&emsp;That in the shady Valley grows,  
She seem’d a Goddess from the Olympic Hill.  
&emsp;Say Boy, I cried, what Master’s Hand  
&emsp;Gives thee of Nature such Command,  
&emsp;That thus so soft, so sweet, so grand,  
You form your Picture with unequall’d Skill.  
  
&emsp;Lo! as I spoke, a gentle breeze  
&emsp;Shakes in the wood the ancient Trees,  
And softly agitates their spreading boughs;  
&emsp;And now the Maiden’s silken Veil  
&emsp;Sports in the idle whispering Gale,  
&emsp;That took it for a Galley’s Sail,  
That through the liquid Waves a Passage ploughs.  
  
&emsp;The Maid herself now moves along,  
&emsp;Responsive to the Bird’s wild Song,  
Approach’d me sitting with the charming Boy;  
&emsp;Her measur’d Steps are drawing near,  
&emsp;The Fog around began to clear,  
&emsp;Dismiss’d is ev’ry idle Fear;  
I felt elate with more than mortal Joy.  
  
&emsp;Now that all Nature seem’d alive,  
&emsp;And while with new-born Pleasure strive,  
The Maiden tripping o’er the flow’ry Plain;  
&emsp;Her floating Veil, the Flowers, the Wood,  
&emsp;The River’s rapid rolling Flood,  
&emsp;Think you I, now in gloomy Mood,  
Like Rock itself upon the Rock remain.
