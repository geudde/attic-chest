&emsp;At early morn I climb’d the steep,  
&emsp;That overhangs the valley deep,  
And set intent the gloomy fog to view;  
&emsp;Like a grey canvas spread around,  
&emsp;That hid from sight the fertile ground,  
&emsp;And deaden’d ev’ry distant sound,  
And gave to ev’ry sense sensations new.  
  
&emsp;Sudden appear’d a blooming boy,  
&emsp;Whose dimpled cheeks spoke infant joy,  
His golden locks around his shoulders play’d;  
&emsp;His presence struck me with surprise,  
&emsp;But the soft glances from his eyes,  
&emsp;Proclaim’d him Cupid in disguise,  
Who gently leaning o’er my shoulder say’d,  
  
&emsp;“Why sit you idly gazing there,  
&emsp;Your pencil blunt, the canvas bare,  
Have you for drawing lost your wonted taste?  
&emsp;Have you for ever lost your skill  
&emsp;To paint the clear pellucid rill,  
&emsp;To show the boldly rising hill,  
The skies, the woods, the fields, or sandy waste?”  
  
&emsp;Will that child play the master’s part,  
&emsp;And teach me painting’s pleasing art,  
I whisper’d gazing on his blooming face;  
&emsp;Will he my ready pencil guide,  
&emsp;To sketch the rapid rolling tide,  
&emsp;The banks that form its channel wide,  
Where sits th’ Entrapper of the finny race?  
  
&emsp;“To form the landscape well I know,”  
&emsp;Reply’d the boy, “When rob’d in snow,  
Or deck’d in nature’s gayest, brightest dress;  
&emsp;The flying pencil in my hand  
&emsp;Soon shapes the woods, the streams, the land,  
&emsp;Hills rise and sink at my command,  
My varied tints, the deep’ning vales express.”  
  
&emsp;Then stretch’d he out his rosy hand,  
&emsp;That spurn’d the formal school’s command,  
With finger tip upon the canvas drew  
&emsp;A sun, that from the Empyrium play’d,  
&emsp;And gave the trees a soften’d shade,  
&emsp;And glittering golden fringes made  
The airy clouds that skimm’d th’ ethereal blue.  
  
&emsp;The waving wood he then portray’d,  
&emsp;And various hue and various shade,  
And misty mountains in the distance sketch’d;  
&emsp;That gently o’er each other rose,  
&emsp;Now high, now low, now far, now close,  
&emsp;Embrown’d with heath or grey with moss,  
And round th’ horizon in long chain they stretch’d.  
  
&emsp;Below there flow’d a crystal stream,  
&emsp;That spark’d in the sun’s bright beam,  
And ’gainst the grassy borders seem’d to beat;  
&emsp;White flow’rs mix the waves among,  
&emsp;With tendons ever fresh and long,  
&emsp;Not carried by the tide along,  
But fix’d and blooming ever gay and meet.  
  
&emsp;The bullrush grac’d the river’s shore,  
&emsp;With flow’rs the meads were sprinkl’d o’er,  
With cowslips, daisies, and sweet violets blew;  
&emsp;The feather’s songsters from the wood,  
&emsp;The wild teal swimming in the flood,  
&emsp;Seem’d to adorn their maker good,  
Who pour’d his blessings ever great and new.  
  
&emsp;Then heaven’s blue expanse he form’d,  
&emsp;With airy clouds so well adorn’d,  
They seem’d the work of nature’s skilful hand;  
&emsp;No rising storm did they foretell,  
&emsp;To drench with rain the daisied dell;  
&emsp;Or drive the coney to her cell,  
But gently floated o’er the smiling land.  
  
&emsp;Lost in an ecstasy of joy,  
&emsp;I now beheld the painter boy,  
And now the painting with enraptur’d gaze;  
&emsp;“Have I not prov’d,” exclaimed the child,  
&emsp;“That I can paint the woodland wild,  
&emsp;Or draw the heavens serene and mild,  
Or form the shadows of the sun’s bright blaze?”  
  
&emsp;“And yet I’ve not shewn half my art,  
&emsp;The paintings but complete in part,  
The test of skill as yet remains untried;”  
&emsp;Then were the wood its branches wav’d,  
&emsp;And cast around a pleasing shade,  
&emsp;And shelter’d ev’ry grassy glade,  
And darken’d half the rolling river’s tide,  
  
&emsp;There with his skillful hand, he forms  
&emsp;A maiden, bright in youthful charms,  
So lovely she to Venus might compare;  
&emsp;Her modest look, her sparkling eyes,  
&emsp;Her well-turn’d shape, her simple guise,  
&emsp;Struck me with wonder and surprise,  
And o’er her bosom fell her auburn hair.  
  
&emsp;Her blushing cheeks outvied the rose,  
&emsp;That in the shady valley grows,  
She seem’d a goddess from the Olympic hill.  
&emsp;Say boy, I cried, what master’s hand  
&emsp;Gives thee of nature such command,  
&emsp;That thus so soft, so sweet, so grand,  
You form your picture with unequall’d skill.  
  
&emsp;Lo! as I spoke, a gentle breeze  
&emsp;Shakes in the wood the ancient trees,  
And softly agitates their spreading boughs;  
&emsp;And now the maiden’s silken veil  
&emsp;Sports in the idle whispering gale,  
&emsp;That took it for a galley’s sail,  
That through the liquid waves a passage ploughs.  
  
&emsp;The maid herself now moves along,  
&emsp;Responsive to the bird’s wild song,  
Approach’d me sitting with the charming boy;  
&emsp;Her measur’d steps are drawing near,  
&emsp;The fog around began to clear,  
&emsp;Dismiss’d is ev’ry idle fear;  
I felt elate with more than mortal joy.  
  
&emsp;Now that all nature seem’d alive,  
&emsp;And while with new-born pleasure strive,  
The maiden tripping o’er the flow’ry plain;  
&emsp;Her floating veil, the flowers, the wood,  
&emsp;The river’s rapid rolling flood,  
&emsp;Think you I, now in gloomy mood,  
Like rock itself upon the rock remain.
