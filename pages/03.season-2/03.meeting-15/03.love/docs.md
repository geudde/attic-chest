Love! thou pleasing, gen’rous feeling,  
&emsp;In what shape art thou not found?  
Gently o’er the senses stealing,  
&emsp;In a soft delirium drown’d!  
  
“Lo! with martial stride appearing,  
&emsp;Deck’d in soldiers’ trim array,  
Thou! nor wounds nor carnage fearing,  
&emsp;Lead’st to hasty rout the way!”  
  
“Now as hermit prostrate falling,  
&emsp;Scrip and beads around thee strung,  
Thou a joyous huntsman calling,  
&emsp;Horn and belt on shoulder strung.”  
  
Wild, to antic measure dancing,  
&emsp;Now the mantling cup goes round,  
Fauns and satyrs round thee prancing,  
&emsp;Lightly o’er the mystic ground:  
 
Quick, with looks demure yet smiling,  
&emsp;See the shepherd youth appears,  
With sweet note the nymph beguiling,  
&emsp;Softly woo’d with vows and tears!  
  
Sighs, entreaties, wiles enchanting,  
&emsp;Ever ready at thy nod,  
Kneeling, trembling, struggling, panting,  
&emsp;Still prepar’d, thou busy god!  
  
Yet with ev’ry little failing,  
&emsp;Thou art welcome still to me,  
Gone — my heart is ever wailing,  
&emsp;Life’s but savage liberty.
