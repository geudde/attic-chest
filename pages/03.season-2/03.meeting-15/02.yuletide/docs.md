Address’d to Miss Porden in acknowledgement of the pleasure the Author received this <span data-tippy="January 2d. 1810" class="green">this Evening</span>Evening.
  
As icy gales from northern regions blow,  
And the hodge holly peeps beneath the snow,  
The clouds disperse — fair Cynthia’s welcome ray  
Directs my homeward, cheers my lonely way;  
More bright the beam — a Form celestial seen,  
Descending lightly o’er the frozen green  
A Fairy Form, who seems to seek for rest  
Upon the Rosetree, now by Winter drest  
Whose berries oft the hungry Redbreast fee  
Amaz’d! I stand unable to proceed.  
Her wand majestic waving seems to say  
“To this fair vision, Man and attention pay  
I from high Jove for Winter’s pastime sent,  
My pow’r awhile to earthly Mortals lent.  
Seest thou yon splendid mansion’s stately gate  
*Benevolence* and *Friendship* there await  
With *Hospitality* to give the treat.  
My entrance be the signal Mortal come  
Yuletide invites you to the festive dome  
No cold reception of a stranger fear,  
To *ev’ry* Guest, Politeness lends an ear.  
*Good humour*, *Genius*, *Harmony* combine  
TO tinge *their* pleasures with a “*ray* divine”.  
On *that* descended, *here* I willing rest  
The throne I claim, fair Ellen’s “Attic Chest.””
