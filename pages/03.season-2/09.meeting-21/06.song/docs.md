If ever prayer of hapless love  
Might gentle hours your pity move  
Now urge your flight with speediest wing  
And to these arms my Delia bring  
Dear maid! what charm like her can cheer  
&emsp;When fortune frowns, the sinking soul!  
Her smile unfurls the brow of care,  
&emsp;And sickness owns her song’s control.  

Long, long my fond impatient heart  
Hath felt suspense’s restless smart!  
How slowly mov’d the prince of day!  
Yon moon — how tedious her delay!  
O Cynthia! down the azure fly,  
&emsp;And bid thy brother shine again,  
And tell him, ere he quits the sky  
&emsp;To make my wish no longer vain.    
  
Ah why should fortune’s wayward hate  
Thy truest votary’s Love await  
And why should all her torments be  
Reserv’d for one who loves like me  
Nor rest nor peace my bosom knows  
&emsp;Save when perchance some irksome night  
If sleep my wearied eye-lids close  
&emsp;My soul to Delia takes its flight  
  
O lend ye hours, a favouring ear!  
That hour that brings my charmer here;  
That happy hour, my grateful rhyme  
Shall rescue from the stream of time  
The sprightly notes that tell my joy  
&emsp;For ever give “that hour” to fame;  
For never can its meaning die  
&emsp;When join’d in song with Delia’s name.
