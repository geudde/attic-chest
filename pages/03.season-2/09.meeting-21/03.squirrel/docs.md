A pris’ner to the gilded cage,  
&emsp;For no offence confin’d;  
Poor squirrel, shall tonight engage,  
&emsp;The Muse of pity’s mind.  
  
Who would thy little hardships tell,  
&emsp;A fav’rite’s woes bewail;  
Lament thy warm nest, mossy cell  
&emsp;And forester’s regale!  
 
No beechwood to allure thy flight,  
&emsp;Or oak, or mastick tree  
Look to the poplars tow’ring height;  
&emsp;Pine buds or liberty.  

No hoarded cone or winter’s store,  
&emsp;Poor animal for thee!  
Or shining acorns, tempt thee more,  
&emsp;In hollow cavity.  
  
Remov’d from all by nature dear,  
&emsp;Thy woods thy furry tribe;  
What shall confinement now endear;  
&emsp;Or soft affection bribe?  
  
Dost thou around the brassy wires,  
&emsp;Some daily passport seek;  
What heart shall feel thy just desires  
&emsp;Or hand the bondage break?  
  
Yes — oft thy plaints are understood,  
&emsp;Whene’er Maria near,  
Cheers thy captivity with food;  
&emsp;And checks each causeless fear.  

Can childhood’s tender care repay  
&emsp;Thy native freedom lost;  
Tho’ soft thy bed of freshest hay,  
&emsp;With milk thy viands moist.  
  
With nuts and chestnuts still supplied,  
&emsp;Can’st thou a while forget;  
The rural pleasures here denied,  
No more the woods regret?  
  
Then mayst thou happy pris’ner be,  
&emsp;No cruel torments fear,  
With open’d door once more thou’st free  
&emsp;To play thy gambols here.  
  
Thy mistress early taught to know,  
&emsp;That even Insects feel!  
By kindness shall those cares bestow,  
&emsp;That may thy sorrows heal.  
  
On her protection then repose,  
&emsp;And all thy troubles end:  
Upon her bosom softly doze —  
&emsp;The bosom of a Friend!  

Fidelia
