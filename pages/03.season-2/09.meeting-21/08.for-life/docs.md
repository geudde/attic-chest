<span class="title">From the Greek of Metrodorus  </span>
  
Mankind may rove, unvex’d by strife,  
Thro’ ev’ry road of human life.  
Fair wisdom regulates the Bar,  
And peace concludes the wordy war.  
At home auspicious mortals find  
Serene tranquillity of mind,  
All beauteous nature decks the plain,  
And merchants plough for gold the main.  
Respect, arises from our store,  
Security, from being poor:  
More joys the bands of hymen give,  
Th’unmarried in more freedom live:  
If parents, our bless’d lot we own  
Childless, we have no cause to moan  
Firm vigour crowns our youthful stage  
And venerable hairs old-age.  
Since all is good, then who would cry,  
“I’d never live, or quickly die!”
