<div class="author">Miss Flaxman</div>

> To any Knight of the Attic Chest  
who may have courage enough to take up the Gauntlet!  
  
A Boon! a Boon! the Lady cries  
Name it, fair Dame, the Knight replies  
’Tis but to speak your sov’reign will,  
Must I some caitiff giant kill?  
Or Dragon fierce shall I attack?  
Say, and I’ll do it in a crack.  
No gentle Knight, I’m not so cruel  
To send your Worship to such duel,  
’Tis not to prance in warlike field  
With Lance and Buckler, Sword and Shield,  
But merely on a sheet of paper  
With Ink so black, and Pen so taper,  
A brace or two of lines to write,  
Such as *your* Muse knows well t’indite;  
And for a *Subject*, if she halts  
Take this, a fruitful one, the *Ladies’ faults!*  
  
Thalestris
