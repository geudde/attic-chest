Wherefore does Lycidas renounce the Song?  
That song, the list’ning Maidens joy’d to hear  
Why is that Lyre neglected and unstrung?  
<span data-tippy="Which" class="green">That</span> used to charm with witching noted the ear!  
  
Has Life no joys for Lycidas to sing?  
O let not Care thus play the Tyrant’s part  
But strike again the soft harmonious string  
Again lead captive ev’ry female heart!  
  
Again for Lycidas some Nymph shall twine  
The lasting Myrtle, with the crown of Bays  
And Ah dear Lycidas the task be mine!  
To weave the garland that rewards thy Lays!
