> On her presenting me with a beautiful copy of the Pleasures of Memory  
  
Yes dearest maid, to thee I owe  
&emsp;This sweet companion of my leisure,  
To me its numbers ever flow,  
&emsp;A pensive source of mental pleasure  
  
Mayst thou fair maid be ever blest,  
&emsp;In mem’ry’s sweetest, choicest measures,  
(In this is every wish exprest,  
&emsp;For this includes all other pleasures.)  
  
Thrice happy those whose mental eyes,  
&emsp;Behold her mirror, pure, transparent,  
Without one lurking stain of vice  
&emsp;Upon its polished face apparent.  
  
Oh mayst thou e’er in such a mirror find  
Thy perfect form the image of thy mind.  
  
Mnemosyneia
