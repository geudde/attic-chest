Lady, the arrow tho’ aim’d ne’er so well  
Directed “to his Heart” enslav’d before  
Must doubtless in its wily errand fail  
For Love has enter’d and secur’d the door,  
Here in this circle, sits the chosen Fair  
Seeming unconscious of her sov’reign pow’r  
She, will my humble Dulce Domum share  
For her alone I’ll deck the nuptial bow’r.

The Fort that stands on Dover’s height  
Is hidden by the shades of *night*,  
So is the Cot below,  
And seven days must twice be told  
E’re we again the Chest behold  
Of Genius *Mischief* — the dépôt.
