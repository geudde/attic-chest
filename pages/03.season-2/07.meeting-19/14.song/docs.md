#### A new Song to be sung to the old tune of “Four and twenty Fiddlers,” &c.  
  
Four and twenty authors all of a row  
Four and twenty authors all of a row,  
With an epic, dramatic, iambic, dithrambic — and an alexandrine.  
Rumbling like an old mill-stone so neat & *fine*,  
Up four pair of stairs in Grub Street, backward.  
Mounting by half dozens at a time on poor Pegasus  
Tho’ he was foot spavin’d and bone spavin’d, all over dirt  
Slip shoulder’d, and jaded to *death*.  
Calling to each other till quite out of *breath*  
That there was room enough for *all*,  
Till some were so squeez’d that they loudly did *bawl*  
By Jupiter the moon-snuffer!  
If the rest did not get off directly  
They’d beat them all, down below,  
This is my lady’s holiday, therefore we’ll be merry.  
    
2nd  
  
Four and twenty printers all of a row  
Four and twenty &c.  
With spankem, and hampem, zounds! you’ve made a hole through the paper!  
Oil and ink, black and stink,  
Two devils and a compositor placing great it  
Where & should be, down below, with an epic,  
Dramatic &c &c.  
  
3rd  
  
Four and twenty booksellers all of a row,  
Four &c  
With a “Fine wove paper, broad margin, and double hot-press’d  
New type cast on purpose by Mr Caslon,  
Cast by Mr Caslon! why he has been dead for years!  
That don’t signify, Sir, we always give the best  
Names to what we sell whether the people be dead  
Or alive! The book used to sell for two pence half-penny  
The price is now half a guinea!  
Everything is so dear, and times are so hard!  
With an iambic, dithrambic, &c.”  
    
4th  
  
Four and twenty readers all of a row!  
Four and twenty &c.  
“Pray Miss, have you seen Deputy Allsop’s Sonnets to Lady Louisa Lollypop? they are the sweetest things in the world!”  
“Pray Madam, do you like Odyssey Pope or Shakespear best?”  
“Ma’am, Valerius Martialis for me,  
Dear Madam, you should not carry too much Valerian about, it will make the cats follow you!”  
For my part, I can hear nothing but dear, delightful elegant sentiment, that makes me faint at the sight of a Tom Tit, and die at the hopping of a flea!”  
Psha, Psha, Ladies, that’s all trash, as Professor Diddle (of the Royal Institution) says, on the authority of Baron Humbug! — you should read nothing, but, analytical, algebraic, botanical, chemical, metaphysical, polyglot encyclopedias of cookery in nine and twenty Oriental languages! With mica, quartz, feld-spars and electric *fluid*  
To set all your wits alight!  
And make you wiser than a *druid*!  
With a bantum & a leantum, down below  
This is my lady’s holiday, therefore —  
— we will be merry.
