What eager crowds to greet thy glad return  
&emsp;Within the temple’s sacred precincts throng;  
&emsp;Each face looks glad, and ev’ry grateful tongue  
Declares the joys which in each bosom burn:  
Thou com’st — at once the church is hush’d and still,  
&emsp;Nought but thy firm, and deep ton’d voice is heard,  
&emsp;Teaching mild Christian Love — its ev’ry word  
To reason’s guidance bends the stubborn will  
And draws the veil from pleasure’s dangerous snare.  
&emsp;Conviction spreads a general light — all feel  
&emsp;A holy flame, a pure religious zeal,  
And all, with one accord, pour forth a prayer,  
&emsp;A righteous prayer, and glowing from the heart  
&emsp;That they and thou, good man, no more may part.
