<div class="author">Miss Flaxman</div>

From us my Laura it is said  
The laughing loves away are fled,  
The rose of youth its leaves have shed  
And left alone the thorn.  
Mistaken friends, it is not so,  
The wanton loves indeed may go,  
The rose of youth may cease to glow,  
But yet we’re not forlorn,  
  
For sure in hearts so warm as ours  
Affection’s sweetest, fairest flow’rs  
Will bloom to cheer our wintry hours  
And never, know decay,  
Besides, my dearest friend will own  
The little loves are not *all* flown,  
That one remains that’s all our own  
And he will *never* stray.  
  
The loves that *flew*, were wanton, wild,  
But *this* is tractable and mild,  
Of tend’rest *friendship*, he’s the child  
And *this* sweet child is ours.  
Then while each fond, each faithful breast,  
Shall harbour such a gentle guest,  
Still, still, my Laura we are blest  
Our path *still* graced with flowers.
