&emsp;Hoppner whilst I to cheat the villain time  
With daring hand thy matchless feats portray  
&emsp;A painter now and now a man of rhyme  
As suits the humour of the changeful day  
&emsp;Think not thy breath can chase the clouds away  
That veil my sapient phiz from vulgar eyes  
&emsp;Nor let suspicion on thy giblets prey  
That malice lurks beneath the quaint disguise  
&emsp;For know my friend tho’ gentle frisky tries  
To plague thy pate he plays a harmless game  
&emsp;And not a wight beneath the golden skies  
More dearly hold thy person and thy fame  
&emsp;Or longs to see thee more (thy purse well lin’d)  
Marching with duck-like grace a fair round paunch behind.
