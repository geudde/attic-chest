No bard has liv’d since Homer’s days  
Without a song in Cupid’s praise,  
But never yet could bard or sage  
Agree about his equipage —   
He rides a dove, in heathen story  
In Hindostan, a prating lory:  
In Mexico a fox — and here,  
An animal with length of *ear*.  
Whate’er his equipage may be  
His sting and venom all can see:  
All know the symptoms of the fever  
But none the patient can deliver.  
A Tuscan, learn’d as Magliabechi,  
Can with an apt example deck me:  
The truant once forgot his duty  
And left his book to gaze on beauty.  
Pangs he had never felt before  
Flew from his caput to his core:  
He look’d o’er Boerhaave, mus’d on Galen,  
Thought old Hippocrates unfailing;  
Compar’d his case, and hop’d to prove it  
A tertian ague, or a love fit.  
  
Physicians! where shall mortals seek  
A recipe for love in Greek?  
One sage prescribes a hemlock salad  
Another bids us write a ballad:  
Leander swam o’er Hellespont  
Or cool’d his flame by *thinking on’t* —   
But Venus is old Ocean’s daughter  
And love is seldom drown’d in water  
Whence modern wits and bards opine  
The elf is soonest drown’d in wine.  
Our student mus’d with aching head  
Then call’d his page and gravely said  
“My faithful Marco, ’tis most fit  
From beauty’s spells, to guard my *wit*  
For all men know, tho’ some disguise it,  
The less we have, the more we prize it.  
Peripatetic sages say  
A man in love should *walk away*;  
But modern commentators think  
They mean that he should *walk to drink*;  
Both text and comment may be right —   
I’ll try the recipe tonight:  
But Marco! where the wine is best  
Write on the tavern portal — *Est!*”  
  
The page rode off — the heartburnt swain  
Sighed as he look’d — and look’d again  
Where frozen spires and columns rise  
And Alpine ice-rocks pierce the skies.  
“Ah! thus — ” the wailing lover cried,  
“Thus beauty spreads her frozen pride;  
As vainly and as coldly bright  
As spangled spar of chrysolite.  
The sun unheeded looks between  
Those icy hills’ eternal screen;  
Like maiden pride, in cold repose,  
They smile, but melt not when he glows.  
The wretch who trusts that vestal snow  
Shall find a joyless grave below,  
A grave unpitied and unblest —   
No matter now — I see an *Est.*”  
  
The wine was old, the waiters spruce  
It seem’d the true Falernian juice;  
But wits and lovers have a notion  
That wisdom is perpetual motion.  
Again he walks — but by his side  
He sees a beauteous phantom glide;  
The moonbeams sparkle like the glance  
Of blue-eyed Laura in the dance:  
“And must I lose,” the lover cries  
“That beaming glance, those sapphire eyes?  
No; wherefore should I go beyond  
This willow, or this standing pond?  
A cool transparent tomb is best —   
Not yet‚ I see another *Est!*”  
  
No tavern on the Alpine way  
Boasts purer sherry or jomay —   
Our lover tastes and find it fit,  
But who knows *quantum sufficit?*  
He thinks again of Laura’s smile  
And strives to walk another mile.  
“Relentless nymph! Thy tyrant reign  
Consumes my heart and wastes my brain,  
My sight grows dim, a hollow sound  
Floats in mysterious murmurs round  
Come Death! Thy leaden hand shall spread  
Soft poppies o’er a lover’s head:  
I faint, I fall, I breathe no more —   
What, are no waiters at the door?  
This tavern well deserves a guest —   
I see a treble *EST EST EST”*  
  
They come; with bowls of purple balm  
This deathful agony to calm;  
Again he lifts his closing eyes,  
And sighs and sips, and sips and sighs:  
But he who walks and sips too fast  
Must fall (asleep or dead) at least.  
Our hero strove as heroes should,  
And stood erect — or thought he stood;  
But fell — let all the Muses weep,  
And, shame to Cupid! — fell asleep.  
He slept — Childe Harold cannot tell  
How soon he woke, or where he fell:  
But maidens say his spirit glides  
By Montefiesco’s cellar-sides,  
Whene’er with broad and foaming flask  
The vintner seeks his oldest cask.  
Not seldom on Abydos’ coast  
He stalks with Selim’s headless ghost,  
Or oft, mistaken for a crow,  
Sits on that wondrous stone below.  
Which would not in the churchyard stay  
But chose, like him, to walk away,  
While on his grave this attic rhyme  
Tells modern swains his fate sublime  
“My walk was long — my love was dry,  
The wine was strong — and here am I!”
