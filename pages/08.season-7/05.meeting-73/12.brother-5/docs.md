<div class="author">Miss Vardill</div>
  
A dome stands on yon grassy steep,  
Where west-winds sigh o’er Ocean’s sleep;  
No guest invades its threshold green,  
No sun beam in its hall is seen:  
There dwells a pale and palsied man,  
Whose brow the stranger fears to scan.  
When midnight veils the silent hour  
He lingers in his lonely bow’r,  
And only when the stars are few,  
His wand’ring steps disturb the dew.  
		  
If ye have felt the sullen haze  
Which wraps the sun’s far-distant rays,  
Those rays so coldly, dimly seen    
Behind November’s frozen screen,  
Ye well may guess the damp control  
Of silent Bertram’s shrouded soul;  
Remote from touch yet ever nigh,  
It chill’d the heart, but mock’d the eye,  
As mists the captive spirit chain  
With slow, but unresisted reign.  
  
But friendship once, when life was new,  
Gave Bertram’s soul a brighter hue.  
His mood was fierce, his fancy wild,  
Yet sunk to peace if Edwin smil’d;  
He lov’d the race if Edwin ran  
His mirth with Edwin’s joy began:  
How softly thro’ yon crevic’d rock   
The well-remember’d streams distill!  
How sweetly to his slumb’ring flock  
Yon shepherd carols from the hill!  
That hoary hind was blithe and young  
When last the forest-lay he sung  
To soothe his jocund master’s ear  
While hound and huntsman slumber’d near.  
But that forgotten master now  
Has wrinkles on his silver’d brow,  
And never more shall Fancy greet  
His pillow with a dream so sweet  
As when upon that rock reclined  
He slumber’d in the summer-wind!   
  
Yet there remains a secret prize  
Remains his wither’d heart to bless,  
A treasure hid from vulgar eyes  
Deep in yon lonely dell’s recess.  
Long-buried Edwin’s orphan-child  
Grows shelter’d in the woodland wild —   
And see! — the fost’ring cottage still  
Peeps far below the tufted hill —   
Its casement glimmers thro’ the trees —   
He scents the woodbine in the breeze  
Which round its milk-white porch he twin’d  
Ere hope of peace he left behind.  
O haste! — the tardy gate unbar —   
A gentle guardian comes from far!  
Alas! — no cherub’s smile is near  
His worn and wasted heart to cheer:  
A thief has found the precious flow’r  
And torn it from its native bow’r!   
  
&ensp;&#42;&ensp;&#42;&ensp;&#42;  
  
What now avails the golden hoard  
By fortune’s lavish bounty pour’d  
On him, whom none remain to bless  
In life’s long wintry wilderness!  
The wretch who digs this thankless soil,  
Has yet a hope to soothe his toil,  
Some babe his parting kiss to crave  
Some pious hand to deck his grave,  
But not one kindred tear shall fall  
To gem his lonely master’s pall!  
  
Why, vassal, with such lavish care  
The desolated dome adorn?  
Ah! — rather leave his image there  
A mouldering ruin, cold and bare,  
With nightshade and the barren thorn!  
Why by these vagrant roses’ pride  
The dark funereal cypress hide?  
Thy lord has lost the latest rose  
Which bloom’d to grace his wintry close!  
  
Fond witless slaves! — with envious eyes  
Ye gaze and wonder at his sighs —   
Ye guess not with how weak a voice  
Pomp bids the ruined heart rejoice  
Of him who withering to the core  
Can hope, and trust, and love no more:  
Condemn’d to live till life is cold,  
While sapless hope itself grows old,  
Till frozen into lethargy  
The sleeping soul begins to die,  
And death, the body’s welcome doom,  
Scarce gives a deeper — darker tomb!  
  
&ensp;&#42;&ensp;&#42;&ensp;&#42;
  
At lonely Bertram’s silent gates  
A wan and whitehair’d minstrel waits  
With mountain-staff, and mantle green  
Slung o’er a moaning mandoline;  
Behind him smiles an urchin fair  
Whose rosy hands the harp prepare.  
“Lord Bertram! in they bounteous hall  
We mountain-minstrels wait thy call  
Now let soft melody’s control  
In brief oblivion lap thy soul.”  
It comes! thro’ moss-grown arches round  
Swells the lone harp’s soul-stealing sound  
Of youth and joy the minstrel sings  
And light as love’s ambrosial wings  
His fingers sweep the warbling strings.  
Such sounds from lutes ethereal creep  
When angels minister to sleep.  
He sings! — a list’ning cherub near  
Might pause that kindred voice to hear.  
  
Ere yet that heav’n-taught sound departs  
Sad Bertram from his pillow starts —   
Wrapp’d in a minstrel’s russet weeds  
The gentle songster’s form recedes;  
But from his brow, serene and bold,  
He parts his locks of clust’ring gold:  
Such blushes tinge his downy cheek  
As morning’s milkwhite vapour streak;  
While brightly gleam his azure eyes  
Like Cupid’s hid in mortal guise.  
“Fair boy! — thy mellow warblings seem  
The whispers of a holy dream —   
But whence art thou whose magic hand  
Pours on my ear this solace bland?”  
“Chaldea’s lonely wilds among  
I learn’d my sad and simple song:  
Once as on Mosul’s silent bank  
To slumber in its cave I sank  
Methought the swelling sand beneath,  
A plaintive minstrel seem’d to breathe  
‘Tread softly! — ’midst this barren sand  
Lie relics of a bounteous hand!  
Revere this dust! — it once was part  
Of buried Edwin’s trusting heart:  
If yet with vital warmth it glow’d,  
On thee its bounty would have flow’d!’  
So spoke my dream: — by morning’s light  
This ruby circlet met my sight,  
Rich with his symbol and his name —   
Will Bertram’s hand the relic claim?”  
  
Red glows the fire in Bertram’s eye —   
“Away! — ’tis false — he did not die —   
Could Mosul’s turban’d ruffians dare  
To touch the head they vow’d to spare? —   
They vow’d — or I had never left  
Lost Edwin in their cavern’s cleft —   
O no! — he died not; — ever here  
He sits my lonely pillow near  
And smiles, as once when life was young,  
He smil’d when to the race he sprung.  
Hence, mountain bandit! — hence and learn  
What fires round scorpion-conscience burn!  
Yet thou has tears — I feel them now  
Drop balmy on my burning brow —   
Kind stranger! — keep that precious tear  
To hallow my forsaken bier!  
As bounteous eyes on thee shall shine  
A tear as precious drop on thine.”  
  
Lost Edwin’s ransom’d hand receive,  
This voice, these eyes — this heart believe!  
Fate yields me yet one germ of joy,  
Our lov’d one’s pledge — this beauteous boy:  
A father found the cherish’d flow’r  
And led him to thy lonely bow’r.  

“Live, Bertram! — to thy contrite breast  
The pleading orphan once was prest;  
I give thee back thy gracious tears  
Thy pity gave his infant years:  
When all the gems of life depart  
That boon shall sparkle next thy heart.”  
  
&ensp;&#42;&ensp;&#42;&ensp;&#42;
  
Still Bertram lives, if life it is  
To brood on wreck’d and wasted bliss  
When ev’ry breathing is a sigh  
And ev’ry thought is agony.  
Fed on the deepest root of woe,  
The shame of a forgiven foe!
