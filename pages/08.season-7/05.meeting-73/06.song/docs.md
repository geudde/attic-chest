> Paraphrased  
  
Thy gaze and thy approach I shun,  
&emsp;Tho’ gladden’d in thy sight,  
As lilies droop before the sun  
&emsp;Yet live upon his light.  
  
The nightingale in Sharon’s bow’r  
&emsp;Is silent when he glows,  
Tho’ to his life-diffusing pow’r  
&emsp;Her summer-song she owes:  
  
The palm, Samaria’s purple pride,  
&emsp;Unfolds its nectar’d fruit,  
But deep in darkness strives to hide  
&emsp;The tendrils of its root:  
  
Thus maiden Beauty shuns the gaze  
&emsp;Which all its triumph brings;  
Thus Love its glowing tribute pays  
&emsp;But shews not whence it springs.
