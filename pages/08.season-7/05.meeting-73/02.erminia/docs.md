> Translated from a Hebrew Valentine  
> Address’d to Mr J----- otherwise S.P.T  
  
No flower in Covent Garden glows  
More gay than thee, thou first of beaux!  
When in thy coat, so furr’d and long,  
Thou joinst the fashionable throng  
The very mud of Bond Street stones  
Clings to thy skirts, attraction owns;  
While from thy well mustachio’d lip  
The London flies delighted sip  
The fragrant oil macassar there,  
And fancy ’tis some sweet parterre.  
  
Erminia  
  
Be pleased to observe dear Editress, that some verses bearing date March 10th sent to Sir P.T. are not from the Hebrew, but were intended for another gentleman of P--- House.
