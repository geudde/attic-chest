> Parody — Impromptu — composed in the Laurel Bower.. after a slight doze

Said a Cough to a Sneeze,  
Like the soft-passing breeze  
While it raved like the wind in rough weather  
“Little Sneeze I declare,  
It strange doth appear  
That we should be here both together.”

“I was caused by a strong snuff  
Rather more than enough,  
From a Beau’s thumb and finger proceeding.”  
“And the truth to unveil  
I came to conceal  
So flagrant a breach of good breeding.”

Cries the Sneeze, “Then I swear,  
Brother Cough, it is clear,  
We are twins, and rappee is our Mother  
And most woeful grimace,  
Shall distort ev’ry face  
That attempts our joint efforts to smother.
