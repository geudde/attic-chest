Short is my tale and simple. One pale morn,  
When the vex’d sun look’d sadly on the wreck  
Made by the midnight storm, a sailor-boy  
Lay gasping on the shore; his sunburnt hands  
Twin’d in the ringlets of a famish’d child,  
Which nestled in his bosom. An ag’d dame  
Rais’d the poor nursling from his cold embrace,  
While his faint dying eye again unclos’d,  
To look a last farewell. In holy turf  
She wrapp’d the stranger’s corse; but me she gave  
To a Baronial Chieftain, whose proud heart  
Had, like the stony region where he dwelt,  
One rich and warm recess. He lodg’d me there,  
For he was childless, and his coming age  
Wanted a fount of joy. With him I liv’d,  
In the green lap of a secluded vale,  
Far from the haunts of men; and many a spring  
The hoary Baron smil’d to see me bound   
Wild as his own red deer among the cliffs,  
Or startle echo with the clam’rous horn  
Which urg’d his darling chase: but more I lov’d,  
When the last purple ting’d the misty eve,  
To seek the sailor-boy’s unshelter’d grave,  
Or the white hut among the osiers hid  
Of her who lov’d me first.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Twelve summer suns  
Had shone upon my boyhood when the hall  
Of noble Howard rang with festive shouts  
Hailing his new-born heir — a beauteous babe,  
Such as heav’n lends to show how cherubs smile,  
And promise love to Man! It grew and twin’d,  
Like a sweet flow’r in kindly Autumn’s wane,  
Round its half-wither’d parent, dropping sweets.  
These were my days of bliss!—the gentle boy  
Smil’d on his orphan playmate, and my heart  
Grew rich when guided by my guardian arm  
He climb’d the tow’ring crag and brought the spoils  
Of the snar’d eaglet home. We rov’d together  
Brothers in soul and love, but Joy’s own hand  
Had shap’d Fitzhoward’s heart and touch’d the orb  
Of his blue beaming eye. It was a gladness  
To hear his voice: his lip was Laughter’s throne,  
And sighing Age could scarce remember grief  
When he was Pleasure’s minister.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;These days,  
These golden days decay’d, as Autumn’s leaves  
Fall when their tints are richest. One bright morn  
The heathcock lur’d me to a distant glen  
Where rocks on rocks a dim pavilion shap’d,  
Green with the moss of ages: in the midst  
A slumb’ring brook lay cradled among flow’rs.  
There in the covert of far-spreading boughs  
A low-roof’d mansion stood — its pillar’d porch  
Lin’d with thick jasmines and the silver pride  
Of myrtles in their bloom. A vagrant rose  
Climb’d to the open casement where a cheek  
As pure, and of far softer damask, lean’d  
On one fair hand, while fost’ring water-drops  
Were guided by the other. Never yet  
Did young Aurora when she sheds her dew  
Smile with a blush so gracious! That low roof  
Shelter’d an ancient stranger whose best hope  
Liv’d in his bud of beauty — I had youth,  
Honour, and Hope’s bright star; but iron age  
In noble Howard clos’d the genial springs  
Of bounty and kind trust: he lov’d me well,  
But like the tree whose top is moss’d by time,  
His love gave tardy and reluctant fruit.  
Yet Emma smil’d and heard me; and my hope  
Found language to my friend, whose joyful eye  
Shone ever like a sunbeam on the source  
Of pleasure in my soul and made it bright.  
“Be bold,” he said, “pursue thy love and smile!  
My father’s av’rice shall not blight its bloom:  
Go, woo thy bride’s grave sire, and bid him light  
The faggot on his hearth with Christmas-cheer,  
Old Howard shall be there!”  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The cottage hearth,  
Shone thro’ a bow’r of holly, and the board,  
White with the snowy web from Emma’s loom,  
Her lavish hand enrich’d with ev’ry cate  
Won from the dairy’s or the garden’s pride  
By housewife Art, to greet her noble guest.  
Smiles deck’d her cheek — such smiles as fairies wear  
When on saints’ eve they lurk in village bow’rs  
To mock a lover’s spell. Her ancient Sire  
In glossy beechen chair full proudly sat,  
Eying the crest still pictur’d on his wall  
In heraldry’s dim hues. — The Baron comes!  
Propp’d on his iv’ry staff — his forest-coat  
Chang’d for a stiff brocade; his brow enshrin’d  
In curls voluminous of fleecy white,  
By time made rev’rend; his capacious vest  
Emboss’d with wondrous flow’rs and gems and gold!  
Thrice in kind greeting from his hand he drew  
His broad-fring’d glove, and spoke. “Sir, well I deem  
The son of my adoption has deserv’d  
Your Daughter’s love, and blessings from our hands:  
Be this his nuptial eve: the greenest fields  
Of Borrodale and Skyrocks shall afford  
A spacious glebe to grace his chapel-house:  
And half my son’s fair birth-right shall be his  
When I am gather’d to my ancestors.”  

Slow bow’d the crafty sire — “What says my Lord?  
Both Borrodale and Skyrocks?” — “Both, I vow,  
My heir shall give the Brother of his heart,  
And all that love can add!—”

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Thou shalt do this  
Degenerate boy!” a voice in thunder spoke,  
“When I am sleeping with my forefathers!”  
Then bursting from his covert in a nook,  
Forth the grim Baron strode! False God of Love!  
How look’d thy vassal when the fall’n peruke  
Loose nose, and dropping eye-brow half-reveal’d  
The Son’s fair visage to the Father’s eye!  
“Mine, mine,” he cried; “this antic craft is mine,  
In purpose sacred, tho’ in seeming base:  
Be mine the penalty!” — “Impostor, hence!  
Thy scarlet hose, gemm’d shoes, and broider’d coat,  
(Stolen from thy grandsire’s chest) shall henceforth be  
Thy sole inheritance. Avoid my roof  
Thou and the traitor by my dotage rear’d!  
But know his thriftless love is Emma’s mock —  
Behold thy Father’s Bride!”  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Abhorr’d Remembrance!  
It lingers at my heart — That fatal eve  
The wily Syren, long to av’rice sold,  
The hoary widower wedded — and we twain  
A frantic Lover and forsaken Son,  
Sought in the Hermit’s Dale a lone abode;  
To Woman’s craft both victims and both foes,  
Sworn foes for ever. A lone chapel stands  
Beside our cloister, where when Twilight fades  
And wither’d leaves make moan, I sit and muse  
On love which fades like them. And oft I teach  
Our pensive Brotherhood how ev’ry tribe  
Is scourg’d by Woman’s: e’en the pannier’d ass  
Slave to a rustic’s household — the tame goose  
Robb’d of its down — the spider and the bee  
Whose architecture by her touch is crush’d!  
But blithe Fitzhoward in unmeasur’d bowls  
Of the spic’d alder’s juice or amber ale  
Steeps his sore wrongs. His mirth illumes my heart,  
As aquafortis in a hollow shell  
Streaks its pale milky coat with vivid hues  
And changes chalk to silver. But at night  
We circle round our board, and tell strange tales  
Of stepdames cruel, and of hair-breadth scapes  
From purseless spinsters, dowagers, and wives  
Till even the Bottles weep!!!  

Mr Editor,

As my history is included in Brother St Alme’s, he sends it early to give satisfaction. I thank the *Ladies* of you Attic Circle for their anxious curiosity respecting *me*, and am, while at a safe distance,

Their very humble servant

Fitz Howard
