![Rose](rose.jpg?resize=300)

I drink the dew from the cup of the flow’r,  
I sport in the sunbeam that follows the show’r:  
My soft couch is purple with violets bespread,  
A wild-rose the canopy over my head.  
When sweet-breathing zephyr announces the spring,  
I roam thro’ the gardens and fields on his wing:  
At noontide if Phoebus too ardently glows,  
My shelter I seek in the breast of the rose.

When the curfew bell has rung  
And dusky shadows round are flung:  
When the humming beetle flies,  
And her wing the owlet tries,  
When flow’rets close their little bells,  
And bees are in their waxen cells  
Then I haunt the whisp’ring grove,  
And hear the tales of mortal love.  
There I hear the flatt’ring youth  
(Cupid knows with how much truth!)  
Tell the maid that her bright eyes  
Vie with stars of summer skies;  
That she’s fair as yonder moon,  
And her cheek like rose of June!  
What pity! what pity men deceive!  
O what pity men deceive!  
And that mortal maids believe!  
Men deceive, Men deceive,  
Mortal maids believe!  

But I drink the dew from the cup of the flow’r,  
I sport in the sunbeam that follows the show’r:  
My soft couch is purple with violets bespread,  
A wild-rose the canopy over my head:  
At noontide if Phoebus too ardently glows,  
My shelter I seek in the breast of the rose,  
The breast of the rose!
