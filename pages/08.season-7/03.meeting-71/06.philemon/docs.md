Electro Magus, sapient man!  
Declares, that by his charging plan  
He can make poets by the score,  
Of those who ne’er have rhymed before!  
He says that his electric shocks  
The door of poetry unlocks  
And every dormant verse awakes  
And dullness from his pinion shakes  
When strait-way lively couplets mingle  
With triplets gay in tuneful jingle.

But yet dear Lady there are those  
Who would have glided on in prose  
Spite of the rhyme-inspiring panic  
Produced by Battery Galvanic  
But for the wonder working power  
Which brings to *all* their rhyming hour  
For show me one, who e’er have loved  
And not the inspiration proved  
I thought that Love would not have found  
His way *again*, this heart to wound,  
But Ah! thine eyes, so fair and bright  
Feathered the arrow, gave the light.

Philemon
