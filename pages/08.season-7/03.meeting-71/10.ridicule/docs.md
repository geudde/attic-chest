Since in your Chancery of Wit  
Pockets have fil’d a Bill, ’tis fit  
That I, with due deliberation,  
Should make demur and replication.  
Let Plaintiff Pocket understand  
He is no native of the land:  
He came, as Thomas Hearne can show,  
From Anjou with King Stephen’s foe;  
(But only an exterior pendent  
Like me, the much-abus’d defendant)  
Stiff with brocade and fringes broad  
To grace the belt of Empress Maud:  
Not fill’d with needles and thread-papers  
Fit only to give Belles the vapours,  
But with a dagger shrewed and keen  
That might have kill’d before ’twas seen;  
Not like the Beauties of to-night  
Which would, but only wound at sight.  

Shall I to Plaintiff Pocket crouch  
Whose truest cognomen is Pouch?  
All Saxon Chronicles combine  
To prove the Pocket masculine;  
And ev’ry modern Bard or Knight  
Keeps one for dinner or for fight,
