Since in your Chancery of Wit  
Pockets have fil’d a Bill, ’tis fit  
That I, with due deliberation,  
Should make demur and replication.  
Let Plaintiff Pocket understand  
He is no native of the land:  
He came, as Thomas Hearne can show,  
From Anjou with King Stephen’s foe;  
(But only an exterior pendent  
Like me, the much-abus’d defendant)  
Stiff with brocade and fringes broad  
To grace the belt of Empress Maud:  
Not fill’d with needles and thread-papers  
Fit only to give Belles the vapours,  
But with a dagger shrewed and keen  
That might have kill’d before ’twas seen;  
Not like the Beauties of to-night  
Which would, but only wound at sight.  

Shall I to Plaintiff Pocket crouch  
Whose truest cognomen is Pouch?  
All Saxon Chronicles combine  
To prove the Pocket masculine;  
And ev’ry modern Bard or Knight  
Keeps one for dinner or for fight,  
With flasks of powder and of ale  
Lest needful ammunition fail:  
And, ergo, ev’ry Belle should vote  
To leave the Pocket to the coat.

But I my true descent can trace  
From workbags, glory of our race!  
For when on ancient Ida’s top  
Three Goddesses perplex’d a fop,  
Venus, secure his heart to charm  
Took but a workbag on her arm;  
And Cupid, when he went to school,  
Call’d it his mother’s Ridicule:  
Thus from a legend of high fame  
I trace my station and my name.  

With skill and prudence ev’ry hour  
I aid my first employer’s pow’r:  
On Beauty’s graceful arm I play  
Or Cupid’s messages convey:  
Myself a type of Beauty’s mind  
Clos’d fitly, but with softness lin’d;  
The golden clasps which hold me show  
All busy Cupid can bestow.  

Chief of the Chancery of Wit!  
My case for judgement I submit;  
And with a hearing am content, if  
In open court you call the Plaintiff.  
Since Pockets, as I make it clear,  
Of nature masculine appear,  
Let them, as lordly husbands should,  
Be purse-bearers for public good,  
But let the bag which bears my name  
Like wives, the lighter treasures claim:  
So I shew cause and beg a rule  
To be your servant
