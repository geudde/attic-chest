Traveller of the summer night!  
When the moon shines broad and bright  
Thou pursuest thy way with glee  
Thoughtless of the glow-worm’s light.  
But Traveller, behold how soon  
The heavy clouds obscure the moon!  
And wrap in gloom each hill and tree!  
And tho’ thou turnest not to see  
The glow-worm trims her lamp for thee.  
And still thou keepest on thy way  
Well pleased with Cynthia’s mimic day,  
But when no longer on the stream  
Shall play her glitt’ring fitful beam  
When all her fickle light is gone  
She leaves thee darkling and alone!  
*Then*, turn thee, Traveller, and see  
The fairy-lamp is lit for thee!
