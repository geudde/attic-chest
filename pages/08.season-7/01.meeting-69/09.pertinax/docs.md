<div class="author">Miss Porden</div> 

by Pertinax Townly Bart.

Ye Muses seize your golden lyres  
This hour your liveliest strains requires  
Strike loud you gayest, sweetest string  
Your tribute to my Lord to bring.  
He comes! the morn new beauty wears  
&emsp;New flowers the laughing meads adorn  
New grace in every scene appears  
&emsp;And plenty spreads her lavish horn.

With thee each hour some new delight  
Impels the moment’s rapid flight,  
No care disturbs the mind, for here  
No care can come when thou art near.  
On thee the favor’d birth of fate  
&emsp;The loves and sportive graces smil’d  
On thee Minerva deign’d to wait,  
&emsp;And Phoebus own’d thee for his child.  

Art at thy word her stores display’d  
Thy hand her truest pencil sway’d  
While from thy lips new beauties taught  
Her sweetest graces Music caught  
Science for thee her look serene  
&emsp;In smiles of winning sweetness dressed,  
While thy soft hand with friendly care  
&emsp;To beauty smooth’d her rugged vest.

My Patron, let thy smiles impart  
New rapture my duteous heart,  
Tho’ rough and weak my strain, thy praise  
Shall tune to verse the limping lays  
Thy bounteous hand the means supplies  
&emsp;To gain in song a deathless name  
I win; but thou confer’st the prize  
&emsp;Of Immortality and Fame.  

Belov’d and happy, may’st thou live  
Blest with each joy that life can give  
And Ah! that of thy favor’s beam  
Some straggling ray on me might gleam,  
For oh! than mine no fonder heart  
&emsp;Can to thy gentle empire bow  
Thy smiles my liveliest bliss impart  
&emsp;Thy frowns inflict my deepest woe.

P.T.
