We live in the vale of St John, because there is water and sod;  
And limit our number to seven, because we are *wise* men and *odd*;  
But as hermits of seventy and seven are said to be too fond of prosing  
We tell all our tales in odd verse and write them to keep us from dosing;  
And lest you should think us strange creatures, crept into a comical new ark,  
Our lives shall be published and sold, as a modern appendix to Plutarch;  
And then you may judge whether Chilo, or Bion, or old Periander,  
Were wiser than we who hang love, and drown care, and sometimes bury anger.  
We write for Posterity’s sake; tho’ (as somebody said to our betters)  
The Post-master-general Time may never deliver our letters.  
Mr Editor, this is the whole; for compliment only parade is;  
And if I should add any more; you’d think us a club of *Young Ladies*:  
So as all our statutes forbid us to write even prose without measure,  
I seal up my note ex officio, and am with a great deal of pleasure,  

Yours &c. &c.  
Prosai Poetico

one of the Tale-telling Club or  
Brotherhood of Bioscribes.

Know ye the town of the turkey and turtle,  
Fit emblems of deeds that are done in their clime,  
Where stems of the laurel and leaves of the myrtle  
Grow broad in balconies, and glorious in rhyme?  
Where the tongue of the news-seller never is mute,  
And the orange-stands glow with their yellow-cheek’d fruit,  
Where the stains of the street and the smoke of the sky,  
And the purple of faces, are darkest in dye?  
Where statesmen are pure as the papers they sign  
And even the cloth of their coats — superfine?  
’Tis a tale of the Times! — ’tis a dream of the sun!  
Can he smile on the deeds by his Editors done  
O! — large as the sigh at a lover’s farewell  
Are the fees which they take, and the fibs that they tell!

No breath of air disturbs the march  
Of waves below Blackfriar’s arch  
Where rural dames and civic men  
Gaze on the monument of Wren: —   
Where shall we see, beyond St Paul,  
A church so stately and so tall?  
Beneath that arch, with fav’ring tide  
A lonely boatman seem’d to glide,  
Till in Queenhithe’s pellucid quay  
Safe on his silent oars he lay;  
And trembling, to the crystal wave  
His soft and secret burden gave.  
Sudden it plung’d and slowly sank  
The calm wave rippled to the bank;  
And all its tenfold wrappers sleep  
Among those treasures of the deep,  
Which ruby finger’d nymphs of Thame  
From justice and excisemen claim.  
&emsp;The Sheriff from his ware-room flies,  
Nor turns upon the Change his eyes:  
Not thus he look’d when in his way  
The precious *ball* from Indus lay  
’Tis said he goes to seek a lock  
More sure than that which guards his stock;  
For faithless hands have stolen all  
That most he priz’d — his newest shawl.  

The shawl’s large size ’twere vain to tell,  
But look on that of Bond Street belle  
It will assist thy fancy well!  
So rich, so measurelessly wide,  
’Twas camel’s hair on every side;  
Yes! — camel’s hair! and should they say  
That shawl was spun near Tyne or Tay  
By honour! I would answer nay  
And when with hyacinthine hue  
It grac’d my Lady’s vesture new,  
On her might nabobs gaze and own  
Her form deserv’d an eastern throne;  
As midst the wide Egyptian hall  
She stood superior to them all,  
And swept the marble, where her feet  
Gleam’d thro’ the stains of Lombard Street  
Like lilies of too early birth,  
That sink beneath the dews of earth.

&emsp;&#42;&emsp;&#42;&emsp;&#42;

As in the ball’s capacious room,  
The glossy pride of Delhi’s loom;  
From yellow camels of cashmere,  
Adorns the winter of the year;  
So Beauty wraps the heart of man  
(Tho’ cold as snows of Astrakhan)  
In many a soft and tangled fold  
Of mimic silk and seeming gold.  
But seen too oft at rout or ball,  
Woe waits the Beauty and the Shawl;  
For every touch that woos their stay  
Will wear their brightest hues away,  
Till in neglected corners thrown  
The shawl and lady fade alone.

&emsp;&#42;&emsp;&#42;&emsp;&#42;

November’s days have number’d nine  
And civic chiefs are met to dine:  
The foremost Sheriff fills his place  
Conspicuous by his ample face:  
The rest in lengthening throng the while  
Come slowly thro’ the long defile.  
The board a mountain fabric bears  
While famish’d gazers crowd their chairs  
And theirs shall be a feast tonight  
Shall tempt them till tomorrow’s light  
Amidst a turtle’s vast tureen  
Has shrunk before their onset keen;  
And left a chasm wide and bare  
For pies that come to perish there,  
Each side the middle dish there lay  
Small scattered fragments of the fray,  
By mighty chiefs and elders riven  
From fish of sea, and fowl of heaven,  
For where is he that hath beheld  
Their famine at a feast dispell’d?  

&emsp;&#42;&emsp;&#42;&emsp;&#42;

“But who is yon whose eager fork  
Far flashes in its deadly work?  
’Tis he — ’tis he — I know him now —   
I know him by his shaggy brow,  
I know him by his felon look  
Tho’ in a councilman’s peruke —   
The faithless friend who stole my shawl  
He stole my shawl — the very best!  
And worse than faithless, *drown’d the rest!”*  
The Sheriff spake, and as he said,  
A bottle whistled by his head. 

&emsp;&#42;&emsp;&#42;&emsp;&#42;

With weapon shiver’d to the hilt,  
Yet dripping with the sauce he spilt;  
Still fix’d upon the sever’d joint  
That quivers on its faithful point;  
His wig dislodg’d with sudden whirl,  
And cleft in twain its firmest curl,  
His robe in holes unnumber’d riven,  
His back to earth, his feet to heaven,  
The Sheriff lies — his finger end  
Still pointing at his faithless friend;  
While o’er him stands that friend with brow  
As bruis’d as his that bled below.

To cheat the softest hearts are prone  
But such may cheat themselves alone;  
Too timid others’ wealth to grudge  
Too meek to meet or brave a judge:  
But only mighty hearts can feel  
The glorious pride which bids them ***Steal***  
And if an empty purse they fear,  
Let those that fill their own, beware!  
The keenest pangs that felons find  
Are rapture to the dreary void,  
The tranquil dullness of the mind,  
The waste of feelings unemploy’d!  
We pant for joys we cannot share;  
Content — ’tis monstrous woe to bear!  
And souls in vile oblivion left  
Must fly at last for ease, to theft.  
For who can bear to leave behind  
A gorgeous banquet, tho’ he’s din’d?  
Who would not then demand of fate  
To *eat* yet not to know he *ate*?

The mind that broods in patient ease  
So like the bear in Norway’s cave  
The snows around their captive freeze  
Till in his living grave,  
One sole and scant relief he draws  
By self instruction from his paws —   
Thus are the meek in spirit lost,  
Or hid, like Norway’s bears, in frost.

&emsp;&#42;&emsp;&#42;&emsp;&#42;

Think not I took thy shawl for gold —   
No, Sheriff! no — it is not sold,  
Alas! — the seller first must buy —   
I only watch’d and wish’d to try —   
But could not for my wasted purse  
Was empty as ’tis now — or worse.  
Take back thy shawl, or take my life;  
I care not so I please my wife.  
She wish’d a mantle from Cashmere  
As something welcome, new, and dear:  
She wish’d it then — she wish’d it still  
Her wish was stronger than my will.  
Waste not thy wonderment — her tongue  
Is mightier than e’er poet sung:  
I cannot if I would be blest —   
I want no paradise but rest! —   
For then — I tell thee, Sheriff! then  
I heard her — yes, she talk’d again;  
And I, before the morn, was seen  
That beaten spouse which thou hast been.

She rag’d — I dare not tell the how,  
But look, ’tis written on my brow!  
There read of woman’s hand the pow’r  
In traces lasting to this hour!  

&emsp;&#42;&emsp;&#42;&emsp;&#42;

They tell thee, in the waters roll  
The bale thou hadst — the bale I stole!  
If true — if in thy civic chair  
Thou mean’st to cite me to the may’r,  
O spread thy mighty mandate o’er  
My wife, who then will chide no more!  
Or send me o’er the broadest sea: —   
But friends or foes, whate’er ye be  
In mercy, send her not with me  
Or farther hence transport my soul  
Than tongues can reach or wives control.  

He scap’d — and of his name and race  
Left not a token nor a trace;  
Save what we brothers must not say  
Who met him on his midnight way  
And this is all we ever heard  
Of him he robb’d, or her he fear’d.
