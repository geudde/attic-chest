<span class="title">To my Guardian, Lord Aircastle</span>

Accept, my Lord, a votive song  
From one who cannot think it wrong  
To praise what most delights a Belle,  
An Institution quite nouvelle!  

The Russel and the Royal now  
Are only fit for drones, I vow;  
But even a Lady or a Peer  
May catch a spark of science here.  

Delightful thought! when half the town  
To Brighton and salt baths go down,  
We, by a touch of magic wire,  
Can brace our nerves in fluid fire.  
 
Redeem’d by you from Queen’s Square School  
From bells of lead and iron rule,  
Can I my gratitude express  
To-day, before ’tis time to dress?  
 
The park is dull, the Mall unclean,  
No Court, no Op’ra to be seen!  
No gorgeous fires, no mighty crimes  
To charm us in Childe Harold’s rhymes:  
 
Come then, my Lord, with gracious chat  
Of smoke and science and all that,  
Display, while on your throne you sit,  
The pow’rs of potash and of wit.  

Teach me with classic taste to seek  
In busts, *like you*, the pure antique:  
To study granite more than grace,  
And lamina instead of lace.  

Come; with electric sparks renew  
My fading cheek’s vermillion hue;  
Such sparks a cheaper rouge bestow  
Than Dyde and Scribe will ever show.  

In Piccadilly and Pall-Mall  
How quick these Leyden jars would sell,  
If wives could make their husbands be as  
Adventurous as old Cunaeus!  

The flattest and the dullest thing  
Conveys a strong electric sting,  
And I, perhaps, a spark may show  
Receiv’d, my noble Lord, from you!
