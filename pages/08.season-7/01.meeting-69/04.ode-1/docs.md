##### Ode on Lord Aircastle’s Visit  

1

Awake, awake, ye slumb’ring Nine!  
And fill with energy divine  
&emsp;Of verse a humble Daughter,  
Who, smit with love of sacred song  
At inspiration’s fount has long  
&emsp;Quaff’d the Castalian water.

2

Whether with charming Moore ye stray  
In old Anacreon’s devious way  
&emsp;Or with dear Skeffy toy;  
With monks and ghosts fill Lewis’ head  
Or still o’er Byron’s revels shed  
&emsp;A melancholy joy:  

3

Whether, with Scott, o’er Tow’r and Town  
And Loch and Brae for flight ye bowne,  
&emsp;Or with the Laureat sore;  
Or with pathetic Rosa weep,  
Or with Fitzgerald’s hearers sleep  
&emsp;Amid the loyal roar;  

4

Whether at classic Thurlow’s side  
Ye sing to charm his new-made bride,  
&emsp;Or, clad in simplest vest,  
By Windermere’s romantic lake  
Your morn and ev’ning walks ye take  
&emsp;With Wordsworth and the rest,  

5

Hear and attend! — Descend and sing!  
To rapture tune each trembling string!  
&emsp;Great Aircastle’s approach  
To this, his scientific reign,  
Must now be sun in loftiest strain,  
&emsp;For hark! — I hear his coach.

6

O thou! — Mecaenas of the age!  
Artistic, chemic, classic sage,  
&emsp;Soul of inventions new!  
Electric and mechanic art  
Mnemonics, music, all impart  
&emsp;A matchless grace to you!

7

And oh! — if fancy’s humbler flights,  
Or pen that sweet romance indicts,  
&emsp;That lofty soul may charm,  
Permit a sad and widow’d dame  
To kindle at thy living flame  
&emsp;A spark her breast to warm!  

8

But Ah! “a widow’d dame,” said I?  
That word new fills each tear-fraught eye,  
&emsp;Wakes woe that erst did sleep;  
No more the tuneful period flows  
With aught but Artemisia’s woes,  
&emsp;And I can nought by weep!  

9

Come then, my tears, speak tomes of grief,  
And Aircastle shall give relief  
&emsp;B’ Electromagus’ hand;  
No more with unavailing woe  
I rave, but strains pathetic flow  
&emsp;O’er all th’ admiring land!
