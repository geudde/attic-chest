O who can say what witching tones  
&emsp;The Elfin Harp can ring!  
But O! — to play that Elfin Harp  
&emsp;It were no earthy thing!  
For it was made in fair Elfland  
&emsp;With spell and grammary;  
By sprites of air, of earth, and fire,  
&emsp;Who wrought it cunningly.  
The Queen of Faery will’d it so,  
&emsp;And in her bow’r it hung,  
And many an Elfin Lady there  
&emsp;To its soft music sung.  
The Elfin Harper that on it play’d  
&emsp;Was full of mirth and glee  
And oft in minstrel garb array’d  
&emsp;Join’d mortals’ revelry.  
By Merlin taught sweet Music’s art,  
&emsp;He sang of Tristram bold,  
And of Sir Launcelot du Lake  
&emsp;The wondrous tale he told.  
The knights who sat at Arthur’s board  
&emsp;Each one he knew full well;  
And all the stories of their loves  
&emsp;Right dextrously could tell.  
’Twas he who to King Arthur’s court  
&emsp;The tell-tale Mantle bore  
Which ev’ry faulty dame betray’d,  
&emsp;But Craddock’s Lady wore.  
’Twas he who charm’d the Ouphs and Fays  
&emsp;The livelong summer’s night,  
Till suddenly the royal grace  
&emsp;Was turn’d on mortal wight.  
Oh! had you seen our fairy court  
&emsp;All carpeted with green,  
And in the ’midst a violet bank  
&emsp;Where sat our lovely Queen!  
High on each side her fragrant seat  
&emsp;Two stately lilies grew  
And on each silver flow’r there hung  
&emsp;A drop of trembling dew.  
A ring of sparkling glow-worms shed  
&emsp;Soft lustre through the bow’r,  
And lovely female Fays were seen  
&emsp;To peep from ev’ry flow’r.  
Before the throne this crystal harp  
&emsp;The Elfin Minstrel play’d,  
While Philomela ceas’d her lay  
&emsp;To listen in the glade.  
Oh! Thomas true of Ercildowne!  
&emsp;How great was then thy skill  
The Laureat’s seat in Elfinland  
&emsp;To be thy hap to fill!  
But jealous of a rival’s pow’r,  
&emsp;Our angry Minstrel grew;  
And far away from fairy-bow’r,  
&emsp;The Elfin Harper flew.  
But Ettrick’s bards have heard his song  
&emsp;By Ettrick’s silver stream,  
While tiny Elves in mirthful throng  
&emsp;Inspir’d the shepherd’s dream.  
And now to Stella’s service bound  
&emsp;Its chords light Sylphs obey,  
And while they guard the sacred ground  
&emsp;In mystic circles play.  
But none in poesy unskill’d  
&emsp;Can hear the magic strain;  
And none but he untrue to love  
&emsp;Will break this Harp in twain!
