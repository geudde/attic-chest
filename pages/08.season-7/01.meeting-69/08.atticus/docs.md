##### A Sonnet

by Atticus Scriblerus, Junr.

Not all that in the heavenly muse delight  
&emsp;And science wonders, O renowned Lord!  
Wise tho’ they be, or brave as crystal light,  
&emsp;To learning’s sons protection do afford;  
Which if they did, high fame would them accord  
&emsp;The poet’s verse, vow’d to immortal years:  
But who shall swell thy fame, transcendent Lord!  
&emsp;Which asks the music of the heavenly spheres?  
Thou com’st, and ev’ry face fresh joyance wears,  
&emsp;Within our orb electric, genius-fraught;  
Thou com’st, and to the winds we cast our cares,  
&emsp;And tune our lyres, and wake heroic thought,  
For thou, of all the world th’ accomplished Peer,  
Dost rule our hearts and doubly govern here!
