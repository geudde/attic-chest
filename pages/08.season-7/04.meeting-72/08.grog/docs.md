<span class="title">A Parody “almost impromptu” made at the Dinner Table</span>

1

O Lady, mix no Grog for me,  
Or mix it of the French Brand&#7923;!  
Too ardent flows the Whiskey light,  
Jamaica Rum is all too bright,  
The Crême de Rose and Noyeau fine  
May cheer a heart less sad than mine,  
But, Lady, mix no Grog for me,  
Or mix it of the French Brand&#7923;!  

2

Let dimpled mirth his soul refine  
With bright Champagne’s quick-sparkling wine;  
The juice that near Oporto grew  
To politician sage be due;  
Deady’s Old Tom makes porters live,  
But that Matilda will not give;  
Then, Lady, mix no grog for me,  
Or mix it of the French Brand&#7923;!

Let merry England proudly rear  
Her frothy Porter, bought so dear;[^1]  
Let Albin quaff, till utterance fail,  
Her “Barley-broo”, her much-loved Ale;  
In Erin’s mantling glass be seen  
The Usquebagh, so bright and sheen;  
But when you mix my grog for me,  
Oh mix it of the French Brand&#7923;!

Yes, fill for me the goblet high,  
And I will drain that goblet dry;  
And when a few short sips are past,  
And I have stirr’d and drunk the last,  
When freely rings the clashing spoon  
Against the glass — which will be soon —   
Then, Lady, fill again for me,  
And fill it of the French Brand&#7923;!
