&emsp;Upon the vast Pacific’s tranquil tide  
The last faint glow of evening crimson died  
Yet still an hundred cannon blaze and roar  
And host unnumber’d press the trembling shore  
For still proud Gallia’s hated ensign flew  
And Britain’s gallant ships their foe pursue.

&emsp;The solar ray is gone, but who can miss  
Its feebler light in such a blaze as this!  
The Orient now, its seamen’s funeral pyre,  
Springs to the skies, a mass of living fire  
And where the gay pagoda’s giant height,  
Through clustering foliage rises on the sight,  
Or where the Arts triumphant hold their reign  
And deck returning Concord’s classic fane  
Or where the sportive fairies love to rove  
Thro’ farther Kensington’s romantic grove,  
An hundred rapid tourbillons aspire  
And hissing serpents vomit floods of fire,  
In lurid air unnumber’d rockets rise  
And brighter stars adorn the wondering skies

&emsp;And not less bright, though gayer was the scene  
Where youth and beauty throng th’ enamell’d green  
What! tho’ ere morn a dusky hue it wore,  
Nor grass was seen where grass had grown before  
Yet there a thousand bright pavilions blaze,  
Stars, crowns, and crescents dart their mingled rays;  
See Trafalgar the red-cross flag display;  
The anchor blazing from Aboukir Bay;  
On flaming poles the world unwearied turns  
While peace in lines of living amber burns,  
And well-earn’d fame the sparkling laurel sheds  
O’er Wellington and Nelson’s victor heads.  
There, all around light strains of music call  
To Bacchus’ temple, or the festive hall  
The splendid theatre and sprightly ball.  

&emsp;In musing mood, with look sedate and proud  
Walked sage Diogenes amid the crowd,  
Rich with the classic lore of antient times,  
His mind disdain’d these rude unpolish’d climes,  
Disgusted, tired, he vainly sought a home  
The chasten’d elegance of Greece or Rome.  
Careless he saw the light balloon arise  
And science bear a mortal to the skies.  
But had he mark’d his lofty spirit quell’d  
Had mourn’d to see Daedalian art excell’d.  
Yon pile Chinese his purer taste offends,  
By no just rules yon arch of triumph bends,  
And for those tents now waving in the breeze  
Those painted lanterns dangling from the trees,  
Or yon proud fortress, that barbaric pile  
Was the true product of this tastless isle.  
If other eyes could bear them, his could not —   
He turn’d indignant and he left the spot.  
<span class="pencil">Yet still, as in some mystic circle bound</span>  
<span class="pencil">He sought the busier fair’s capacious round.</span>  
Why came he *Here?* this scene of tumult claims  
No kindred with Olympia’s vaunted games.  
No kings or heroes wrestle for the prize,  
And, armour clad, no chief his foe defies.  
Here to the goal no eager chariots flew,  
No giant arm the massy discus threw,  
The ruder bar was banish’d from the place,  
Proscrib’d the emulative donkey-race,  
And should two youths a *milling match* demand  
No brazen Caestus arm’d each brawny hand.  
And yet perchance, if truth were fairly told,  
Remov’d the reverence paid to times of old  
Or if uncleans’d each hero’s desperate rage,  
By the soft stream of many a filtering age.  
The English fair, the country games, the race,  
Have less of cruelty, and more of grace.  
Yet thought not so Diogenes, I ween,  
Who ey’d disdainful this delighted scene  
He said that to compare and judge, he came  
But judg’d before, and meant but to condemn.

&emsp;He turn’d — a different scene, but not less bright,  
Fix’d the philosopher’s admiring sight.  
Their liveliest notes the jocund rebecks sound,  
And youths and maids in sprightly circles bound.  
Here rival theatres the eyes engage,  
And woo to Saunders’ or to Gyngell’s stage.  
Oh! may no storms their flimsy walls assail  
That seem to wave with every passing gale,  
Oh! how unlike those theatres of yore,  
At fam’d Telmessus, or on Cuido’s shore,  
That held a nation, and might stand the shock  
Of earthquakes chisel’d in the living rock.  

&emsp;Here were all monsters land or sea supplies  
To please the vulgar, and to pose the wise,  
An Arimaspian Pig — a cat that bore  
A head behind, <span data-tippy="besides its head" class="green">as well as one</span> before  
A little kraken, and a mermaid fair  
What with a crab divides her grassy hair  
(Alas how different from Cymodoce  
And all her soft-eyed sisters of the sea)  
And here were giants shown, and dwarfs, and apes,  
And wondrous men of various kinds and shapes,  
Some with red eye, and face like lily pale,  
One with three hands,[^1] and one that wore a tail  
But vainly sought the sage, in elder times  
The races fabled in remoter climes.  
That eyes within their headless bosoms bear,  
Or sleep at night in either spacious ear,  
Hop on one leg, or should it better suit,  
Can make a large umbrella of their foot.  

&emsp;But who are these that round and round proceed,  
In dizzy whirl, and urge the wooden steed!  
Or these, that in revolving chariots driven,  
Now sink to Earth, and now ascend to heaven!  
“Here,” thought Diogenes, “the sage may find,  
Two different pictures of the human mind.  
Passive, the first in measured circles wheel,  
Nor rise, nor fall, nor seem to think or feel.  
The next — ambition often bids them rise,  
And fate often hurls them downward from the skies,  
Yet still thro’ every change, erect in all,  
Fearless they soar, and sink but never fall.  
&emsp;But lo! where swings in number match the stars  
What myriad throng to fill their spacious cars!”  
What bursts of laughter and what joyful cries  
Break from each happy damsel as she flies!  
Where’er the sage his eyes admiring bends,  
In endless files the moving line extends,  
Joy fills each breast — Oh! what a charming thing,  
To those whose heads can bear it, is a swing!  
“Whence comes this pleasure? can this giddy whirl,”  
He said, “thus charm each giddier youth and girl?  
Does *it* impart that light to every eye?  
I can’t believe it — but, by Jove, I’ll try.”

&emsp;The cords all creak as he ascends the chair,  
A direful omen, for tho’ thin and spare,  
Our British cynic was not fed on air.  
And now he swings: he gives his soul to joy  
His heart exulting as he seems to fly,  
His friends beneath in mute amazement stare,  
And wonder, “How the devil he got there!”  
While to and fro the active chariot swung,  
Enraptured, thus the sage spontaneous sung.  

&emsp;“How smooth and easy doth this motion seem!  
Methinks I soar in some delightful dream!  
Can modern fools this great invention boast?  
No! Greece possessed it, tho’ the record’s lost!  
Thro’ all the world let Caesar’s triumphs ring,  
I envy not his fame — be mine a swing!  
Nor smile ye kings, for though ye soar on high,  
Till half the spacious Earth beneath you lie,  
Yet all is changing on this fickle ball,  
Like me alternately ye rise and fall  
And envious fate may cut th’ upholding string,  
And hurl ye headlong from your lofty swing — ”  

&emsp;Prophetic thought! the words were scarcely spoke,  
When, with his weight the cords deceitful broke.  
Its force centrifugal restrain’d no more  
Far thro’ the air the flying chariot bore.  
Nor did it rest, until our traveler laves  
His forehead in the cool Pacific waves;  
But with the rising car he rose again,  
And floated on the bosom of the main.  
Like Burney’s self in coat and wig array’d  
When Thames! thy green-hair’d daughters round him play’d,  
Now here, now there, as winds and waters drive,  
With whose impetuous force t’were vain to strive  
He floats — Oh! will no generous dolphin save  
No Nereid snatch her favourite from the grave,  
No — meaner hands redeem’d him from the wave.  
Borne by the friendly stream the chariot glides,  
Beneath a vessel, proud with canvas sides,  
(No trireme this, but to the favouring gales  
Three lofty masts extend the swelling sails)  
And half exhausted with the billows’ rage  
Up the tall side her seamen drag the sage.  
Who safe, though rais’d all dripping from the deep,  
Finds all inclined to laugh and none to weep,  
And hears with sorrow, as they near’d the land,  
The shouts of mirth from crowds that lined the strand.  
Thro’ gathering hosts he makes his hasty flight,  
And rues at home the follies of the night;  
Yet muttering curses as he moves along,  
On cords, and swings, and that unmanner’d throng.  
Th’invention was sublime, but who could praise,  
Degenerate swings of these degenerate days!  
The massy monuments of Grecian fame  
Must sink these flimsy, fragile works in shame —   
Oh! had he thought, that such mishap would be  
He ne’er had swung — but who could fate foresee?  
Thus pleasure’s voice oft woos the young and gay  
To sport awhile in folly’s devious way  
Their hearts are light, their hopes are strong and warm  
Experience comes too soon, and breaks the charm.
