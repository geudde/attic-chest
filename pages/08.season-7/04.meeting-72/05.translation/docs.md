M.S. Translation attempted from the Italian of Carlo Maggi, by S.P. Junr

When iron grief the bosom rends  
Thought draws up near our distant friends  
Nor lets mere space our souls divide  
But brings them instant to our side  
Then ev’ry soothing look and word  
By fancy’s power is seen and heard  
And all their wonted charm impart  
To ease the mind, and glad the heart.  
Reason *their* much-lov’d voice assumes  
Its calm the troubled breast resumes.

M.S. Lines attempted to a Russ Air by S.P. Junr

Hark! the battle’s distant thunder  
Calls me to the welcome fight,  
War-fires rend the clouds in sunder  
Fading new born light.  

Hid the tear-drop, check thy sobbing!  
Thy cossack why wouldst thou shame?  
If thy breast for him is throbbing  
Be it for his fame!  

Woman’s heart still thrills at glory  
Why then pallid shouldst thou be?  
If thy lover live in story  
Lives he not to thee?  

Death’s dark veil mine eyelids cov’ring  
Yet would leave my spirit free,  
Which around thee ever hov’ring  
Dear! should dwell with thee.
