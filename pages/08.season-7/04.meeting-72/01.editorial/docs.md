We are disappointed in not having received any further contributions from the Hermit’s Dale; as we had fully hoped to have introduced our hearers to the 5th Brother this evening. Our Chest is however well supplied, and the Drama, which we shall this night present to our friends is of such length, as to leave but little space for other matter. The students of Positive House appear to have intended the Lunatics partly as a burlesque upon themselves, and tho’ Electromagus appears to regret Lord Aircastle’s absence, we think that had he been present he might have felt in the lunar voyage something like satire on the failure of his balloon.  

We were much amused with Electromagus’s letter, particularly with the account he gives of the scientific music which composed the overture. We have no doubt that it was much superior to the panharmonicon, and that all the audience were highly gratified. By the bye we would willingly have heard more of this same audience and more of the wit of the green room, but as Electromagus is always too much engrossed by science to descend to such unimportant matters, we must wait with patiene till our lively correspondent Sir Pertinax has leisure to give us an account of them.

Mr Beauclerc has address’d a letter to the Editress complaining violently of the detention of a paper in which he has a *tender* interest by some person or persons of our Society. If it be a lady who has committed this misdemeanour, he graciously holds forth a promise of pardon, but if a gentleman, he challenges him with all the fury of an injured knight errant. Now we have no idea to what this relates, unless it be a Valentine addressed to this valorous gentleman, which having been enclosed to the Editor, reached the Chest by way of Winchester! As the delay was unintentional we trust Mr Beauclerc will excuse it, and if not, the Editor’s office of course protects him from all attacks. So he will plead privilege and decline the combat.

Another Valentine we have received addressed to Olivia. Why this is so late, the lady must not enquire of us, for it is not our fault.  

We are much amused by the Glass of Grog — a good parody on the Cypress Wreath.  

Many other pieces are in the Chest but we are obliged to defer them as well as the 6th lecture on Comparative Physiology, in consequence of the length of our Drama.
