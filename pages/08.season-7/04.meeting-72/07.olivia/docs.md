This day to common love is dear,  
And many a tale will soothe thine ear  
&emsp;Fond hope or frolic with to prove:  
The theme of minstrelsy I change —   
I bring a tribute new and strange;  
&emsp;A tale of hatred, not of love!  
I love thee not! — did ever zeal  
A rarer miracle reveal  
&emsp;Thy pity or thy mirth to move?  
’Tis true — for all thy faults I guess,  
And strive to make thy beauties less —   
&emsp;What more is hate if this be love?  
Thy wit is false, for when my cheek  
Fades with the fear which cannot speak,  
&emsp;My pangs thy careless jest improve:  
And while I tremble, how much guile  
Lurks in thy lip and points thy smile, —   
&emsp;The smile which stings yet wakens Love!  
Thine eye — a scorching fire is there,  
For tho’ I chide, I never dare  
&emsp;The keenness of its flash to prove;  
Thy voice has won the elf-harp’s sound,  
I hear it, and my tongue is bound  
&emsp;Or wanders into words of love.  
Behold thy faults! — but keep them all  
That I my senses may recall  
&emsp;When spell-bound in thy sphere they rove: —   
My malice as thy pride is great,  
There is no language fits my hate  
&emsp;Unless it tells thee that — I love!
