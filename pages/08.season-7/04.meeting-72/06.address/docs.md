Madam  

I address myself to you as Editress of the Attic Chest concerning a misdemeanour committed by some person or persons of your society.  

A paper intended for me has been detained, a paper — Madam! — in which I have a most particular, a most tender interest. If the offender be a lady, the grievance must be smiled at and forgiven. *But if a gentleman* he must know what satisfaction alone can compensate for the injury sustained  

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;by Madam yours  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Philemon Beauclerc

The choice of weapons, as usual in such cases, I shall leave to the challenger.  

He may perhaps fancy that a combat of *feathers* or *paper bullets* will suffice. And if he does think so, let him look to it, for he may assure himself that it shall suffice.  

Excuse errors, for I write during a paroxysm of rage and indignation.

To the Editress of the Attic Chest
