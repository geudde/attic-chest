’Tis said my lyre is soft and sweet,  
&emsp;Its burnished strings are gay,  
But tho’ with melody replete,  
&emsp;It will not sound today.  
Yet oft they say electric fire  
Has pierced my soul and touch’d my lyre.

’Tis true the flash was swift and strange —   
&emsp;I know not how or when —   
Thro’ all my soul I felt it range,  
&emsp;And tremble round my pen,  
But from my failing tongue it flies  
Or only lingers in my eyes.  

They say the gifted bard should praise  
&emsp;Soft beauty’s beaming eye.  
On beauty’s softest blush I gaze  
&emsp;But only gaze and sigh.  
They bid me muse on flower or gem —   
Too much I muse — but not on them!

Is this, which warms my soul and cheek  
&emsp;The pure electric flame?  
Has this which frozen sages seek,  
&emsp;No fam’d and fearful name?  
Ah! let me not the semblance prove  
Lest Sages doubt and call it Love!
