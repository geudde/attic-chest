“O where are the Chiefs of Doon and Kyle?  
&emsp;And why are our clans asleep?  
They have ta’en my Father by southron guile  
&emsp;And laid him in Donjon-Keep.  
My Father loves the brindled kine  
&emsp;Or the foray in down and dell;  
But better he loves the Warden’s wine  
&emsp;Than the Warden’s Donjon-cell!”

2

“Hast thou no brother, lady fair,  
&emsp;To mount that gallant steed,  
And break thy father’s donjon-bar  
&emsp;While southron traitors bleed?  
Hast thou no lover, fair Lady,  
&emsp;His good claymore to hold?  
One lock of thy yellow hair would buy  
&emsp;More than all the Warden’s gold:

3

I have but a Palmer’s staff and hood,  
&emsp;My wrinkled brow is grey:  
Yet there is a drop of youthful blood    
&emsp;Glows warm in my heart to-day!”&mdash;  
“Then, Palmer, give me thy mantle grey,  
&emsp;In merry Carlisle I’ll sleep;  
And my father shall laugh ere dawning day    
&emsp;At the Warden’s Donjon-keep.” 

4

The Palmer has open’d his mantle wide    
&emsp;And cast his crosier by;  
The Warden’s sword is by his side,  
&emsp;And a red light in his eye.  
Yestreen when he came to Margaret’s bow’r,  
&emsp;His tangled beard was white;  
Now his locks are like the yellow flow’r,  
&emsp;And his eye as the morning bright. 
	
5

“Kneel not, fair daughter of Buccleugh!  
&emsp;I pray thee, kneel not now!  
Thy father’s hand my Father slew,  
&emsp;Tho’ milk-white was his brow.  
Kneel not to me, sweet Margaret!  
&emsp;Still leave thy wealth untold&mdash;  
There is no Border-Baron yet    
&emsp;Who sells his hate for gold.”   

6

“Lord Warden, take the jewels bright,  
&emsp;That in my coffer lie,  
But grant one ray of morning light    
&emsp;To bless my Father’s eye!  
I’ll give thee Lauder’s greenest linn,  
&emsp;And Ettrick’s tow’r and dell,  
For one breath of the westlin wind    
&emsp;To cheer his donjon-cell!”   

7

“Nay, Lady, give thy blue eye’s light,  
&emsp;And breathe one gentle sigh,  
And I’ll pledge the faith of England’s knight    
&emsp;Thy father shall not die.  
I came a traitor’s face to seek,  
&emsp;But thine is fair and true;  
Thou has England’s red rose in thy cheek,  
&emsp;Thine eye has her holy blue.   

8

Take thou my ring as I take thine,  
&emsp;Then kiss the cup with me;  
This honest draught of rosy wine    
&emsp;Our pledge of love shall be.”   

The Warden quaff’d the silver tank&mdash;  
&emsp;The draught was long and deep:  
The next draught that the Warden drank    
&emsp;His eyes were clos’d in sleep.   
	
9

The lady has stolen the gay gold ring,  
&emsp;And the Warden’s wide mantile,  
Then she glints away like an elfin’s wing    
&emsp;To the Donjon of old Carlisle.  

“Come forth, Buccleugh, from thy donjon deep!  
&emsp;This mantle is long and wide!  
Come forth while thy foes are hush’d in sleep,  
&emsp;And haste to thy own burnside!” 
	
10

The watchman look’d from the castle-rock    
&emsp;When he heard the grey cock crow;  
And he smil’d to see the Warden’s cloak,  
&emsp;And a kirtle glide below.   

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&#42;&emsp;&#42;&emsp;&#42;&emsp;&#42;

Buccleugh is come with his daughter fair    
&emsp;To his own good Castle-ground;  
But the gallant Warden still lies there    
&emsp;In slumbers soft and sound.   
  
11

“Now peace to thy pillow, noble knight!  
&emsp;Content may thy slumbers be;  
The heart that has lov’d my Margaret    
&emsp;Shall never have wound from me.  
But thou shalt learn what faith to place    
&emsp;In the blink of a rolling eye,  
And thy King shall know in how soft a space    
&emsp;The wits of his Warden lie.”   


12

The King has ridden thro’ Carlisle town    
&emsp;With gold on his war-steed’s shoe;  
“And where,” quo’ he, “is the robber gone    
&emsp;And my Warden bold and true?”    
The King rode on to the western lea    
&emsp;To seek the robber’s track,  
But there he has found the Donjon-key    
&emsp;And his Warden&mdash;in a sack.   

13

“Now, by the road!” said the jocund King,  
&emsp;“’Tis a comely sight to see;  
Buy my loyal Cumberland can bring  
&emsp;Five hundred as fou’ as he.  
The knave Buccleugh may speed his flight  
&emsp;Safe over Tweed or Tyne  
Since he cop’d with the wit of a southron knight  
&emsp;And gave him his fill of wine.”

14

Twice foursome years has the Warden’s grave  
&emsp;Grown green in the summer gale,  
And the last of his race is a rosy knave  
&emsp;Who dwells in the Hermits’ dale:  
But there is not a dame on Tweed or Tyne  
&emsp;With an eye of blue or black  
Could give him enough of mellow wine  
&emsp;Or tie him in Cupid’s sack.
