> Sent to a lady with a paper of sticking plaister

In former times, when rich brocade  
And blond, and tissue, decked each maid,  
I held a most distinguished station,  
At every toilette in the nation,  
And gave the last bewitching grace  
To many a lovely British face.  
My willing aid I always lent,  
Whene’er with mischievous intent  
Some roguish fair her skill would try  
To add new archness to the eyes,  
Just at the corner was my post,  
Whence numerous conquests I could boast.  
And when with taper finger’s tip  
She placed me on her rosy lip,  
The smiles and loves, quick thither flew,  
And there in ambuscade they slew.  
Alas no longer ’tis my lot  
To shine an envied beauty-spot,  
No hearts I help to wound or steal  
Now all my business is, to heal!

Ensign Court-Plaister  
for many years of the
