Twas one fair eve, the stars were bright,  
Each planet beamed reflected light,  
When with a wild and angry look,  
Thus to his brother Hermes spoke.

Say Phoebus, are you made, or why  
This strange disorder in the sky,  
What does this bold intrude mean,  
This comet, with such terror seen,  
With squibs and crackers in his train  
He scours the blue etherial plain,  
Affrights the Bear, who dreads to view,  
His starry splendours torn in two.  
His tail, <span data-tippy="the pride of Arctic skies" class="green">of Arctic skies the pride</span>  
<span data-tippy="To see with terror and surprise" class="green">Bent flaming from his wounded side</span>  
<span data-tippy="Bent from his side, and flaming" class="green">And through a thousand systems</span> hurled,  
<span data-tippy="To scare some other, distant" class="green">The dread or scourge of many a</span> world.  

While I, tho’d used to take my seat,  
Close to your flaming orb of heat,  
And toast my nose beside the fire,  
In <span data-tippy="heat" class="green">warmth</span> where others would expire,

Am in a perfect fever now,  
The victim of this fervid flow.  
My trees that grew so tall and fair,  
Now show their stems all scorched and bare,  
My harvest’s burnt, my vintage spoiled,  
My fish in bubbling rivers boiled,  
And my poor tenants sadly broiled.  

In dread of still a warmer birth,  
I lately <span data-tippy="took a trip to" class="green">threw a glance on</span> Earth.  
But there, tho’ further from the sight,  
I found the natives in a fright.  
Each hour expecting to survey,  
Their globe in flames consume away.  
Nay one, so much o’erpowered with dread,  
Had to a tub of water fled,  
<span data-tippy="And chose, tho’ hopeless life to save, A wat’ry ere a fiery grave" class="green">And there for many an hour she stood  
Chin deep within th’encircling flood  
And hopeless, rather wish’d to die  
A wat’ry death, than broil or fry</span>

What may this mean, sir, I insist,  
Your visitor be straight dismissed,  
Must discord run the system thro’
