Now ruddy autumn quits our fertile plains  
And o’er our isle despotic winter reigns  
Now shady groves and fountains cease to please  
Those groves are leafless and those fountains freeze  
The vale erewhile with varied flow’rets bright  
Now hid by snow reflects a dazzling light  
With discord harsh, rude Boreas sweeps along,  
The woods, once vocal with the feathered throng,  
Who now in torpid state, refuse to sing  
Till roused to action by returning spring.  

The lofty hill, upon whose barren head,  
The scattered heath a purple lustre shed,  
Is clad in white, save where the sun bestows  
His setting crimson on the virgin snows.  
Or where a few thin blades of herbage peep,  
A scanty dinner to the nibbling sheep.  

The winding river, whose translucent wave  
To yonder meadows brighter verdure gave,  
And gently murmuring, rolled its silver tide,  
Now thunders to the main, a torrent wide.

But tho’ all nature wears and aspect drear  
And droops beneath the tyrant of the year  
Yet social intercourse the gloom can cheer  

Then why delay the votaries of the Chest,  
To break the shackles of inglorious rest  
“Awake, arise.” Let sprightly wit once more  
With graver humour cheat the lingering hour,  
With science, taste, and solid sense combined  
Enrich the varied banquet of the mind.
