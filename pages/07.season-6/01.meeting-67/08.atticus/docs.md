Descend ye bright Aonian choir  
And string anew Scriblerus’ slumbering lyre!  
Inspire his mounting song to claim  
The laureate wreath of Attic fame,  
What not his the purple juice  
Oporto’s clustering vines produce  
Which borne across the restless main  
From Tagus’ golden sanded streams  
The British laurels’ veins inflames  
While peers, and princes, slumber o’er his strain  
Tho shrunk Castalia’s warbled rills  
And Aganippe’s scarce distills  
His altered course meander mourns  
Cephisus weeps his empty urns  
And famed Ilyssus dwindled long  
Now flows but in Fitzgerald’s song  
Tho niggard rulers crib the antient sack  
Nor force nor strength Scriblerus’ strain shall lack!!!

Mine be that tide of liquid flame  
That *boasts* Batavia’s *humble* name  
Or what should more a Briton’s breast inspire  
True English Hodges’ best entire!!  
Or mine that limpid stream conveyed  
In cylinders of iron made  
Beneath Augusta’s pavement laid  
What tho full many a youth complain  
Of stockings splashed, or horse o’erthrown  
Of carriage broke, or broken bone  
Or neckcloth spoilt by iron stains.

The wise directors spurn the mean controls  
The puny prejudice of vulgar souls  
In Berners Street  
Their famed Committee meet  
Thence, as their common fount in mingled store  
Pure Attic verse, and crystal water pour.  
The grateful town deep quaffs th’inspiring tide  
At once with water and with wit supplied,  
The frigid wave with magic full  
Enchafes the stupid, warms the dull  
And as potassium in a trice  
Self-kindled burns upon the ice  
E’en thus as genius quaffs the wondrous stream  
Again his slumb’ring fires inflame  
Soar o’er the skies and grasp the wreath of fame!

Already do I feel the glow!  
In fancy’s prospect even now  
I see the embryo laurels grow!  
Fair as the Sybil’s golden bough!  
Or that bright branch Prasildo wore  
That in Medusa’s garden shone.  
Long shouts of Attic praise the welkin rend!  
As Ellen’s hands the wreath extend  
And place the verdant honors on my brow!  
To all my works the glad subscribers pour!  
Swells the long list of fashion on my eye!  
While wealthy witlings profit by my lore  
My overplus of fame in secret buy  
Grows in my view the turtle groaning board  
My bright buffet with Gallia’s vintage stored  
From golden cups the sparkling juice is poured!  
Its spirit feeds my genius’ mounting flame  
I revel in their wealth, they share my fame!

Ye Alexanders, Caesars, long renowned!  
Boast no more your deeds sublime  
Conquests over death and time  
My fame shall soar, when yours is sunk and drown’d!!!  
Homer, Virgil fade away  
At my feet their laurels lay!  
Milton stoops from Heaven, I see  
Leaves his sapphire throne for me!  
My works shall live in royal quarto bound  
When theirs in humble duodecimo are found!  
Safe in the Chest shall live my deathless lay  
Its lock, the thievish hand of time shall stay!!!
