<div class="author">Miss Flaxman</div>

Should we in plain and homely phrase tell our friends that we are happy to see them again assembled in this place, it might perchance to ears delicately constructed sound like an inelegant common mode of expression. Nevertheless if we were to overwhelm the company with a flow of compliments of the first Chesterfieldian order (*words forgot as soon as spoke*) the sense and substance would be still the same. Therefore we will say in all sincerity of heart, that we are happy to see our Attic Circle *nearly* unbroken. We say *nearly*, for we miss some of the brightest jewels of our crown. We trust however that a very little time will restore them to us in renovated lustre, to make our radiancy complete.  

He indeed who would exchange the poet’s laurel for that which is to be gathered in the field of Mars means we imagine to become the hero of his own epic, and therefore *“changes his pens for truncheons, ink for blood,”* and seeks the bubble of reputation even in the cannon’s mouth.

To our more peaceably disposed friends who prefer the evergreens of Parnassus, thus we say, that we are pleased with and grateful for their exertions and no less amused with the general and ardent desire they express for a laureateship; they shall be this evening constituted judges of their own claims and join in an amicable scramble for the attic wreath.

It is with great satisfaction we recognize the style and signature of our old friends — our much respected corresondent Fudge we intreat to proceed with his ode the first sunny day. His *Address* to Apollo will not be again *rejected*, as all the fogs of consequence has passed by. The elegant biographer of fraternity has lost none of her glory by her lines. Apollo’s remarks with regard to her Southey have unfortunately been but too prophetic. The confinement of Atticus has cast no shade of lassitude over the effusions of his Muse. We perceiver Stella and Moth again sparkling and fluttering together as heretofore, and congratulate them upon it. Miss Jenny Wren who aspires to a crown shall certainly have one of *chick-weed* and full liberty to whistle all the little tales and tittle tattle she has promised us.  
 
We hope none of our correspondents will feel hurt in not being individually mentioned but ascribe every omission to *want of time* or any cause but want of regard.
