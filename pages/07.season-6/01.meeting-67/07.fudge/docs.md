> Introduction to an Ode intended to have been written but prevented by a thick Fog.

’Twas then, yet not an eye  
In town, could see the glories of the sun!  
’Twas noon, yet not an eye  
Could see thro’ fog, the azure of the sky!  
No neighbour could his neighbour greet  
Across the street,  
For why!  
No neighbour could he spy  
Through fog so dense and dun!

’Twas noon, yet not a mouth  
From Aldgate pump to Palace Yard  
No, not a mouth, a single mouth!  
From east to west, from north to south  
Could ope  
Without inhaling  
From Thames exhaling  
A noisome Fog,  
Would choke a dog  
Or e’en a bard!

Oh fearful gloom! Oh direful damp!  
Doth it forebode  
My hapless Ode,  
My Ode probationary,  
Like vulgar stationary  
Waste paper hight  
Should, torn in scraps  
The taper light  
Or midnight lamp!

Look down Apollo!  
Great Chief of Grub Street! pray  
Dart but one ray  
One cheering ray  
To light my way:  
Thy car I’ll follow  
I’ll win the laurel crown  
I’ll charm the town  
I’ll beat them hollow!
