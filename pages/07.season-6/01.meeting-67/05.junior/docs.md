To the Editor of the Attic Chest  

> “When the pie was open,  
> The birds began to sing”  

from the black letter copy

Reclining in his coach and four,  
(The same that Phaeton drove before  
Till soaring high, as legends say  
He fell like whips of modern day  
And left his sire the debt to pay)  
As Phoebus took his daily ride,  
By chance he looked on earth and spied,  
Where Britain rules the subject ocean,  
The world of poets in commotion,  
He wondered long, till rumour said  
The poet laureate, Pye, was dead —   
“Poor Pye and is thy exit come  
I’ve many of his cards at home  
A civil man, by all I hear,  
He called upon me twice a year,  
But I was always out of late,  
And so, poor man we never met  
I’ve seen him once or twice I know  
But t’was some twenty years ago  
Well who’s appointed to succeed?  
Not that I ought to care indeed  
Since Dryden’s time nor would I wrong ’em  
I’ve seldom had a friend among ’em  
For even if intimate before  
When in they rudely shut the door  
Threw off the staff that gave support  
Nor called me in to share their *port*.  
But who’s the man?” — “Southey they say  
For Scott to him resign’d the day.”  
“Resign’d!” — “Yes! he was heard to own  
The other more deserved the crown  
I doubt it — but the thing is new  
When poets know a rival’s due  
Dean Southey! he’s my ancient friend,  
A little wild, but then he’ll mend  
He’ll need no curb ere wanes the moon  
For nothing tames a bard so soon  
And now me thinks the plan is new  
The Chest shall have a laureate too.  
Fly rumour bid its votaries strive  
Fair Ellen’s hand the wreath shall give  
And lacking port, to point their theme  
A copious glass of lemon cream  
I need not fear to quench their fire  
When roused by Ellen’s eye and lyre  
With two such themes to prompt their lays  
The Attic Chest and Ellen’s praise.”
