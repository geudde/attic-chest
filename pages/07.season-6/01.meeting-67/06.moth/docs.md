Awake! my bosom’s dormant fire  
Once more awake! my slumbering lyre  
Thy tones of melting sweetness breathe  
To win the envied Attic Wreath.  
&emsp;The pendant willows pliant bough  
Oft binds the hapless lover’s brow,  
Or blest, he loves his wreath to twine,  
Of myrtle and of gay woodbine,  
The parsley crown the hero claims  
Triumphant in funereal games  
Or victor at Nemea, shows  
The ash her black-rob’d judge bestows  
The oak the civic hero wears  
And peace her shining olive bears  
Diana, ever fair and chaste  
The Agnus castus garland grac’d  
Yet tho’ such wreath might well befall  
To fit a nymph of Tabby Hall,  
Not this I seek to bind my brow,  
Be mine the laurel’s brighter bough.  
&emsp;Not this the laurel, dipped in gore  
That Greek or Latin warriors wore,  
Nor this the aspiring tree that shed  
Unfading fame on Homer’s head  
But borne from China’s distant strand  
It proudly decks our happy land  
And rear’d by <span class="small">ELLEN</span>’s fostering care,  
Her favor’d Attic bard shall wear.  
Her call arous’d my minstrel-fire  
And woke again my idle lyre,  
Her hand bestows the meed of fame  
Her bards with emulation claim,  
And ah! against my simple lay,  
What numbers stand in bright array,  
A brother’s sense and humor there  
In friendly strife the contest share,  
Untir’d he views the noontide light,  
And soars on eagle wings from sight.  
And Anna’s wit is there display’d,  
And fair Vardilla, dark-ey’d maid,  
While wit and sense and sweetness throng,  
Commingling in her flowing song,  
A Scottish lassie next, who wears  
The grace of youth in riper years,  
Simple and sweet, her highland strain,  
Flows from, and seeks the heart again.  
There too a sage, at will who pours  
The gems of learning’s classic stores,  
His eloquence and kindness bind,  
In friendship’s *Bond* each heart and mind.  
There poignant wit and satire sly,  
Lurk in the lawyer’s half-clos’d eye  
There flows in Tiber’s stream imbued  
The grace of *Henry’s* softer mood,  
While *Atticus*, with eyes of fire  
Impetuous strikes his sounding lyre,  
Steals to the “crystal vase” and sips  
The stream sublim’d by “Ellen’s” lips,  
Displays his cookery lore, and then,  
Still eats and writes, and eats again.  
&emsp;All these, and these beside, are there  
Yet never shall my Muse despair,  
While still, (the poet’s best support)  
She holds a powerful friend at court,  
And knows her Stella’s hand were both,  
To clip the wings of faithful *Moth*.
