<span class="title">The three things a good wife ought to be, and the three things a good wife ought *not* to be.</span>

A wife, domestic, good, and sure,  
Like snail should keep within her door;  
But not like snail, in dangerous track  
Place all her wealth upon her back.  

Like a town clock, a wife should be,  
Keep time and regularity;  
But not like clocks harangue so clear  
That all the town the sound may hear

A wife should be like Echo true,  
Nor speak but when she’s spoken to;  
But not like Echo, still be heard  
Contending for the final word.  

Young man, if these allusions strike,  
She whom as wife you’d hail,  
Must be just like, and just *not* like,  
An Echo, Clock, and Snail.

<span class="title">The three things a husband ought to be, and the three things a good husband ought *not* to be.</span>

A husband, active, skilful, neat,  
Like Snail, should form his house complete;  
But not like Snail, in dang’rous track  
Pull his whole house about his back.  

Like a town clock, should husbands prove  
Make hand and tongue in order move;  
But not like clocks that falsely seen,  
Misguide the sight, and cheat the ear.

A husband should like echo be  
Reiterate his wife’s decree;  
But not like Echo, loud in prate,  
Make walls, and roof, reverberate.  

Sweet maid, if these just emblems strike,  
Thy choice not to bewail,  
Must be most *like*, and yet *un*like,  
An Echo, Clock, and Snail.

This is the composition of a friend (Miss J...n C...b) The “Three things a good *wife* ought, and ought *not* to be.” The author I do not know. F.R.
