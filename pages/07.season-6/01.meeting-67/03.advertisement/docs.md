An Attic Poet Laureate  

To furnish Odes for the New Year, the opening and closing of the Attic Season, or any other occasion worthy of being sung by the Muse.  

Competition! is the word.  

Ladies and Gentlemen;  
Mend your pens —   
Mount your Nags —   
and Hey for Parnassus!

Laurels are the fashion!
