<span class="title">A Song of Sixpence!</span>

Have you ne’er read in story old  
Of birds two dozen (as ’tis told)  
Who from the midst of pastry cold  
Began to sing?  
Like such a pie is yonder chest  
Which all the summer like a nest  
Has harbour’d may a timid guest  
With *untried* wing.   
Not blackbirds all, but birds more gay  
The goldfinch and the well drest Jay,  
And starling who can sing and say  
In sportive mood.  
The goddess with the eye of blue  
Has sent her bird to sing *too whoo!!*  
And gentle Philomela too  
From the green-wood.  
Just now they’re each as hoars as *Daw*  
But come a little gently thaw  
Then ope the Chest, the curtain draw  
They’ll pipe with glee.  
And this my neighbour Robin says  
Shall be *his* son in Winter’s praise  
While Ladies smile, and faggots blaze  
And jokes go free!  
Let others sing of vernal gales  
Of Flowery meads and dewy vales  
And tell their soft Arcadian tales  
In grots and bowers.  
Of other themes be mine the song  
When days are short, and days long  
And round the heart the merry throng  
Beguile the hours  
Then let the fire be trim and clear  
Within that little circle dear  
We’ll keep us warm  
With us the Muse shall sit and sing,  
And love perchance may stoop his wing  
Our hearths to charm  
Then open soon the *Attic Pie*  
That some may sing and *all* may try  
Do you not hear us doleful cry  
“We can’t get out”  
Oh give us liberty and light  
And we will cheer each Attic Night  
With sweetest song — ere yet our flight  
*We think about*.  
In hope that you will grant our pray’rs  
We, late inhabitants of air  
Wish health to every married fair  
Of Attic Line.  
And *every* single beau and belle  
In sooth we wish them quite as well  
Though *Jenny Wren* some tales will tell  
Next Valentine!
