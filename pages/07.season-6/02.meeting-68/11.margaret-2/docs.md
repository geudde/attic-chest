Yet, Margret bids those numbers flow  
Which erst delighted every ear,  
She cannot those sweet sounds forego  
She cannot *part* with song so dear!  

And should the minstrel’s tell-tale lyre  
Prove echo to a faithful heart  
Love may his Margret too inspire  
With skill to sing a second part!  

For yet, my friend, her promised hand  
Wears not the little golden spell  
The potent talismanic band  
Which only with true love should dwell.  

And tho’ yon pow’rful gloomy lord  
Hath sought to win her for his bride  
His wooing was with fire and sword  
And foray on the border side!  

And here the simple truth to tell  
She has no heart for such a man.  
Would Allan bring that “golden spell”  
She’d brave Dunkeld, and all his clan!  

P.S.

Then if thou *wilt* the myrtle wear,  
If love *must* breathe in every line  
E’en sing the praises of thy fair  
But Allan — let that praise be mine! 

Margaret
