##### Translated for the Attic Chest

Kind Dove, thy silver wings expand,  
Return and greet thy Master’s hand;  
Thy beak in purple nectar dip  
And add its richness to his lip; —   
But tell him in a distant day  
Thy wings shall waft his purest lay  
Far as the West’s elysian isle  
To win an attic fair one’s smile;  
And Friendship from his honied vine  
Shall steal a leaf for <span class="small">ELLEN</span>’s shrine.

Wait, faithful bird, and watch the hour  
When kindred Muses throng her bow’r;  
Then round the hallow’d tapers skim,  
And hover on her goblet’s brim:  
There gently sip, and seek no more  
The Teian grape’s ambrosial store;  
A purer draught her goblet fills  
From rich Castalia’s lucid rills:  
But make her sacred chest thy care —   
Thy master’s attic lyre is there!
