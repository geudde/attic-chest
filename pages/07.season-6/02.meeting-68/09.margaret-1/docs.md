The enclosed copies of *authentic papers* are sent to the Attic Chest in consequence of the information conveyed from “Positive House” concerning that too amiable Protheus *”Beauclere”* — if that gentleman has really forgotten *Castle Gowrie* with all its relative circumstances these verses will recall to the recollection of “Allan” the

No more the castle’s spacious hall  
Resounds with Allan’s tuneful song,  
No more his harp’s enchanting call  
Brings youth, and age, to join the throng.  

Resume my friend thy wonted fire  
Thy native cheerfulness and glee  
Oh! take thy long neglected lyre  
And strike the notes so gay and free.  

Arouse thee Allan from thy dream,  
And charm again the listening ear,  
But touch not that unwelcome theme  
My plighted faith forbids to hear!  

But rather ‘twine the lasting wreath  
The Muse delights to give the brave,  
That cheers the dying victor’s death,  
And strews the laurel o’er his grave.  

But if thou *wilt* the myrtle wear,  
If love *must* breathe in every line  
Then sing the praises of thy fair  
But do not let that praise be mine!
