<div class="author">Mr Porden</div>

Three cups of wine a moderate man may take  
The first of these for constitution’s sake  
The second to the girl he loves the best  
The third and last to lull him to his rest  
Then home to bed but if a fourth he pours  
’Twill be the cup of folly and not ours  
Loud noisy talking on the fifth attends  
The sixth breeds feuds and falling out of friends  
Seven beget blows and faces stained with gore  
Eight and the watch patrol breaks ope the door  
Mad with the ninth another cup goes round  
And the swill’d *sot drops* senseless on the ground
