Ah! cruel Margaret why require  
That I should strike again the lyre,  
Do’st thou not know forgetful maid  
That if my hand thy will obeyed  
I might thy anger move!  
What theme but *one*, could Allan sing!  
And what could each responsive string  
But answer, notes of love!  
Then spare the secret of my woe,  
Nor bid thy trembling minstrel show  
The anguish he must prove.  

Allan
