#### Nine lines by way of Apology for not writing eight.  
  
Oh! if from tuneful Laura’s hand  
Had fall’n the little truant band,  
&emsp;Or Myra’s golden chain,  
The subject would the verse inspire,  
Some Bard might then have seized the Lyre,  
&emsp;And waked the vocal strain!  
But she to whom no charms belong  
Has little claim to Poets song  
&emsp;Her Brac’let strays in vain!
