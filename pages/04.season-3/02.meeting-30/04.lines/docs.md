<span class="title">Nine lines by way of Apology for not writing eight.  </span>
  
Oh! if from tuneful Laura’s hand  
Had fall’n the little truant band,  
&emsp;Or Myra’s golden chain,  
The subject would the verse inspire,  
Some bard might then have seized the lyre,  
&emsp;And waked the vocal strain!  
But she to whom no charms belong  
Has little claim to poets song  
&emsp;Her brac’let strays in vain!  
  
M.F.
