#### The Old Philosophical Enigma Unriddled

It is a Stone, and yet a Stone ‘tis not,
In which the all of Art consists, I wot,
In Nature’s hand though never perfect seen
Yet perfect is in *Potency*, I ween,
Search not on Earth, for there you’ll find it not
In Vulcan’s Caves ’tis only found, I wot,
Of the whole Art *it* is the *Golden Mean*,
Seek then what we a *Vapour* call; I ween,
For a live Animal, mistake it not
And yet, a red devouring Lion ’tis, I wot,
In form of *flying Mercury*, oft tis seen
And yet, no vulgar Mercury ’tis I ween;
For *Pure* and *Clear*; yet ponderous it is not,
Unlike the Common *Argent Vive*, I wot,
Some Wits in sport y’clept it *Lion Green*
Just so, as like a blue-dog ’tis, I ween,
For Herb, or Brute, or Bird, be sure ’tis not,
A *Mineral, cum grano Salis*, ’tis, I wot,
By Heat, by Light, and *Air*, condens’d ’tis seen
Transparent, clear, and *Aqueous* I ween,
And yet tho’ moist, ’tis dry; tho’ Cold, ’tis hot;
An Elemental perfect Com-pound ’tis, I wot
By Fire extract its *Sulphur*, which when seen
You’re Master both of *Nature* & of *Art*, I ween
Tho’ quaint Expressions, in these lines are seen
Reject them not, for Truth’s within, I ween
For it thou dost, thou are a very Sot,
And a *Foolsopher* will remain I wot.
