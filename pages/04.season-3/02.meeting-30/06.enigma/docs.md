<span class="title">The Old Philosophical Enigma Unriddled</span>

It is a stone, and yet a stone ’tis not,<br>
In which the all of art consists, I wot,<br>
In nature’s hand though never perfect seen<br>
Yet perfect is in *potency*, I ween,<br>
Search not on earth, for there you’ll find it not<br>
In Vulcan’s caves ’tis only found, I wot,<br>
Of the whole art *it* is the *golden mean*,<br>
Seek then what we a *vapour* call; I ween,<br>
For a live animal, mistake it not<br>
And yet, a red devouring lion ’tis, I wot,<br>
In form of *flying mercury*, oft tis seen<br>
And yet, no vulgar mercury ’tis I ween;<br>
For *pure* and *clear*; yet ponderous it is not,<br>
Unlike the common *argent vive*, I wot,<br>
Some wits in sport y’clept it *lion green*
Just so, as like a blue-dog ’tis, I ween,<br>
For herb, or brute, or bird, be sure ’tis not,<br>
A *mineral, cum grano salis*, ’tis, I wot,<br>
By heat, by light, and *air*, condens’d ’tis seen<br>
Transparent, clear, and *aqueous* I ween,<br>
And yet tho’ moist, ’tis dry; tho’ cold, ’tis hot;<br>
An elemental perfect com-pound ’tis, I wot<br>
By fire extract its *sulphur*, which when seen<br>
You’re master both of *nature* & of *art*, I ween<br>
Tho’ quaint expressions, in these lines are seen<br>
Reject them not, for truth’s within, I ween<br>
For it thou dost, thou are a very sot,<br>
And a *foolsopher* will remain I wot.
