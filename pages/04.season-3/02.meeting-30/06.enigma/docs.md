#### The Old Philosophical Enigma Unriddled

It is a stone, and yet a stone ’tis not,
In which the all of art consists, I wot,
In nature’s hand though never perfect seen
Yet perfect is in *potency*, I ween,
Search not on earth, for there you’ll find it not
In Vulcan’s caves ’tis only found, I wot,
Of the whole art *it* is the *golden mean*,
Seek then what we a *vapour* call; I ween,
For a live animal, mistake it not
And yet, a red devouring lion ’tis, I wot,
In form of *flying mercury*, oft tis seen
And yet, no vulgar mercury ’tis I ween;
For *pure* and *clear*; yet ponderous it is not,
Unlike the common *argent vive*, I wot,
Some wits in sport y’clept it *lion green*
Just so, as like a blue-dog ’tis, I ween,
For herb, or brute, or bird, be sure ’tis not,
A *mineral, cum grano salis*, ’tis, I wot,
By heat, by light, and *air*, condens’d ’tis seen
Transparent, clear, and *aqueous* I ween,
And yet tho’ moist, ’tis dry; tho’ cold, ’tis hot;
An elemental perfect com-pound ’tis, I wot
By fire extract its *sulphur*, which when seen
You’re master both of *nature* & of *art*, I ween
Tho’ quaint expressions, in these lines are seen
Reject them not, for truth’s within, I ween
For it thou dost, thou are a very sot,
And a *foolsopher* will remain I wot.
