#### Song to the Air of “Waly, Waly, Love is bonnie”

Sae heavy is this waefu’ heart,  
Wi’ stifled sighs it soon mun break!  
To nane, I may its grief impart  
To nane, its dool and anguish speak.  
  
The saut, saut tears that thrang my E’e  
I dare na’, dare na’, let them fa’,  
I wad I might lay down an’ dee  
And quat the warl its cares and a’!  
  
I saw a Bird upon a breer,  
He pip’d an’ sang wi mickle glee,  
But soon he flew, that sonsie Bird!  
It was na’ lang he pip’d to me!  
  
I saw a Rose upon a bush,  
A bonnier Rose might nae be seen,  
I gather’d it at morning’s blush,  
But Ah! it wither’d e’er the E’en!  
  
The sin’ my hopes are blighted a’,  
Like blossoms fallen frae the tree,  
And ilka joy has wing’d awa’,  
I fain wad lay me down and dee!
