<div class="author">Miss Flaxman</div>

My first was by an ancient poet sung,  
Tremendous weapon, which was frequent hung,  
At awful distance, while with look askance,  
The youthful eye has cast a fearful glance.  
&emsp;My next a weapon of a different kind  
Most potent in a skilful hand you find;  
Can wound or cure, can order and obey,  
Can flatter princes, or can maids betray.  
Tis love’s prime minister, or lawyer’s friend  
Can cause a quarrel, or a quarrel end.  
A wise man’s weapon, tho’ a goose may use it,  
And woe to him who ever dares abuse it.  
For if he does — why let him dread the worst,  
Misuse my second, he’ll deserve my first.  
&emsp;Now gentle ladies, when you’re quite at leisure  
Transpose the letters, at your will and pleasure.  
Arranged in order you will find a name  
That’s dear to friendship, not unknown to fame
