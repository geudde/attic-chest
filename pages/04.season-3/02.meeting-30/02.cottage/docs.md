Ah! may the Gods ordain our lot  
Beneath some little rush-roof’d cot,  
&emsp;Far off from noisy town  
Releas’d from fashion’s idle care  
A plain mob cap I’ll only wear  
&emsp;And linsy woolsy gown.  
  
Not Fowl — nor Fish — not Butchers meat  
Shall ere pollute our sylvan seat  
&emsp;With bloody slaughter cruel,  
But Lettuce — Cress — and Peppermint  
Our light repast will never stint  
&emsp;Nor frugal water gruel.  
  
Beside some streamlets rushy brink  
Together we will sit and think,  
But on no useful matter  
To Fortune we will leave the care  
To wash and comb the children’s hair  
And fill their empty platter.  
  
Thus undisturb’d our days shall pass  
Beneath the bough and on the grass  
When write on our Grave-stone  
Here lies a Pair that never thought  
No begg’d — nor borrow’d — stole — nor wrought  
Content with Love alone!
