### Or, The Brighton Fracas. A Tale  
  
Daughters of Albion, lend an ear  
&emsp;While an unvarnished tale I tell  
Of Mischief foiled by guilty fear  
&emsp;And strange events that late befell.  
  
Nor you, my Attic Audience deem  
&emsp;That idle fancy framed the story,  
Of two brave Youths that grace my theme  
&emsp;One sits with downcast eyes before ye.  
  
Now Sirius raged — to every part  
&emsp;From London Beaux and Belles repair  
With all the sons of trade and art  
&emsp;To taste the purer Ocean-air.  
  
With these a Lawyer high in station  
&emsp;Fatigued with Probits, Briefs and cases  
Rode forth to spend the long vacation  
&emsp;At Brighton, prime of watering places.  
  
Arrived in search of Board and Bed  
&emsp;He through the streets and alleys strayed  
Till by his evil Genius led  
&emsp;He fixed on the Marine Parade.  
  
For there was many a Knight and Squire  
&emsp;And Damsel gay, and courtly dame;  
And there, to set the Steyne on fire  
&emsp;The lovely young Emilia came.  
  
In prime of health in Beauty’s bloom,  
&emsp;Opprest with fancied pain and grief  
She hoped the scene might chase the gloom,  
&emsp;And yield her various woes relief.  
  
So soft her soul, the tender fair  
&emsp;With anguish viewed a drowning fly  
Nor could the thought her bosom bear  
&emsp;That pretty Pig or Lamb should die.  
  
And if a Spider chanced to roam  
&emsp;Her fits the pitying guests surprise  
And if a Mouse forsake its home  
&emsp;She fills the ambient air with cries.  
  
But when the angry thunder rolled  
&emsp;And vivid flashed the Lightning blue  
Her shrieks repeated scared the bold  
&emsp;So loud and shrill her clamours grew.  
  
Soon through her terror and her tears  
&emsp;The Lawyer saw the Damsel’s arts  
That all her grief and causeless fears  
&emsp;Were snares to catch unwary hearts.  
  
And pondering in his crafty thought,  
&emsp;Deep schemes to tease the wretched maid  
A youthful Officer he sought  
&emsp;With wicked speed, his plots to aid.  
  
Not Ladies think my Tale untrue  
&emsp;That foremost here the Lawyer shone  
For Lawyers (let them have their due)  
&emsp;Have ever been to mischief prone  
  
Their plan arranged, the Lawyer buys  
&emsp;A Phial of Phosphoric fire  
While to the stores, the Soldier hies  
&emsp;For hissing squibs and crackers dire.  
  
With these the gallant pair designs  
&emsp;At night the Maiden to appall,  
With dreadful prophecies, in lines  
&emsp;Of lambent flame upon the wall.  
  
And when chill fear had seized her soul  
&emsp;The more her senses to astound  
To bid the mimic thunder roll  
&emsp;And nitrous lightnings stream around.  
  
But mark the end, her guardian sprite  
&emsp;Decreed their dreadful scheme to spoil,  
And that the danger, shame, and fright  
&emsp;Should on their caitiff heads recoil.  
  
For creeping slow, in conscious fear  
&emsp;As up the stairs the Lawyer goes  
He thinks approaching footsteps near  
&emsp;And starting, down the Bottle throws.  
  
The Phial breaks, aghast he stands  
&emsp;Bereft of speech, in wild amaze  
As o’er the carpet swift expands  
&emsp;With fumes of noisome stench, the blaze  
  
Meanwhile the Soldier onward came,  
&emsp;His pockets with combustion fraught,  
Unconscious of the spreading flame  
&emsp;Which soon his igneous cargo caught.  
  
Bounce goes one pocket — Bounce the other —  
&emsp;In terror down the Soldier falls,  
The fumes the Caitiffs nearly smother  
&emsp;And fear each guilty soul appalls.  
  
Fie Soldier fie — if in such fright  
&emsp;At noise how great had been your dread,  
If in the jeopardy of fight  
&emsp;The balls had whizzed around your head.  
  
Rise, valiant Soldier rise, nor mind  
&emsp;Your newest regimentals spoiled,  
It is a common cause to find  
&emsp;A man at his own weapons foiled.  
  
“Fire,” cries the Lawyer, “Water, Fire.”  
&emsp;And “Fire” the fallen soldier cries,  
“Help, or in flames I shall expire,”  
&emsp;He said, but never strove to rise.  
  
Now from th’ adjacent rooms, a rout  
&emsp;Of men and maids, and Matrons fly,  
“Fire, Water, Fire,” the Ladies shout,  
&emsp;“Fire, Water, Fire,” the Knights reply.  
  
The young, the old, the fat, the lean,  
&emsp;Half-drest, half naked ran, and one  
Brave chief who’d hotter service seen  
&emsp;Without his leg came hopping on.  
  
Meanwhile the Hostess well aware,  
&emsp;Her chairs and stools were uninsured  
Flew swiftly down the Kitchen stair  
&emsp;And there a full fraught tub secured.  
  
In that same Vessel, just before  
&emsp;The Cook had cleaned her savoury dishes  
And in solution now it bore,  
&emsp;The scraps of Flesh, and Fowls, and Fishes.  
  
Half sinking with the weight she came,  
&emsp;And struggling thro’ the motley crew —  
She on the Soldier, and the flame  
&emsp;The tub and turbid water threw.  
  
He cried, “I’m drowned, fried, roasted, boiled,”  
&emsp;Which death the hero thought the worst  
I know not, tho’ by Phosphorus broiled  
&emsp;I think he better liked the first.  
  
Nor on the prostrate son of Mars  
&emsp;Alone the greasy deluge fell  
For thanks to his good-natured stars  
&emsp;It all the Lawyer drenched as well.  
  
And dripping wet, a woeful sight  
&emsp;Like to the grisly fiend he stands  
That scares had Boys at dead of night  
&emsp;All smudged and scorched his face and hands.  
  
And now extinguished is the fire  
&emsp;And joy succeeds to wild dismay  
And while its author all enquire  
&emsp;His guilty looks the wretch betray.  
  
With many a keen sarcastic sneer  
&emsp;His case the motley circle mourn  
And men and maids delighted hear  
&emsp;The Lawyer roasted in his turn.  
   
And now the culprit more to vex  
The Hostess presses thro’ the crowd  
His suppliant mien she little recks  
But talks of *damages* aloud.  
  
Constrained by Fear and Shame to yield  
And eke to save his eyes and head  
He plights his word, and from the field  
The Guests again retire to bed.  
  
But how, amid the wondrous coil  
Did lovely young Emilia fare  
Did she not “wail and weep the while”  
And “fill with cried the ambient air.”  
  
Ah no, mid real ills the maid  
Forgot the gracefull *Art* of *Woe*  
And where the boldest were afraid  
No fear uncommon seem’d to know.
