##### In honour of a Knight and a King’s fair Daughter

<span class="pencil">Sir John Carr &amp; Miss *King*</span>

Come Oh all ye little Loves!  
Presiding over cake and gloves,  
Waft me on thy downy pinions  
To Cytheroea’s sweet dominions,  
Lay me on a bank of roses,  
Where the queen thy mother dozes,  
Then a quill I pray you steal  
From the winged Hermes heel.  
My ink must be Pactolus’ stream  
No meaner ink would suit the theme  
Would great Apollo lend his lyre  
And just for once my hand inspire  
Then might I write an epitha —   
 — lamium worthy of the day,  
Then might I in high sounding verse  
And strains divine my song rehearse  
In honour of the knight I’d sing  
Who weds the daughter of a king!

The errant knight so brave of old,  
As chronicles have gravely told  
After long rambling here and there,  
Now up, now down, for many a year,  
When many a Paynim foul he’d beaten,  
And nearly ’scaped being killed and eaten!  
When giants lay on field for dead,  
When fiery dragons all were fled,  
When he’d no griffon left to ride on,  
Or magic steed that he could bide on,  
Returned he then with armour battered  
Sir Knight perhaps a little shattered

Be sure to find the constant fair,  
Both knight and armour to repair,  
And each when riveted with gold  
Would many a tough encounter hold.

But ye have flown, ye little Loves!
With all the cake, and all the gloves!
Ye’ve left me here to go at random  
Just like a what? Why like a tandem!
And should I chance to go astray  
Or should my leader run away  
Could I, unskillful hope to shun  
The fate of rash Sir Phoebus’ son  
Who four in hand, would fain be *prime*  
Like heroes of the present time!  
Losing a linch-pin, down he came!  
Mark this ye whips and fear the same  
For truly if ye do not alter,  
Each whip-chord may become a halter!

So, now I’ve had my frolic out  
Methinks I’ll gravely turn about,  
Like tired nag, who seeks the stable  
Or like the moral of a fable.

Long may the knight whom now I sing  
Who weds the daughter of a king,  
Sail smoothly down the stream of life  
Nor touch upon the shores of strife,  
Hope at the helm, his course to guide  
Good humour smiling by his side,  
Of all his voyages confessed,  
This *last* the pleasantest, the best!
