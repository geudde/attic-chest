Nestling on the barren cliff  
See the monarch of the skies;  
Mark him meet the opening day  
And full upon its radiance rise.

Not among the painted train  
Learnt he along the grove to float;  
Nor yet among the warbling choirs  
He learnt to tune one tender note.  

But proudly with an unfledged wing  
He pierced the cloud where thunders sleep;  
And screaming on the northern wind  
He chased the lightning o’er the deep.

Like him ye youths who from the plain  
Dare air the level lift your eye  
Rouse the rough vigour of your soul  
Let fee each nobler passion fly.

But ah! beware each soft’ning art  
Each charming tenderness beware.  
Ah! shun the smiling siren Love  
Not listen to her soothing air.

Not yours — unhappy! — is the heart  
All form’d in loving harmony,  
Whose slightest springs angelic wove  
In keen susceptibility.

Not yours, to know these finer joys  
That those of happier fortune know  
Nor softly sympathetic mourn  
In all the elegance of woe.

He hardly drags th’unequal load  
Through the rough vale of adverse life  
With unscarred feet, that treads the thorn  
With gentle heart to bear its strife.  

To meet the shock of fate be yours  
And rear aloft th’unatten’d brow;  
Though thunders shake the rending earth  
And towns and regal towers are low.
