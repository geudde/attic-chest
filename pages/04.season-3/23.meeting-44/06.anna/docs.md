<div class="author">Miss Flaxman</div>

In every bower, in every mead,  
&emsp;In each sequestered shady spot,  
I seek for Anna, dearest maid,  
&emsp;The flower that says, “Forget me not.”

But I the search in vain pursue,  
&emsp;By fountain clear, or mossy grot,  
With golden eye, and circle blue,  
&emsp;The flower that says, “Forget me not.”

But though the little vagrant flower,  
&emsp;To find, it may not be my lot,  
Still memory shall assert her power,  
&emsp;And whisper soft, “Forget me not.”

Myra

August 9th 1810
