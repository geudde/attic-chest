##### A Sonnet Written in the Favorite Chair of Dean Swift

Here seated — erstwhere Swift, oft musing sat  
&emsp;And formed his Gulliver’s immortal tale,  
Or entertained his friends in witty chat  
&emsp;Or bade sublimer topics to prevail.

Here seated — deep reflection takes her range,  
&emsp;And contemplates the altering hand of time,  
With retrospective eye masks every change  
&emsp;Since Swift here wrote his prose or sportive rhyme.  

Here seated — while enamoured memory dwells  
&emsp;On Genius — Talent — Learning most profound,  
With mortified regret the bosom swells  
&emsp;And proud humanity receives a wound.  

That Swift endowed with gifts the wisest crave  
Should sink a senseless madman to the grave.

Swift’s mind was violently deranged for some time previous to his death.
