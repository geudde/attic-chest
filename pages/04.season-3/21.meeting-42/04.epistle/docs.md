O! think not Maria, while distant I prowl  
&emsp;That I bear thee no longer in mind  
Not such is the make of thy Father’s fond soul  
Which since he possess’d it, has known no control  
&emsp;But feelings all tender and kind.

There’s magic Maria in *names* that we prize  
&emsp;And the sound of some letters alone  
Will throb in the bosom and stream in the eye,  
As *memory* events that are long-lost supplies  
&emsp;And scenes that for ever are flown.

Such, such is thy name dear Maria to me  
&emsp;For early in life, e’er its woes  
Had bruis’d and assailed this susceptible heart  
She who bore it, occasion’d its every smart  
&emsp;And made or destroyed its repose.

She taught me affection, and friendship, and love  
&emsp;And gave to my bosom a charm  
It raised me each selfish sensation above  
(For in truth she was tender and soft as the dove)  
&emsp;And led me from error and harm.

All heaven was in this! but it spoilt me, my dear  
&emsp;And made me unfit for this earth,  
For my passions were ardent, were true and sincere  
And I loved far, far more sensibility’s tear  
&emsp;Than splendour and riches, and mirth.

Thus app’d, as life had commenced its bright day  
With Maria was coupled each joy;  
To my every happiness she led the way  
Without her, e’en *Nature* herself look’d not gay  
And with her there was not alloy.

Say then my loved girl bearing this dearest name  
My daughter, my boast and my pride  
To my comfort thus link’d, to my joy and my fame  
How *doubly* thou hast to my bosom a claim  
Thus by sympathy fondly allied.

At this moment O! how would thy presence delight  
While on Freedown’s delicious assent  
The gay coast of Gallia gladdens the sight  
And boldly the Fareland extends to the sight  
To the left, all the beauties of Kent.

Below in the Downs a forest behold  
Of ships, from each climate and land  
While alternately tinged with azure and gold  
The Channel rolls sparkling, extensive and bold  

And the spreading sail glides ’long the strand.  
The sun is declining, the glad shepherd boy   
To the valley is driving his sheep  
To pen them secure from attack or annoy  
And around us is heard the cricketer’s joy  
As skillful their stations they keep.

At a distance beneath, the spire ’bove the  
And the farm at the bottom appear
