<div class="author">Miss Porden</div>

  
I know that Sages gravely say  
&emsp;Love quenches reason’s fire  
That he is blind, and ill-matched hearts  
&emsp;At random does inspire.  

Then is it blind what’s excellent  
&emsp;With fervour to <span data-tippy="inspire" class="green">admire</span>   
When kindled by a maid like thee  
&emsp;Love is a noble fire  

Who could resist the dart of Love  
&emsp;From eyes so bright as thine  
Who is there, would not wish to prove  
&emsp;Thy favoured Valentine
