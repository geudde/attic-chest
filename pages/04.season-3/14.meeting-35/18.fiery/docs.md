In Poets, all my Marks you’ll see,  
&emsp;Since Flash & Smoke reveal me;  
Suspect me always near *Nat Lee*  
&emsp;E’en *Blackmore* can’t conceal me.  

In *Milton’s* Page I glow by art,  
&emsp;One Flame intense and even;  
In *Shakespear’s* blaze! a sudden start,  
&emsp;Like Lightnings flash’d from Heaven.  

In many more, as well as they  
&emsp;Thro’ various forms I shift;  
I’m gently lambent when I’m *Gay*,  
&emsp;But brightest where I’m *Swift*.  

From Smoke shure Tidings you may get,  
&emsp;It can’t subsist without me;  
Or find me, like some fond Coquette,  
&emsp;With fifty *Sparks* about me.  

In other forms I oft am seen,  
&emsp;In breast of *Young* and *Fair*;  
And as the *Virtues* dwell within,  
&emsp;You’ll always find me there.  
 
I wish pure piercing, brilliant Gleams  
&emsp;Can arm *Eliza’s* Eye!  
With modest, soft, ethereal beams  
&emsp;Sweet *Mary’s* I supply!!
