Oh that my dearest Moth could know  
&emsp;The bounds of Stella’s love  
Her jealousies she would forego  
&emsp;If Stella chanced to rove.  

But dearest Moth forgets, ’tis plain  
&emsp;How lately she was seen  
Flitting thro’ Richmond’s pleasant lane  
&emsp;And over Richmond Green.  

For Stella knew her Moth so sly  
&emsp;Was going to take a flight  
She therefore mounted to the sky  
&emsp;Among her kindred bright.  

Close by the moon her station lay  
&emsp;With Phoebus she was vying  
To make the Night shine clear as day  
&emsp;While pretty Moth was flying.  
 
For Moth is still her Stella’s care  
&emsp;Whether in Earth or Sky,  
Above she lights her as a Star  
&emsp;On Earth, as brilliant fly.  

And thus she’ll guide her Moth from harm  
&emsp;With all her powers of Sights  
’Gainst every evil find a charm  

Stella
