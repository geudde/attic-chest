##### To Plumina, or the Mistaken Fair One  
  
In Plato’s time while sages pour  
The sacred philosophic lore,  
To illustrate the Ideal line  
Zeuxis give the form divine,  
This mental light no longer given,  
Fair Painting’s charms return to Heaven.  
  
But Homer’s feats, his deeds of Arms,  
His wily crafts, and dread alarms,  
Impieties, and Murderous plan,  
Live in the evil heart of Man.
