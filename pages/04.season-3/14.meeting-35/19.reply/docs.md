#### To “Say Love what master shews thy art”  
  
Let other paint Eliza’s charms,  
&emsp;With all the art that Love inspires  
And swear, the flame their breast that warms  
&emsp;Is more intense than Etna’s first.  
  
Let them declare Pieria’s Maids  
&emsp;“Attempt Love’s envied song in vain”  
Who taught mid Pindus’ sacred shade  
&emsp;The wanton Boy his noblest strain.  
  
Till taught by them, his highest aim  
&emsp;Adore, at most a Shepherd’s heart,  
The muses found him better game  
&emsp;In Gods and Heroes fix’d his dart.  

Then Love assumed a nobler form,  
&emsp;And with an added radiance shone,  
His fire the purest breast might warm,  
&emsp;E’en blushing maids his darts might own.  
  
  
But circled now with other rays,  
&emsp;His form degraded we behold;  
He lives but in the Muses’ lays,  
&emsp;Or in the sacred thirst for gold.  
  
In lofty Homer’s softer strain,  
&emsp;Love join’d with constancy we view,  
But Ah! on earth we seek in vain,  
&emsp;We cannot find the picture true.  
  
We, in those times, with truth suppose  
&emsp;Who loved the most would sing the best,  
But now we find his pains, by those,  
&emsp;Who never felt the smart exprest.  
  
And as they range from fair to fair,  
&emsp;Of each with equal warmth they sing,  
Now Mary’s face, now Harriet’s air,  
&emsp;Eliza’s eyes now wake the string.  
  
With their ephemeral sovereign they  
&emsp;No rival can in charms admit  
They’re all that’s lovely for a day  
&emsp;But lose their charms the next new fit.  
  
The butterflies on silken wing  
&emsp;Thus fluttering through the garden roam  
And rest on all the flowers of spring  
&emsp;But nowhere find a real *home*.
