Ah cruel Stella! wherefore take thy flight  
So far beyond the reach of mortal sight?  
Mid Worlds innumerous and thro’ boundless space  
Some new-found Planet’s wond’rous course to trace.  
In vain alas! my feeble wings essayed  
To follow thee, my dear aspiring Maid,  
But soaring Genius bore thee from my view  
To Realms where I must never dare pursue!  
Too great the dangers for a Moth to brave,  
Not Stella’s self, could from a Comet save!  
Deserted, lost, I shun the noon-tide ray,  
And sigh ’till Hesper brings the Lovers day,  
Then watch the glancing Meteors on the stream  
And fancy Stella’s image in each gleam.  

Return erratic Maid, nor longer roam,  
Contented shine, the bright *fixed star* of *Home!*

The forsaken

*Moth*
