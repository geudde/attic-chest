In Law it long has been enacted  
For benefit of deeds transacted,  
If to a nuisance you repair,  
The nuisance may continue there  
But if you you the nuisance came  
By Law, you might dislodge the same  
&emsp;Hence I declare, to bid me budge  
The Pencil’s claim is nought but fudge  
While I, from long possession’s right,  
Might turn it out of window quite.  
  
And sure my qualities would claim  
A larger share of well-earned game  
In all his Glory, Homer lives  
While Zeuxis scarce in name survives  
&emsp;But as I’m a good-natured pinion  
I will allow a joint dominion  
And when I feel to rest inclined  
The Pencil may relieve the mind.
