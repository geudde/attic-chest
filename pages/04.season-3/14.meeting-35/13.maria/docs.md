##### On the Expiration of the Mourning

Long in sable vest appearing  
Albion’s Nymphs Amelia mourned,  
This sweet morn their sorrows cheering  
Views in gayer robes adorned  
  
Each in gaudy hues arraying  
Strives her rivals to outshine  
Each her sweetest smiles displaying  
Hails the morn of Valentine.  
  
But o’er all superior shining  
Fair Maria claims my love,  
But my humble suit declining  
Naught her flinty heart can move.  
  
Yet in robe of white adorning  
May it prove her bridal vest!  
With her own may end my mourning  
And this day behold me blest.  
  
Constantius
