##### To the Priestess of the Attic Chest or Euphrosyne

Once more a voice demands from friendship’s shrine  
The yearly tribute to my Valentine.  
But now a recreant from the Muses’ train  
My hands would strive to tune the lyre in vain;  
Now all unskilled to court the opening spring  
Or seek fresh fragrance from the Zephyr’s wing  
To mark where dewdrops on the lily rise  
Whose beauteous bosom with the sunbeam vies;  
To praise the cheek where varying roses bloom  
Or brilliant lips whence Sylphids kiss perfume  
To praise the locks where thousand graces play,  
Where the Loves lurk and o’er our hearts hold sway;  
How can I dare to paint my Valentine  
When various beauties, various talents join  
Where I behold “the purple light of youth”,  
Led by fair candour, loveliest child of Truth  
 Let then these wishes for my fault alone,  
Ah! let them make my warm affection known.  
May the best Muse on Thee her influence shed  
And twine her favourite bay branch round thy head;  
May distant times with transport hear thy song  
And Fame in distant climes thy praise prolong  
May health encircled by unnumbered years  
Attend on thee unstained by grief or tears.  
  
Still may Simplicity they steps attend  
Thy sweet companion, monitor and friend.  
Long in that circle where thy polished lays  
Have shone resplendent with superior blaze  
Long mayst thou reign unrivalled in esteem  
Long for our joy may thy good humour beam  
And there where no wit sarcastic dares intrude  
Long mayst thou bind our hearts in charms of gratitude
