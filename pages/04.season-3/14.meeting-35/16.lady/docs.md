##### Thanking the Author for a Valentine

&emsp;In Chivalry’s resplendent age  
When Knights with Dragons did engage  
When Giants huge did haunt each land  
When Magic spread her sable wand  
And bade each day at fall of Night  
Some castle meet the hero’s sight,  
Which on the morn would fade away  
As tho’ dissolved by Phoebus ray.  
&emsp;Each hero then, his country’s boast,  
Singly overcame an armed host,  
Or would thro’ magic gardens rove  
His courage and his skill to prove,  
And there some monstrous beast engage  
Emitting fire, whose furious rage  
Swift conquered by his arm should lie,  
The wonder of posterity.  
&emsp;In that famed age each valiant Knight  
Enamoured of some damsel bright  
Declared that from his mistress’ eyes  
Did every great achievement rise.  
Her favours gave him strength and might  
Her smiles new courage for the fight  
&emsp;So Mary did the opening charms inspire  
Thy faithful Henry, with poetic fire  
Who lately dared on Cupid’s favourite morn  
To lead your mind where arts the scene adorn  
No thanks to him you owe, but rather he  
For inspiration owes his thanks to thee  
But if for him you deem some guerdon meet,  
Allow him to renew a task so sweet  
Allow him each revealing year to shine  
This lovely Mary’s favoured Valentine  
  
Henry
