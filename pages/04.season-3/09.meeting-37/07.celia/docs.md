<div class="author">Miss Porden</div>

July 1809

The day was fine, the air was mild,  
The sun on hill and valley smiled  
The birds on wings of joy and love  
Flew frequent through the shady grove,  
The white, the red rose seemed to vie,  
For preference in the gazer’s eye  
The jasmine shed its sweet perfume,  
And opened wide its starry bloom,  
Around it flowers of brighter hue  
The fuchsia red, the larkspur blue  
And scented sweet, the flower the eyes  
Mistake for sportive butterflies,  
That roaming Flora’s dewy bower,  
Alternate perch on every flower,  
Their little lives in pleasure spend  
Nor lose a moment, lest it end.  
  
But many a day before I’ve seen  
As fresh the flowers, as bright the green,  
Why seem they more profusely gay,  
Why drest in brighter charms to-day,  
Is it because my Celia fair  
Will shortly to this spot repair,  
And that my soul on friendship’s wings  
To meet the maid exulting springs,  
For this, in brighter charms array’d  
They seem to hail the lovely maid,  
For this, a doubly sweet perfume  
Appears to shed their lavish bloom.
