Adieu! awhile to Attic strains  
Ilk Muse sublime! — and Muse diverting  
Dulness alone wi’ me remains  
Her sway o’er a’ my saul asserting.

How swiftly flew the cadgie hours  
When pleasure, wi’ guid sense uniting  
From Fancy call’d the sweetest flow’rs  
And ilk a Grace was so inviting.

Waes me! on these revolving days  
That aft my senses fill’d wi wonder  
Ise hear nae mair, these tunefu’ lays  
But grieve that wi sae lang maun sunder!

Oh time flee swift and bring again  
Those hours sae dear wi’ friendship glowing  
Enliven’d wi sweet music’s strain,  
Or Ellen’s numbers softly flowing.
