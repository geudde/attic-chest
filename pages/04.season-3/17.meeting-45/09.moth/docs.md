July 6th 1811

Hither with fleetest wing repair  
Ye sprites that rule the realms of air  
Whether in Phoebus radiance bright  
Ye weave your robes of varying light  
The Earth with smiles benignant cheer  
And clothe with fruits the opening year  
Or weep in soft ambrosial showers  
The balm that fills the fields with flowers  
Bid lightning flash and thunder roll  
Or fire with quivering lights the pole  
Oh come, to hail in festive lay,  
A sister Sylphid’s natal day.

When summer fires the sultry air  
For her your freshest gales prepare  
When winter’s cold benumbs the sense  
To her your kindly warmth dispense.  

Ye fays by gifted eyes oft seen  
To dance upon the moonlight green  
Near where some antique tower appears  
And frowns in all the pride of years  
Once thronged with knights and damsels fair  
Faithful in love, and bold in war  
Or near some neat tho’ lowly cot,  
Where past some bard his happy lot,  
Blest with the maid his soul held dear,  
And children like the morning fair,  
A cheerful heart, devoid of guile,  
And every Muse’s favouring smile.  
 
There still the aged laurel stands,  
Once planted by his youthful hands  
While the famed tree of Phoebus near  
Affection’s rose still blossoms fair —   
Then haste, to hail in festive lay,  
A sister fairy’s natal day.  

For her your finest, sweetest flowers,  
Bring from your never-fading bowers  
Of these a fragrant wreath compose,  
To twine around her smiling brows  
And when the lawn she deigned to tread  
Let flowers beneath her feet be spread  
And when she walks in Cynthia’s light  
Oh give your forms to bless her sight.

Ye Nine that on Parnassus brows,  
Your songs of deathless fame compose  
Or wander thro’ each sacred shade  
Where once your antient votaries strayed.  
And o’er the graves of those most dear,  
Still drop the soft embalming tear,  
(Lo, from those tears, of brightest dyes,  
Fresh flowers shall o’er their ashes rise.)  
Thence come, to hail in festive lay,  
A favoured votary’s natal day.

Oh still as wont, her song inspire,  
With all your soft Ætherial fire  
Tender yet sprightly, sweet and gay  
Still let it animate her lay.  
And with your smiles oh let me send,  
The ardent wishes of a friend,  
Of her who framed this artless lay,  
A sister sylph, a sister fay,  
A sister votary of the Nine,  
Let her each friendly wish combine,  
Which tho’ ’tis not recorded here  
Is not less lively, less sincere.  
And oh may dearest Moth approve,  
This trifling mark of Stella’s love.
