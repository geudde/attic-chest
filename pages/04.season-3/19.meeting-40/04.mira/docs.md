Each moment has its sickle, emulous  
Of time’s enormous scythe: each moment plays  
Its little weapon in the narrower sphere  
Of sweet domestic comfort, and cuts down  
The fairest bloom of sublunary bliss!

##### 1

’Twas the still hour of Vesper’s shining,  
 When Mira sought a rock’s retreat;  
Where cozy seaweeds hung entwining,  
 And wept salt tricklings at her feet.

##### 2

The wat’ry waste, heaven’s concave bounding,   
 ’Gan now with lashing foam to flow;   
The dusky twilight all surrounding,  
 Mourn’d sympathetic to her woe.
 
##### 3

Awhile in sullen silence musing,  
 She lay reflecting scenes behind:  
Till rost’ring thought grief’s rage arousing,  
 Thus sighed her sorrows to the wind.

“Ye clifted rocks with summits soaring,  
 That high o’erhand this sandy plain;  
Whence softer streams, in cat’racts roaring,  
 Conjoin the salt, cerulean main.

##### 5

“Within your wave-worn, lone recesses,  
 Entomb a grief-distracted maid;  
Where terror stalks with startling tresses  
 And darkness frowns a pitchy shade.

##### 6
“And thou, O deep! that hears’t my pining,  
 (The unvailing fume of frenzied breath)  
’Twas conscious *thou* and *fate* combining,  
 That vail’d my Damon’s eyes in death.
 
#####  7

“Him howling storms, of life divested,  
 Have made some hungry fishes prey;  
And from my eyes forever wrested,  
 On this side times short during day.
 
#####  8

“With lightning’s speed ev’n now I’ll follow  
  His shade beyond the reach of pain,  
Ev’n now the having surge I’ll hollow,  
  And press the bottom of the main.
 
##### 9

“So icy death, heaven’s awful envoy,  
 Long-wish’d, shall change my sick’ning state;  
And send a fear-form’d fleeting convoy,  
 And waft me to the realms of fate.”

She ceas’d — for night’s dark mantle spreading  
 Had sab’ly veil’d the vaulted sky:  
Nor social sound her sorrows heeding,  
 Save mocking echo made reply.

##### 11

Despair, her beauteous bosom rending,  
 Had now suffus’d hope’s glimm’ring ray  
When from the rude rock’s summit heading  
 She desp’rate plunged her headlong way.
