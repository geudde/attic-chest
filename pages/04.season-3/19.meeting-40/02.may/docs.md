Where is the smile, so light and gay,  
Once wont to gild the face of May,  
And where the flow’ry wreath that bound  
Her scented locks luxuriant round.

Now pale and wan the nymph appears,  
Her brilliant eyes are dimmed with tears.  
The flow’rets till her smiles command,  
Droop, nor their pearly blooms expand.

Not thus her faded charms were seen,  
When fair Emilia trod the green  
Her amber locks were all around  
With hyacinth and woodbine crowned.

The rose then opened on the scene  
And joyed to deck her blooming Queen  
Her looks were ever bright and gay,  
And poets loved to welcome May.

Say are the British nymphs less fair  
Than her who struck the Theban pair,  
Or have our youths less honour won  
Than Arcite, or than Palamon.

No, while our nymphs in mind and face  
Are fairest deemed of mortal race  
Historic records still proclaim  
Our youth the first in fields of fame.

The haste and dry each streaming tear  
Pale nature’s drooping spirit cheer,  
And with thy sweet enchanting smile  
Delight once more our happy Isle.
