The day draws near in which the Gnome  
Like fiend abhor’d, my veil conveyed  
Beneath the Earth to his dire home,  
And left me a deluded maid.  
But I’ll beseech some friendly squire  
To secure me from fate so dread  
Transplant the Gnome from Earth to fire  
And mix his ashes with the dead.  
Shall I beseech & sue in vain?  
Shall I be left his mate to be?  
Nor find one kind, one pitying swain?  
Forbid it love and gallantry!  
See from among the chosen few  
One knight steps forth the task to dare  
Nor shall that youth hereafter rue  
Such deed performed for maiden fair.  
When I possess the Magic Ring  
By this said valorous mortal given  
I’ll forfeit veil, or gown, or coat,  
Nor value finery a groat  
But think my lot is heaven.
