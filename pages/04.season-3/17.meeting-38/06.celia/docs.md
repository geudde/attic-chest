<div class="author">Miss Porden</div>  

To the rose, so wondrous fair,  
If my Celia I compare  
Scarce the flowrets glowing hue  
&emsp;Paints the blush that spreads her face.  
Scarce in its lovely forms we view  
&emsp;And emblem of her perfect grace,  
Scarce the fragrance of its smell  
Can her balmy breath excel.  
 
But ah what pity every rose  
Within should lurking thorns enclose  
That while its glowing hue we praise  
&emsp;And gently to our bosom press  
The lovely flower — with speed arrays  
&emsp;That fostering bosom to distress  
But say in Celia’s polished mind  
A lurking thorn where shall we find.  

Her yes, too mild to give a wound,  
Shed beams of love on all around  
Her heart in every virtue blest  
&emsp;Modest, affectionate and kind  
Would never wound another’s breast,  
&emsp;But strive to heal the wounded mind.  
But since a thorn I’m doomed to find  
Be to thy tongue that place assigned.  
 
Nor gentle Celia, let your voice  
Too hastily condemn my choice  
For when, on all your friends around  
&emsp;Of playful Wit you shower the darts  
Unknowning, oft, you give a wound  
&emsp;And pierce with sharpest thorn their hearts  
Yet pleasing e’en those wounds must prove  
From one whom all so dearly Love.
