What planetary form deceives my sight  
Whence thro’ the East breaks forth unusual light?  
Uranus cries “Saturn can’st thou unfold  
Who moves beyond? The twinkling Orb behold!  
The lucid speck a Planet’s aspect wears  
And lo! a seventh satellite appears”  
No Planet ever in that region known  
Or twinkling satellite thro’ ether shone”  
Saturn replied, “Of this I’m sure  
Yet optical deception may allure,  
And oft mislead the learned — let’s refer  
The subject to our Muse, who cannot err;  
The great Urania, shall her science prove  
And tell who dares presumptuously to rove.  
Tonight the Planets in assembled state,  
Th’opinion of high Jove in counsel wait;  
For each astonis’d has at Eve perceiv’d  
The luminary — and like us deceiv’d  
Perhaps by false appearance tinsel hue  
Almost believe the thing a planet true,  
And different climes with veneration own,  
A mighty world to Newton e’en unknown.  
In such discourse th’ethereal way they clear,  
Till Hermes tells the court of Jove they’re near;  
Dauntless they onward speed secure of fame,  
At least thus great Alcides gives his name;  
And now his satellites in homage wait  
Their Master’s exit from th’Olympian gate;  
The counsel meet when pure effulgent light  
Illumes the sable drapery of the night.  
Forth from Urania’s crest a radiant stream  
Unites with Luna’s chaste and silv’ry beam;  
That rest upon the stranger’s spangled vest  
Whose splendor fades by genuine lustre pressed.  
And as the circle the Impostor eyes,  
“What need we further proof?” Urania cries,  
“Presumptuous Meteor of electric flame  
Dar’st thou assume our noble Hero’s name,  
Whose valiant deeds recorded in the sky,  
In yonder starry constellation lie?  
Deceive no more our truth enquiring eyes  
As some new Planet of th’eastern skies —   
*Hence!* Where imagination — fiction’s free —   
*Utopia’s isle* is only worthy thee?  
Thy punishment be just, altho’ severe,  
Thro’ regions pass thou of the solar sphere;  
There melt thy dross in elemental heat,  
And learn that *genuine* worth is only great.”  
Astonish’d — speechless — no excuse he found,  
As hisses echoed thro’ the circle round;  
The mimic Planet glance indignant threw,  
As he in lost resplendency withdrew.  
Unwittingly the Muse must now relate,  
The sequel of her Hero’s direful fate;  
As solar regions he was journeying fast,  
A heated Comet flew eccentric past;  
With beaming tail the bold Impostor hurl’d  
A *Nebula* henceforth in unform’d world  
Of starry space unnotic’d ere to dwell,  
And thus unpitied false Alcides fell.
