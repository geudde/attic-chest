&emsp;&emsp;Says Mercury to Mars  
&emsp;&emsp;“Come prithee cease your Jars  
&emsp;&emsp;Let us have no more ado  
&emsp;&emsp;Or dearly we may rue  
&emsp;&emsp;See Jove with rage is big  
&emsp;&emsp;And shakes his amber wig  
Contention’s in vain I declare oh!  
&emsp;&emsp;A majority of votes  
&emsp;&emsp;My conquest sure denotes  
&emsp;&emsp;Constellations all incline  
&emsp;&emsp;To decide the Vict’ry mine  
&emsp;&emsp;I’ll ask the Lady Venus  
&emsp;&emsp;To make Harmony between us  
And Friendship eternal we’ll swear oh!”  
  
&emsp;&emsp;Mars quickly then replies  
&emsp;&emsp;Rage flashing from his eyes  
&emsp;&emsp;“Do you think I’m such an ass  
&emsp;&emsp;As to let this Matter pass  
&emsp;&emsp;No, having once possessed  
&emsp;&emsp;Pow’r supreme o’er the Chest  
No usurper shall reign I declare oh  
&emsp;&emsp;But as I feel assured  
&emsp;&emsp;Hermes ne’er will be endured  
&emsp;&emsp;I venture to suggest  
&emsp;&emsp;That the members of the Chest  
&emsp;&emsp;Shall decide as they think best  
&emsp;&emsp;And by their great Behest  
I’ll abide by the Styx, I swear oh!”  
  
&emsp;&emsp;And now behold the cause  
&emsp;&emsp;Submitted to the Laws  
&emsp;&emsp;Of the Members of the Chest  
&emsp;&emsp;Who flock from East to West  
&emsp;&emsp;Clever Counsel is engaged  
&emsp;&emsp;By the opponents enraged  
And stern is the Judge I declare oh.  
&emsp;&emsp;The pleadings are begun  
&emsp;&emsp;And, after some time, done  
&emsp;&emsp;Victor Mercury’s pronounced  
&emsp;&emsp;And Ares is renounced  
&emsp;&emsp;Thus Eloquence prevails  
&emsp;&emsp;When Slaughter’s power fails  
And War yields to Rhetoric I swear oh
