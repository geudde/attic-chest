Awake thou dormant mental fire  
My vagrant muse again inspire  
With Fancy’s happiest lay  
Away on swift poetic wing  
And from Parnassus hither bring  
Oblations for this day.

O day — thou record of my bliss  
Source of my wedded happiness  
To thee I’ll tribute pay  
Come Fancy with thy magic train  
With new creation fill my brain  
To celebrate this day.

Yet not to thy romantic power  
Can be ascribed the blissful hour  
Which now inspires my lay  
Fancy may paint, but truth alone  
Can show in character her own  
The joys that mark this day.

No treacherous words with specious sense  
Combin’d with flattery’s vile incense  
Does hallowed Truth display  
Her I invoke, to aid my verse  
To sanction what I now rehearse  
On this dear natal day.

May happy years unnumber’d pass  
E’er from Time’s monumental glass  
This day is lost forever  
When that’s ordained may the decree  
With its stern summons wait on me  
Then we no more shall sever.

E.C.
