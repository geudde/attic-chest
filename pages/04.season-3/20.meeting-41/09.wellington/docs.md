##### Extempore

To the Lady of Lavant (by the returning post) for her Annual Banquet on the 1st of May which is happily the birthday of Lord Wellington.

##### Recitative

Hail the day with festive mirth  
Honor’d by a hero’s birth!  
Arthur! worthy of the name,  
Long the boast of British fame!  
Truth may swear, by freedom’s lance,  
Thy exploits exceed romance —   

##### Air

Sing, Lusitania! lovely land!  
Now with thy brave deliverer glowing  
In joy that makes all hearts expand,  
His praise from every lip o’erflowing  
That hero is a Flower of May:  
Now hail the month in rapture’s measure,  
That opens with his natal day,  
Who shines as Honor’s living treasure!

O! let thy vines, a fount of health!  
Potent to banish care and sadness!  
Pour *to his name* their liquid wealth  
In cups of glory, and of gladness!

And fail not now thy voice to raise  
O Lavant! large domes excelling!  
For Wellington must love the praise  
Of truth and friendship’s favorite dwelling.
