Venus once of cash being short  
Did thus, but ’twas her last resort.  
Cupid she called, and sorrowing said,  
“My son, today I ask your aid —   
Exiled awhile by angry Jove  
I dare not yet remount above  
When down he sent me here to dwell  
I thought that I should like it well  
For cash in plenty he did give  
Allowing me in style to live,  
But things are now so very dear  
I can no more as wont appear.  
Oft have I tried, but tried in vain,  
For ah! I cannot credit gain —   
And tho’ consumed, he knows my store  
To Jove in vain I sue for more.  
Then haste, in flowery bands combine  
Those doves that must no more be mine.  
To market drive the spotless pair  
To sell them, be thy filial care.  
Alas! it grieves me to the heart  
With them so much beloved to part  
But hope that soon relenting Jove  
Again may take me to his love.  
Re-purchased from their mortal lord  
Fresh joy shall they to me afford —   
Oh may their price my debts but pay  
But time flies swift, away, away.”  
She spoke, nor Cupid ought replies  
But with the doves to market flies.  
Bought by a wealthy monarch there  
Large price obtains th’immortal pair.  
To Venus, then her offspring hies  
And to her hands consigns the prize.
