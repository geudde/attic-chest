##### A Free Translation of One of Buondelmonte’s Sonnets

<div class="author">Mrs Flaxman</div>

Love, often under friendship’s form  
Secretes himself in dimpled smiles;  
Now, makes his nest in bosoms warm,  
Now shows himself in artful wiles,  
Fair pity’s form he now assumes  
Now murmurs like a mournful dove,  
But watch his ever-varying plumes  
And still you’ll find that *love is love*.
