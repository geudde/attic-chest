<span class="title">The Rose of Eden  </span>
  
When all was perfect, all serene,  
This lovely blossom first was seen,  
It bloomed in Eden’s happy bowers  
The fairest, sweetest, of its flowers,  
On our first mother’s cheek it blew  
Ere sin, or grief, her bosom knew,  
And was the twin of that sweet smile  
Which dimpled on her cheek the while  
As Adam with a joyful pride  
Hailed the primeval, *blushing* bride.
