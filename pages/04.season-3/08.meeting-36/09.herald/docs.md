<div class="author">Miss Flaxman</div>

Ask the fair Eliza why  
The big tear trembles in her eye?  
Why amidst the festive throng  
She shuns the dance, denies the song?  
And why such fearful joy she shews  
And why her cheek with crimson glows,  
Why beam her looks with such delight  
When Celadon appears in sight?  
Then ask her if ’tis pow’rful Love  
Such ever varying feelings move?  
  
Quick from her heart, the purple tide will rush  
The conscious maid will answer with a *blush!*
