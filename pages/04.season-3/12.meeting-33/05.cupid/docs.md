<div class="author">Mr Vignoles</div>

I’m forced to hide myself and fly  
Far from the Regions of the Sky  
By her I’m beat, abus’d and chid  
Because I won’t do what she bids  
Nor always shoot my Skewers where she  
Thinks fit (a Minx) to order me  
Each Scheme I make, she’s sure to thwart  
(Gods! ’tis enough to break my heart)  
Drives me from Dances, Fairs and Wakes  
I havn’t seen a Play for Weeks.  
  
I knock’d at Pindus as I past  
And begg’d a Shelter and some rest  
The Muses had no sooner spy’d me  
Than one and all began to chide me  
This said I broke her Fiddlesticks  
And play’d her half a score of Tricks  
That, I had all her Brushes stole  
Some swore I’d got their Nectar Bowl  
Of sticking Pins in Chairs one tax’d me  
And ev’ry one agree to thrash me  
Thanks, to good Merc’ry, here I’m quiet  
And safe escap’d from all their Riot.  
My younger Brothers, Venus loves  
And plays with them in shady Groves  
But I, who’m not her Pet she wishes  
To treat and handle as she pleases.  
  
The Bow of Rib of Mutton made  
To me and not to her (Sly Jade)  
By Fate and Dolly Cook was giv’n  
A Gift I prize, beyond all Heav’n  
My Torch too, lit at Otna’s Fire  
By Vulcan, my *reputed* Sire  
I hear she’s trying to discover  
Where’s got her pretty silly Rover  
And promises the sweetest Kiss  
(For ought I know some other Bliss)  
To those who luckily shall find me  
And in rose garlands firmly bind me.  
I’m sure of this in all Arcade  
From simple Poan, up to My Lady  
There’s not a Nymph there, but prefers  
A kiss of mine to one of hers  
And this I’ll very quickly prove  
And try if Love knows ought of Love  
But yet the surer still to be  
I’ve thrown my Bow & Skewers away  
Turn’d my Love Torch into a Crook  
And Sheep instead of Hearts, I hook.
