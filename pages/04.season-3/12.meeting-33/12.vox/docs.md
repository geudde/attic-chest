When Mars was of Jupiter’s judgement informed  
In favour of Hermes, he raged and he stormed  
With anger he reddened as when he foreshows  
To terror struck mortals fresh combats and woes  
And seizing his helmet, his spear and his shield  
Challenged [He challenged] the Gods all at once to the field  
He [And] swore, that to Hermes he never would yield.  
  
But Pallas stept forward, and counselled her brother  
For the present at least his fierce anger to smother,  
Since openly thus at his Father to fly  
Would fill with contention and clamour the sky.  
And Jupiter then in his choler might send him  
To Hades, where tortures for ever might rend him  
Nor their sorrows or prayers could avail to befriend him  
She therefore advised he should use his endeavour  
His rights to preserve, and yet keep in Jove’s favour  
“And since with your Laurel my Olive they blend  
Your suit with the members I’m bound to befriend  
And propose that we straight convene each Constellation  
To hold in the Evening a [close] consultation.”   
  
#### Vox Stellarum  
  
All ye who remember the Vox Planetarum  
Attend to my verse, ’tis the last Vox Stellarum  
Nor let the great Moore, of Astrologers King  
Think I mean to depose him, I mean no such thing  
For I frankly declare, that I have no pretension  
To rival his Learning, his Art, or *Invention*  
We know his vast genius directs and controls  
States, Kingdoms and Kings, from the Line to the Poles  
Yet to build up a scheme, for a contest between  
Two Gods or two Planets — his wisdom I ween  
Would disdain to attend to a subject so mean  
Tho’ the Doctor erewhile, all the world will attest  
Has graced with his presence our classical Chest.  
  
It was Night, on my Pillow I pensive reclined  
And poems intended revolved in my mind,  
When in a bright blaze of ineffable Light,  
Jove’s Messenger, Iris, appeared to my sight  
When briefly the story ensuing she told.  
To the Attic Society bade me unfold  
  
“I therefore have called you, that if you approve  
Of my plea, you may straight seek the Mansion of Jove  
To entreat, at the first since unbiass’d their choice  
That now if I yield, I may yield to their voice.  
And of all information now fully possest  
Your suffrages, Mars and Minerva request!”  
  
When Mars had conclud’d, to banish disorder  
’Twas agreed that the Stars should all speak in their order  
That those next the Pole, should the parley commence  
And the others succeed in their oder from thence.  
  
But th’events which at this starry council befell  
If my strains you approve, the next reading shall tell.  
  
--- 
  
The order of speaking determined the Bear  
His thoughts on the subject began to declare,  
He briefly observed he had little to say  
Except, that as he was a creature of prey,  
Of course he should follow where Mars led the way,  
And if with his rival he happened to meet,  
He should have an embrace, much too strict, to be sweet,  
They smiled, and next Draco[^1] began (who of yore  
Was Minerva’s own Watchman and slept at her door  
But since that sage Goddess from Athens was chased  
In the skies, to reward his attention was placed,  
Where now through the Aether his volumes are rolled  
And the Pole of the Ecliptic involved in his fold.)  
  
“Since my blue-eyed Protectress left Attica’s plain  
To assume in the skies her erratic domain  
On Earth she ala! has disdained to abide  
And by Cunning and Craft has her place been supplied,  
Who to Alchemists, Lawyers, Projectors gave birth,  
And the whole tribe of Flatterers, infesting the Earth  
Whose project and schemes, in foundation unsound  
Have sooner, or later, all dropt to the ground.”  
  
“Till moved by the prayers of the best of the race  
TO Mortals at length, she discovered her face [^2]  
And finding with sorrow upon her return,  
Greece no longer was fit for Goddess’ sojourn,  
The relics of all she had formerly loved,  
To other Dominions with care she removed,  
Among them the Chest, which has caused this debate,  
And whose story you know, so I need not relate,  
Save that when fair Minerva had settled her plan  
And the Attic amusements at first were began,  
She appointed her Brother to reign on their night  
Which I therefore esteem his unchangeable right.  
Next Cepheus whose rule Ethiopia obeyes  
Declared from what his predecessors had said  
That if any change should be made in the Night  
To Jupiter only could Mars yield his right:  
For Mars also voted Cassiope fair  
Who dared with the Nereids her charms to compare,  
And who now sits forever enthroned in her chair,  
And Perseus and she whom his prowess did save  
When condemned for her mother’s [another’s] vain pride to the grave;  
For Mercury voted the Charioteer  
The Lion and Bootes, for Mars did appear  
For Cyllenius the Crown, for Mars Hercules rose  
Nor his plea did the Lyre of Apollo [the Muses] oppose,  
And next Cygnus her wishes began to disclose  
’Tis my pleasing employment from Lethe’s black stream  
To rescue each Poet, or Orator’s name,”  
  
“And on tablets engraved to consign them to Fame  
And oft have I view’d on these Tablets exprest  
Names beloved by the Muses, and dear to the Chest  
Which preserv’d from oblivion shall ever remain  
And Envy, and Time, will attack them in vain!  
In their Poems I found if Mars did not inspire  
At least that he lent them additional fire,  
And therefore for this I esteem it were best  
That beneath his protection, their Labours should rest.”

The Fox next arose, and he tried by a smile,  
To conceal from his hearers his bosom’s deep guile:  
“It grieves me,” he said, “of this contest to hear  
And I dread lest at length it disorder the sphere,  
For when two such great Gods for dominion contend  
It is hard to foresee [find out] where their quarrel may end.  
You are all well aware of the disinclination  
I have ever expressed against all innovation  
Yet such evident good on this change must attend  
That Mercury’s plea I am forced to befriend,  
The Muses reclined on some favorite Mountain,  
When the Bay and the Olive o’ershadow the Fountain  
To its soft flowing waters their voices unite,  
And sing of Love’s pains or of rural delight  
The Seasons that change, or the Stars as they move,  
Or raise their loud Hymns, to omnipotent Jove;  
But they fly when the Trumpet’s shrill [loud] clangour alarms  
Nor mingle their songs with the clashing of Arms.  
The City laid waste, or the harvest destroyed,  
On which for support its whole people relied,  
The brave Warrior’s fate, or the Patriot’s bier  
May draw from the Muse as she passes a tear;  
But she hastens to realms where no discord is found,  
And where Plenty, and Peace, shed their blessing around  
Hence with Mars it is plain, they can never unite,  
And the readings [Attics] not to be held on his Night.”  
  
“But Cyllenius who if dire Tisiphone rose,  
With his Magical Rod, could the Fury compose,  
Of Letters th’inventor, of commerce the friend,  
A Herald your charge always prompt to attend,  
Of Magic the Sire (but no Magic they need  
Whose Nymphs can so well in enchantment succeed)  
Mathematics thro’ them, to Terpsichore yield  
And Castles, and Palaces, fade from the field,  
Their smile the grave sculptor entices, and draws  
From his desk e’en the sable expounder of Laws  
Nay the Children of Chiron its sway have confest  
And Painters, and Soldiers, have honoured the Chest  
Then since so many talents in Hermes combine  
And Jove for the Night does all contest decline  
To Hermes [Cyllenius] let Mars his dominion resign.  
Thus artful he spoke, and the arrow replied,  
’Tis in vain you endeavour your cunning to hide,  
Shall he, who so lately was placed in the sphere,  
And then thro’ his art, not his merit, I fear —   
Shall sly Renard against innovation declare  
Innovation alone placed his worship in Heaven  
But while he pretends to condemn innovation  
Still in Mercury’s favour he makes declaration  
Sure the Goose which he carries, his speech must inspire  
Or perhaps, we the depth of his art should admire  
It is true the fair Nine, fly from Anarchy far,  
Nor blow the shrill Trumpet, nor mingle in War,  
But oft when in Battle two Armies unite,  
They [gaze] on the Field from a neighbouring height.”  
  
“And if some brave Patriot attention should claim  
Their songs give his actions forever to Fame.  
Hence Achilles, and Ajax, and Hector survive,  
Hence Eneas and Turnus forever shall live.  
Hence Orlando, Rinaldo, and great Charlemain  
Hence Godfrey, and Tancred, their fields, fight again,  
Such names to preserve, is their noblest employ  
And I therefore to Mars, give my suffrage with joy.”  
  
He spoke and sly Renard endeavoured in vain  
[Permission once more to address them again]  
To make a new speech as he said to explain  
But to order he quickly is called by the Fly  
And order, resounds from all parts of the sky  
Next the Eagle began, and in Mercury’s favour  
(As expected by all) used his utmost endeavour,  
For of old, when fair Venus [Astarte] had smitten the heart,  
Of the wily Cyllenius, he tried all his art,  
For a smile or a look, but with little success  
Till the Eagle with pity, beheld his distress  
And in Achelons as she bathed, he purloined,  
Her Sandal, and swiftly to Hermes consigned,  
Who the prize to its owner refused to return  
And the Goddess, the suppliant became in her turn  
Hence Hermes his friend, to requite for his care  
Procured him the place he now holds in the sphere  
The benevolent Dolphin, whose kindness did save  
The Son of Ulysses of yore, from the wave,  
Who rescued Arion, Palemon and bore  
The corpse of poor Hesiod, again to the shore  
Who in Heaven for his kindness to Mortals was placed  
With his suffrage the cause of the Argicide graced  
But Pegasus rose, and declared as the friend  
Of the Muses, he must to their interests attend,  
That the whole tribe of Poets he feared they would find  
To pilfering by Nature, were too much inclined.  
And therefore, should Hermes be placed at their head [?]  
From their thefts, and their tricks, we sad mischief might d[?]  
The Fly, once the rival of Phoebe the bright  
For the love of Endymion, that Goddess to spite  
Hearing she for Mercurius the first had proposed  
For his rival, directly her wishes disclosed.  
The Ram, who the children of Athamus bore  
When they fled from their stepmother Ino, of yore  
To Mars, when at Colchos, by Phrygus devoted  
For him (as his God) with celerity voted.  
  
The Bull that Europa conveyed o’er the wave  
His voice to the offspring of Maia now gave.  
The daughters of Atlas, the Hyades named  
With their sister the Pleiads for chastity famed  
Who the shipwrecked accuse, as the cause of their woes  
With their votes, the protector of commerce oppose  
The Brethren to whom beauteous Leda [Clytemnestra] gave birth  
For fraternal affection renowned upon Earth.  
Old Ocean’s dominion from Pirates who freed  
With their voices in favour of Hermes decreed  
The Crab on the side of Cyllenius declares  
But the Lion, his vote, gives in favour of Mars.

The daughter of Themis, Astrea the Fair  
Who honoured of old, our weak race with her care  
Who with Pallas oft deigned o’er our Laws to preside  
On the part of the injured each cause to decide  
When Men by her rules would no longer be swayed  
And Hermes, a Thing, called a Lawyer had made,  
To the wealthiest client his suffrage who sold  
And sapped the foundation of Justice — with Gold.  
Among Men to sojourn, she no longer would deign  
But fixed in the skies, her eternal domain.  
And since then, she has never been found upon Earth  
Save in schemes to which idle Projectors gave birth  
She declared that since Mars had been freely elected  
With Justice his plea could not now be rejected  
And her Scales in which she the Competitors weigh’d  
In favour of *Mars*, their decision had made.  
Serpentarius for wily Cyllenius declared,  
Poniatowski’s famed Bull for him also appeared.  
The Scorpion whose sting famed Orion destroyed  
By jealous Diana against him employed  
When enraged that his love bright Aurora should share  
Made the cause of insidious Mercurius [Hermes] his care  
Great Chiron the offspring of Saturn the Old  
Who to Peleus brave son did his knowledge unfold  
Who taught him alike the proud Courser to rein  
To close the deep round and diminish the pain  
Or draw from the Lyre its most musical strain.  
  
But since brave Alcides dread shaft in the blood  
Of the Lernean Hydra so deeply embrued  
In his foot was infixed, so excessive the smart  
He wish’d but in vain with his being to part  
To resign in the stream of oblivion his breath  
And envied poor Mortals, the blessing of Death  
Till his pain with compassion was witness by Jove  
Who removed him at length to the concave above,  
As a Warrior renowned while on Earth he remained  
The cause of great Mars, with his vote he maintained.  
  
The Goat Amalthea, to whom it was given  
To nourish the future Director of heaven,  
When Saturn his child would himself have destroyed  
Her influence in favour of Hermes employed.  
Young Ganymede, snatched up by Jove to the Sky,  
And the Fishes their interest for Mercury try.  
The Whale gives his vote for the homicide Mars,  
But the Hare on the side of Cyllenius appears.  
The meandering Eridanus, Orion the brave,  
And the Unicorn votes for the Homicide gave.  
The Dog, who the lovely Erigone drew  
To his corpse, when the Shepherds fame Icarus slew  
The Altar on which the Gods vowed they would aid  
Chronides, when war on the Titans he made  
The Raven, the Centaur, the Crown and the Crane  
With the Hydra near Lerna by Hercules slain  
With their interest the Warrior’s party sustain  
The Bee, and the Ship in which Jason left Greece  
When to Colchis he sailed to recover the Fleece.  

  
The Wolf, and the Cup to Apollo devoted,  
With the Peacock and Swordfish for Mars also voted. [^3]  
Then Pallas the votes having counted, declared  
In favour of Mars, that the numbers appeared  
And proposed that each bright Constellation should move  
Their petition to urge at the footstool of Jove,  
And that radiant Asterea, the speaker should prove.  
  
They agreed; As they moved in bright order along  
The Gods in astonishment gazed on the throng  
While Mortals affrighted, the concourse to view,  
Each moment expect some dread change to ensue.  
Great Herschel and Maskelyn, worthies renowned  
Thought their schemes of eternal duration unsound  
[^4] Johanna whose Oracles thousands can sway,  
Hence *pre*dicted that Gaul should Napoleon obey  
The Yorkshireman too, in Astrology skilled  
Deemed in this, that he saw his predictions fulfilled  
That the Planets and Stars in confusion were hurled  
[^5] And expected each Moment, the end of the World.  
E’en Moore, the strange sight in astonishment view’d  
And *feared that to England it boded no good!*  
  
Meanwhile they arrived, where enthroned in his state,  
Four Lords in attendance Jove’s [his] orders await,  
Then suppliant Astrea their grievances stated,  
The forbearance of Mars, how the Synod debated,  
And their fiat, with suitable comments related.  
The loudly implored him brave Mars to protect  
Till the members [Allies] themselves, should another elect.  
  
Jove replied with a smile, that he Hermes had sent  
Since the Planets in council had given consent,  
In the Attic Society votes to collect,  
But since Justice herself appeared Mars to protect  
Their deeds by his voice should not now be controlled  
But he willed, they ere long an Assembly should hold  
The claims of The Rivals unbiassed to hear,  
Who by person or proxy, that day should appear  
When each circumstance known, they should freely decide  
And th’opponents their judgement were bound to abide.  
**He nodded!** To Jove [Hermes] commission was given,  
To make known upon Earth, the decision of Heaven.

E.N.R. begs leave to state that the sole object of the Poem was to induce the author of ‘Vox Planetarum’ to discover his reasons for desiring the change in the Evening, when if they shall appear sufficient to counterbalance the inconvenience of alteration, ENR will be happy to vote in his favour.  

S.Y.

[^1]: The Ancient Greek Constellation of the Bear, comprehended not only the stars now known to us by the name of Ursa Major, but the whole Arctic Circle — The Lesser Bear was first distinguished by the Phoenicians — I have used the Greek division.

[^2]: The Planet named Pallas was not discovered ’till within these few years. 

[^3]: Three or four modern Constellations are here omitted for the sake of brevity.  
  
[^4]: It should be remembered that the *pre*dictions of this Lady are never shown until after the events have happened.  
  
[^5]: A Yorkshire Astrologer predicted a few years ago that the end of the World was fixed for Ash Wednesday 1808. When the day arrived, he said that thro’ his intercession the event was postponed.
