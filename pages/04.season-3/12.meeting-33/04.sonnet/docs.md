##### Translated from the Italian of Petrarch on the Death of Laura  
  
Fall’n is the Pillar high, the Laurel green,  
&emsp;That to my wearied Thought erst gave a Shade!  
Nor can by Lands, by Power, by India’s Gems  
&emsp;By countless Gold, my Loss be e’er repaid.  
  
Death has destroy’d, what most my Soul held dear;  
&emsp;The Treasure that with Rapture fill’d my Mind;  
Now lost is that, which though to either Pole  
&emsp;In weary Search I roam, I ne’er shall find!  
  
But if stern Destiny’s stern Will it be,  
&emsp;Why flows Complaint, why starts th’unbidden Tear,  
Oh! Life at first what Charms in thee appear,  
&emsp;How gay thou art, how cheerful & how free,  
&emsp;Yet in one fatal Morn, how oft we see  
Destroy’d, the soul of many a weary circling Year.
