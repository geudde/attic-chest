#### A Catholic Story  
  
There once was a Painter in Catholic Days,  
&emsp;Like Job, who eschewed all Evil;  
Still on his Madonnas the curious may gaze  
With Applause & Amazement, but chiefly his Praise  
&emsp;And Delight, was in painting the Devil.  
  
They were Angels compar’d to the Devils he drew,  
&emsp;Who beseig’d poor St Anthony’s Cell;  
Such hot burning eyes, such a d--nable hue,  
You could even smell Brimstone, their breath was so blue,  
&emsp;He painted the Devil as well.  
  
And now had the Artist a Picture begun,  
&emsp;’Twas over the Virgin’s church Door;  
She stood on the Dragon, embracing her Son;  
Many Devils already this Painter had done,  
&emsp;But this must out do all before.  
  
The old Dragons Imps, as they fled thro’ the air,  
&emsp;At seeing it, paus’d on the wing;  
For he had the likeness so just to a Hair  
That they came as if Apollyon himself had been there,  
&emsp;To pay their Respects to their King.  
  
Ev’ry Child at beholding it, shiver’d with dread,  
&emsp;And scream’d as he turn’d away quick:  
Not an old woman saw it, but, raising her head,  
Dropt a bead, made a Cross on her wrinkles, and said,  
&emsp;“God help me from ugly Old Nick!”  
   
What the Painter so earnestly thought on by Day,  
&emsp;He sometimes would dream of by night:  
But once he was startled as sleeping he lay,  
’Twas no Fancy, no Dream — he could plainly survey  
&emsp;That the Devil himself was in sight.  
  
“You rascally Dauber,” old Beelzebub cries,  
&emsp;“Take heed how you wrong me again!  
Though your Caricatures for myself I despise,  
Make me handsomer now in the multitude’s Eyes,  
&emsp;Or see if I threaten in vain!”  
  
Now the Painter was bold, and religious beside,  
&emsp;And on Faith he had certain Reliance:  
So, earnestly he all his Countenance ey’d,  
And thank’d him for sitting, with Catholic Pride,  
&emsp;And sturdily bade him defiance.  
  
Betimes in the morning the Painter arose,  
&emsp;He is ready as soon as ’tis light;  
Ev’ry look, ev’ry line, ev’ry Feature he knows,  
’Tis fresh in his Eye, to his Labor he goes,  
&emsp;And he has the wicked on quite.  
  
Happy man! He is sure the Resemblance can’t fail,  
&emsp;The tip of his nose is red hot,  
There’s his Grin and his Fangs, his Skin cover’d with Scale,  
And that — the identical Curl in his Tail,  
&emsp;Not a mark, not a Claw is forgot.  
  
He looks, and retouches again with Delight,  
&emsp;’Tis a Portrait complete to his mind;  
He touches again, and again feeds his Sight,  
He looks round for Applause, and he sees with affright,  
&emsp;*The Original* standing behind.  
  
“Fool! Idiot!” old Beelzebub grinn’d as he spoke,  
&emsp;And stampt on the Scaffold in ire;  
The Painter grew pale, for he knew it no joke,  
’Twas a terrible Height, & the Scaffolding broke,  
&emsp;The Devil could wish it no higher.  
  
“Help! Help me! O Mary!” he cried in alarm,  
&emsp;And the Scaffold sank under his Feet:  
From the Canvas the Virgin extended her arm,  
She caught the good Painter, she sav’d him from harm;  
&emsp;There were Thousands who saw, in the Street.  
  
The old Dragon fled, when the Wonder he spied,  
&emsp;And curs’d his own fruitless Endeavour;  
While the Painter call’d after, his Rage to deride,  
Shook his Pallet & Brushes in Triumph, and cried,  
&emsp;“I’ll paint thee more ugly than ever!”
