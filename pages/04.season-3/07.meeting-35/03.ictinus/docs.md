Oh hear, propitious hear, ye Nine, today  
To greet Ictinus frame some grateful Lay,  
He who has oft from your celestial stores  
Called with judicious hand your sweetest flowers,  
Who would those flowers in beauteous order twine  
To form a garland, for his Valentine,  
Would with Anacreon’s sprightly ease convey,  
The secret meaning of his moral lay.  
With elegance his flowing strains prolong  
And all the graces picture in his song.  

In vain I sue, th’ offended Nine disdain  
For such a recreant to inspire my strain  
Who since the Graces from the scene retire  
To sing refuses, and neglects the lyre  
Yet still though two are fled, a third remains  
Once the most honoured by your plausive strains  
Then let the “Goddess of the *Sylphic* mien”  
O’ercome your silence, and dispel your spleen  
Her smiles shall strive your labours to repay  
And chase with sprightly mirth your griefs away.

Nay more, your numbers, from the stormy north  
Again may lure the sweet Aglaia forth  
And in the charms of wit and beauty drest,  
Add new attractions to the Attic Chest.  

Let these inducements then your soul incline  
Once more to choose one for your Valentine.

Euphrosyne
