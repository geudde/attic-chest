Up lazy girl, the glorious sun  
Has now his daily race begun,  
While you supinely in your bed,  
Too long repose your drowsy head.  
Arise, my love, at this cool hour  
To mark each fragrant herb and flower  
That, glistening with the dews of morn  
The hills and laughing vales adorn.

Now soars the sprightly lark on high,  
And pours his warblings throâ€™ the sky,  
And now the woodland songsters all,  
In lively carols sweetly call.  
Up lazy girl, the glorious sun  
Has now his daily race begun,  
While sleeping in your snug warm bed,  
Your pillow holds your drowsy head.
