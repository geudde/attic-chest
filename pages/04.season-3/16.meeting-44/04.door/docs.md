##### Verses written on the door of a temple, on Plane Hill, Swainston & the seat of Sir John Barrington

<div class="author">Communicated by Mr Porden</div>

##### Original and Extempore

Lost in the vale of years I mourn,  
Those days that never must return,  
May ye whose early lives were spent,  
In pleasures, neâ€™er those days repent,  
For me, alas, the world I shun,  
And hide me from the mid-day sun.  
Yet here, beneath this lovely roof,  
I see, I hear, the keen reproof  
That life mispent is but a blot,  
How vain our joys, how soon forgot.

W.G.E.
