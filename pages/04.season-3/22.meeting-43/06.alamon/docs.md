> A wonderful ancient tradition of a little family who lived in a vinegar cruet, faithfully related by F:R:

#### 1

&emsp;There was a little Man  
&emsp;(’Twas so the story ran)  
Who the wonder rais’d of many fold that knew it;  
&emsp;For he house had none at all  
&emsp;But a dwelling very small.  
It was nothing but a vinegar cruet.

#### 2

&emsp;His little wife beside  
&emsp;Did there with him reside  
And their children (nine in number) squeezed into it;  
&emsp;Tho’ the space it was confin’d  
&emsp;Yet as all were of a mind,  
They found they’d room in plenty in the cruet.

#### 3

This very little blade  
&emsp;Was a fisherman by trade  
And his skill it was with envy all did view it;  
&emsp;Christen’d Alamon was he  
&emsp;And surnam’d Tippeny  
Widely famous for his vinegar cruet.

#### 4

Now the story it went on  
&emsp;That the good Alamon  
One morning in the sea his net threw it;  
&emsp;But the finny tribe that day,  
&emsp;Kept all out of the way  
And he fail’d of his provision for the cruet.

#### 5

When a young eel not aware  
&emsp;Nor taught to mind the snare  
Where the net was slyly laid, jump’d into it;  
&emsp;Wise Tippenny he said  
&emsp;“Half loaf’s better than no bread  
So I’ll take this little fish home to my cruet.

#### 6

The young fish then in a fright  
&emsp;When she found her dismal plight  
Her imprudence began now to rue it;  
&emsp;To the fisherman she said  
&emsp;Ah thou worthy little blade  
Take me not to your vinegar cruet.

#### 7

Alamon with a sigh  
&emsp;Thought of his little fry  
And says he, “We to others should do it  
&emsp;What done to us we wish,  
&emsp;So I’ll spare thee little fish  
From death in my vinegar cruet.

#### 8

No sooner this he cries  
&emsp;When lo! to his surprise  
The young eel her skin quickly slipped through it  
&emsp;And poor Tippanny afraid  
&emsp;Saw arise a fairy maid  
How he wish’d him in his vinegar cruet.

#### 9

The fairy in her hand  
&emsp;Wav’d a white coral wand  
With an air as tho’ the world she could subdue it  
&emsp;Yet was but a tiny elf  
&emsp;Less than Alamon himself  
Or his own little folk in his cruet.

#### 10

She said, “Be not in a fright  
&emsp;I’m a young fairy sprite,  
And my form I can at pleasure renew it  
&emsp;But in fish’s form  
&emsp;Had your pity not been warm  
I’d been serv’d up today in your cruet.

#### 11

Now because you have been kind  
&emsp;And to mercy were inclined  
Whatsoever you shall wish, will I do it  
&emsp;Hie home your wife consult  
&emsp;And bring me the result  
Of debates in your vinegar cruet.

#### 12

Then home he hurried fast  
&emsp;His wife told what had passed  
(Who at first scarce knew what to say to it)  
&emsp;But at last her vote she gave  
&emsp;They a spacious house should crave  
And leave the little vinegar cruet.

#### 13

“Wife,” (cried the little blade)  
&emsp;“You a foolish choice have made”  
And the fairy said so too, when she knew it.  
&emsp;“To your wish I yield consent”  
&emsp;Cried she, “but you’ll repent  
And wish you in your vinegar cruet.”

#### 14

She wav’d her wand then thrice  
&emsp;And a car rose in a trice,  
And the Tippennys she put all into it  
&emsp;At a stately house they light  
&emsp;Where they enter with delight  
And forget the little vinegar cruet.

#### 15

Yet tho’ all was quite enchanting  
&emsp;Still our wife found something wanting  
And a wish if once in view would pursue it  
&emsp;“Husband” (cries she) “hie away  
&emsp;And go seek the little fay  
Who brought usfrom our vinegar cruet.”

#### 16

“Say our dresses are so mean  
&emsp;I’m ashamed we should be seen;  
And your own is as bad, when I view it,  
&emsp;And there’s nothing one so loathes,  
&emsp;As the wearing shabby clothes,  
They were scarcely good enough for the cruet.

#### 17

Then away the husband went  
&emsp;And expressed her discontent  
To the fairy who already will knew it  
&emsp;And who rising from the wave  
&emsp;Said, “You wife her wish shall have  
Tho’ grown vain since she has quitted the cruet.”

#### 18

Then home the husband hies,  
&emsp;And on lifting up his eyes  
Towards his window he saw peeping tho’ it  
&emsp;His wife and children nine  
&emsp;All dressed out very fine  
They had never seen such clothes in their cruet.

#### 19

But this pleasure quickly passed  
&emsp;And prepared as did the last  
For something which still must ensue it  
&emsp;Mrs Tippanny would vie  
&emsp;With all the great and high  
Times nine changed since she quitted her cruet.

#### 20

“Dear husband,” she exclaimed  
&emsp;“Pray let me not be blamed  
If I beg you your suit to renew it  
&emsp;With the fairy to bestow  
&emsp;Some wealth to make us go  
Or we soon must return to our cruet.

#### 21

The little man once more  
&emsp;Went back to the sea shore  
Tho’ sorry he again was to do it;  
&emsp;And the fairy he besought her  
&emsp;To keep them above water,  
For sink or swim they’d not return to the cruet.

#### 22

“What still another wish?”  
&emsp;Replied the fairy fish,  
“Discontent I begin to see thro’ it,  
&emsp;But your wants shall be supplied,  
&emsp;Tho’ they’re greatly multiplied  
Since you left your old abode the snug cruet.

#### 23

Now of wealth our wife possessed  
&emsp;She might have been quite blessed  
If content had been added unto it.  
&emsp;But tho’ finishing each day  
&emsp;With op’ra ball and play  
She was not half so blithe as in her cruet.

#### 24

Amidst her ample store  
&emsp;She still pin’d for something more  
Grudg’d prosperity in others to view it,  
&emsp;Good to other folk she eyed  
&emsp;As if to her denied  
Grown so selfish since she quitted her cruet.

#### 25

Not contented then with wealth,  
&emsp;Domestic peace and health  
Tho’ envied by every one who knew it;  
&emsp;This restless little dame  
&emsp;At fashion now did aim,  
And to make folk forget the old cruet.

#### 26

So tickets fly about  
&emsp;For Mrs Tippanny’s grand rout,  
“All the world,” (she declared) “should come to it”  
&emsp;With apartments gay and many,  
&emsp;She had scarce more room if any,  
Than when living in her vinegar cruet.

#### 27

Tho’ her company was gay,  
&emsp;And very late did stay  
Yet her pillow she with tears did bedew it;  
&emsp;For among her party one  
&emsp;Had said she was outdone:  
Such thoughts ne’er broke her out in the cruet.

#### 28

But her discontent to hide  
&emsp;Mrs Tippenny still tried,  
With the great who with laughter did view it,  
&emsp;Tho’ her suppers they commended,  
&emsp;Yet they sneered that she pretended  
To fashion, who had risen from a cruet.

#### 29

Still for equipage she sigh’d,  
&emsp;But the fay who wealth supplied  
Said, “A carriage she should ne’er get into it;  
&emsp;Unless that she would take  
&emsp;For old remembrance sake  
Her crest the little vinegar cruet.”

#### 30

This condition hurt her pride  
&emsp;Yet at last she did decide  
For the carriage (tho’ much she did rue it)  
&emsp;Yet when finish’d ’twas so neat  
&emsp;And in all things so complete  
She hop’d nobody would think of the cruet.

#### 31

But alas! to her pain  
&emsp;Came the wind and the rain,  
And the sun his bright beam he withdrew it,  
&emsp;And she fear’d her coach to use,  
&emsp;Lest its beauty it should lose,  
And look as shabby as the vinegar cruet.

#### 32

Her spouse again she sent  
&emsp;To give her sorrows vent;  
(He was loathe his complaint to renew it)  
&emsp;“Ask the fairy for bright weather  
&emsp;To ride out all together,  
Or we might as well be still in our cruet.

#### 33

High swell’d the angry wave,  
&emsp;And deep sighs the wind it gave,  
Poor Tippanny fear’d ill would ensue it;  
&emsp;And indeed his fears came right,  
&emsp;For in frowns arose the sprite,  
Who brought him and all his tribe from the cruet.

#### 34

“I think the more you have  
&emsp;The more you seem to crave”  
Said the fay, “but you shortly shall rue it  
&emsp;Since I no more can grant  
&emsp;To every idle want:  
Wants which ne’er you dreamt upon in your cruet.

#### 35

There little you desir’d,  
&emsp;And little you requir’d,  
And your trade you with glee did pursue it;  
&emsp;Then little was your pain,  
&emsp;And if little was your gain  
Yet a little was enough for the cruet.

#### 36

A great house when you did crave,  
&emsp;And when great wealth I gave  
Great increase of your wants did ensue it;  
&emsp;And you greatly did encroach,  
&emsp;And to your great reproach  
Were a great deal less content than in your cruet.

#### 37

Since you know not when to stop  
&emsp;Nor where your suit to drop  
My power of course I withdraw it  
&emsp;For my bounty was abused,  
&emsp;And to no good purpose used,  
So I’ve vow’d to send you back to your cruet.

#### 38

The fay her wand then wav’d,  
&emsp;The gay mansion disappear’d,  
To the wonder of all who did view it;  
&emsp;To pieces now it goes,  
&emsp;And from the ruins rose  
The humble little vinegar cruet.

#### 39

Here a new distress befell,  
&emsp;For they all had fared so well  
That hardly could they now squeeze into it;  
&emsp;“A short time,” the fairy cries  
&emsp;“Will reduce you to its size,  
And fit you for your vinegar cruet.

#### 40

Establish’d there once more,  
&emsp;Not less happy than before  
Now Tippenny his trade did renew it,  
&emsp;And tho’ some disputes arose,  
&emsp;(’Tis so the story goes)  
That they lived and they died in their cruet.
