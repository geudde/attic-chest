##### The Captive Lover’s Epistle to his Mistress by the Carrier Pigeon

Ah! what to me is spring’s return!  
Or the soft smile of summer’s morn,  
I, wretched captive, sit forlorn  
&emsp;To mourn my fate.  
Beneath my grated windows see  
The garden bloom’s — but not for me  
And every bird so wild and free  
&emsp;Can woo his mate!

And once so gay, so free was I,  
Before this heart had learned to sigh  
No tear had ever dimm’d mine eye  
&emsp;But pity drawn.  
From sweet to sweet, from joy to joy,  
I roved a happy, thoughtless boy,  
My cup of bliss had no alloy  
&emsp;In life’s fair dawn.

Like a young bee I gaily flew,  
The loveliest blossoms met my view,  
And still did I the chase renew,  
&emsp;Fresh joy to prove:  
While thus I passed each careless hour  
Blithe o’er the meads and in the bower  
I found the sweetest fairest flower!  
&emsp;That flower was love!  

’Twas love, dear maid, and thou wert she  
Who taught me that sweet flower to see  
Which in my breast still worn shall be  
&emsp;So fresh and fair.  
First in thy blush I saw it rise  
And soon with joy and fond surprise  
I found it in my fair-one’s eyes  
&emsp;And hailed it there.

Haste then Elvira, dear as fair,  
Haste love, thine answer to prepare  
They pigeon swiftly through the air  
&emsp;Will take her flight.  
And o’er the mountain, o’er the sea,  
A leaf of this fair flower from thee  
Pledge of thy truth, thy constancy  
&emsp;Shall bless my sight.
