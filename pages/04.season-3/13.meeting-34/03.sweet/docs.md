Tell me sweet on, tell me why  
Time so swiftly passes by?  
While I rove the woods among  
While I listen to thy Song  
While on thee my looks are bent  
While on thee each thoughts intent  
Tell me sweetest, tell me why  
Time so swiftly passes by?  
  
Ah, I’ve found the reason why  
I can read it in thine eye  
In thine Eye, love’s truest book  
Where for truth I always look  
It says, why time so swiftly can move  
Is, that he borrows wings of Love  
And this must be the reason why  
He so swiftly passes by.
