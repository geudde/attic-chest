Say Love, what master shows thy art,  
&emsp;That sweet Improver of mankind,  
Which warms with Sentiment the heart,  
&emsp;With Information hones the mind?  

Whence does the Soul, disdaining Earth,  
&emsp;To Ether wing its ardent way?  
Who gives the bold expression birth  
&emsp;That all its Images convey?  

’Tis not to Greece’s learned Soil  
&emsp;The world this happy Culture owes  
Which not from Aristotle’s tail,  
&emsp;Nor yet from Plato’s fancy flows.  

Apollo and the tuneful Nine,  
&emsp;Attempt the envied Song in vain;  
Their numbers are not so divine,  
&emsp;As is the Lover’s tender strain!  

Scholastic art, the Muses’ Lyres,  
&emsp;In vain their Privileges boast;  
The Love breathes a purer fire;  
&emsp;He sings the best who feels the most.  

No Pow’r alone, and none below,  
&emsp;But Thou, O Love! can thee express;  
To thee, thy Sentiments we owe,  
&emsp;To thee, we owe their glowing dress.  

Thou can’st refine the simple Breast,  
&emsp;And to a Poet raise a Swain,  
His humble Soul, by thee impress’d,  
&emsp;Assumes a warm exalted Strain.  

His manners take a nobler turn;  
&emsp;His Inspiration we descry;  
Upon his Cheek we see it burn,  
&emsp;And speak, in Lightning from his Eye.  

With such a new, ideal Store  
&emsp;Thy dictates fill the rustic Mind,  
Such Oratory Shepherds pour,  
&emsp;They leave a Cicero far behind.  

Nay, such nice heights thy Pow’r can reach,  
&emsp;With thee, such varied Rhetoric dwells;  
That e’en the struggling, broken Speech  
&emsp;The modelled Period far excels.  

Thy Silence oft, in striking Pause  
&emsp;The Lovers great Ideas paints;  
Sublime conception is its Cause;  
&emsp;The mind expands, but language faints.  

Free, uncompress’d, the Thought appears,  
&emsp;Which words would awkwardly control,  
And Nature hold our Eyes, and Ears;  
&emsp;We seem to hear, and see the Soul.  

The letter’d Youth let Plato’s Page,  
&emsp;With generous Sentiment inspire;  
I’m better taught than by a Sage,  
&emsp;And catch a more etherial Fire.  
 
A nobler and a speedier aid,  
&emsp;Receive I from *Eliza’s* Eyes;  
By them more happy I am made;  
&emsp;And as I’m happy, am I wise.  

Let the mistaken world suppose  
&emsp;That nature in Old Homer reigns;  
Or, still, more blindly think she flows  
&emsp;In Virgil’s cold, & labour’d Strains.  

I came my Love upon a Tree;  
&emsp;Scholars consult its faithful Rind;  
Throw Books away, for there you’ll see  
&emsp;A lovelier Copy of the Mind.
