Retiring mists forsake the mountain’s height  
Again appears the orb of Heav’nly Light  
Majestic Sun! I hail thy primal ray  
In praise of Him who gives another day.  
Again the meadows healthful breeze I greet,  
Or search begemm’d with dew the meadow sweet,  
Enjoy the hour when wrapt in deep repose  
Mankind forgets their real or fancied woes.  
Yet, breaks forth Morn to ev’ry eye thus clear?  
And are there not some hearts it cannot cheer?  
The Widow doom’d in poverty to weep —   
Laments the fate of innocence asleep;  
It wakes with smiles — the tear that dews its cheek  
Paints anguish greater than the heart can speak.  
To her returning morn no transport knows;  
Her husband lost, and aggravated woes  
Press heavy on Affection’s tender breast  
That rob the day of joy, and night of rest.  
The Captive o’er its walls its progress eyes,  
And at th’obstructed sunbeam mournful sighs,  
The mind associates many a fond idea  
That Sun perhaps in distant climes may cheer,  
T’abode of all that claims a father’s tear  
The sufferer from his bed of anguish sees,  
The morning break upon the woodland trees.  
Disease flows rapid thro’ each fever’d vein  
The prospect charms no more — for all is pain.  
Shall mem’ry faithful to the past review,  
The time I’ve mark’d, when wet with early dew  
His feet have press’d the wild thyme scented glade  
To seek the violet in its deepest shade  
He roams no more — while I from yonder thorn  
List to the thrush that carols in the morn:  
With mind insensible awhile to care  
Note the Larks progress thro’ the fields of Air,  
For health is mine, and nature’s charms increase  
When the heart whispers all within is peace.  
Yet have I more deserv’d the meed of health  
Than death’s allotted Victim son of wealth  
Or mother weeping for her infant born  
To struggle with the world’s unfeeling scorn  
Or wretched Captive shut from lighty Air  
Whom sad reflection tortures to despair.  
Ah! no upbraiding conscience seems to say  
“Thy Sin no less — frail mortal *thou* as *they*”  
Thou Pow’r supreme who can’t all good bestow  
Make me reflect to whom my bliss I owe!  
Inspire with gratitude my early pray’r;  
For ev’ry blessing of thy daily care,  
And as the tents of morn adorn the skies  
Let my first thoughts to *Thee* my God arise.
