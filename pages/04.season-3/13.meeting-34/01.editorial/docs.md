The productions to be read this Evening are of a graver cast, than many that have made the Entertainment of former meetings. We trust however that they will not be less gratifying to our Auditors, as they are generally speaking distinguished by harmonious versification and poetical sentiment, and will perhaps afford a more durable pleasure than lighter pieces that exhilarate for the moment, and are then forgotten. The Poem of Sun-rise joins in the qualities above mentioned, moral feeling that enhances their value. This Poem will be followed by

* “Say Love what Master shews they art”
* “Tell me sweet one, tell me why”
* “You ask me why with so much care”

which having no titles we must distinguish by their first verses. The Lines to Miranda are of the same Character they are all amatory and elegant. “The Antiques at Paris, from Schiller” are neatly translated. We think the Epigram on the Chinese Astronomers well pointed and the Anticipation of Valentines Day very pretty. We are much obliged to our Scotch Correspondent, both for her prose address to the Editress, and her verses. We assure her the Attic Chest will think itself honoured by her frequent communications, and if we may venture to speak for others that the Lasses of Helicon will rejoice to see her of their Sisterhood. The Charade is a nut that our Correspondents may crack at leisure, but our teeth are unequal to the labour. We are sorry that we have not yet received a continuation of the Sylphiad, but we have been favoured with the second Canto of the Restoration, which with the first announced at our last Meeting, we shall now read, but shall forbear to make any particular Criticisms for the reasons before assigned, namely that minute defects in the first sketch of a long Poem should not be too rigidly censured. By the formality of its openings, and the Story-telling propensity of the Author we are inclined to believe that it will not be completed in less than four and twenty Cantos, but if it be well executed, we shall not repine, for we cannot have too much of a good thing.

We have received the Briefs but in the absence of the leading Counsel the trial is deferred.
