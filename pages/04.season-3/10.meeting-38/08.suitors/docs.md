<div class="author">Miss Porden</div>  

&emsp;Three suitors once a Damsel wooed,  
&emsp;Of faultless form, and noble blood,  
&emsp;One an Astronomer of name,  
&emsp;The next a Chemist, high in fame,  
&emsp;The third, an Architect renowned,  
&emsp;For science, taste, and art profound.  
&emsp;	One day the Damsel they addressed  
&emsp;In turn, and strove to speak their best.  
&emsp;The Chemist the discourse began  
&emsp;And thus its fluid tenor ran.  

Oh fairest compound of celestial parts,  
&emsp;Of dire effects the dear unconscious cause,  
Whose eyes with *radiant* heat now fuse our hearts,  
&emsp;And bid us own attractions sovereign laws  
No longer with that frigid glance congeal  
&emsp;The vermil globules that our veins distend  
But let some melting word its passage steal  
&emsp;And in solution, grains of pity send.  
 
No more with that chill negative dispense  
Electric shocks thro’ each benumbed sense  
But let the positive, that saccharine word,  
To me the acme of delight afford.  

&emsp;The Architect next tried his art  
&emsp;To build his image in her heart.  

Oh matchless temple, sweet perfection’s shrine  
The <span data-tippy="fairest" class="green">noblest</span> raised by Nature’s power  
Where all the parts in just proportion join  
And make you o’er you sister beauties tower  
Unused to speak, how shall I frame my strain  
To reach the summit of perfection’s height,  
To <span data-tippy="climb above your misplaced" class="green">rise superior to your</span> high disdain  
Alas I fear I vainly try the flight.  
 
Thy love to compass, what would I not do —   
Be ruled by me, and this my plan pursue,  
<span data-tippy="Let Hymen’s lasting Links" class="green">Let Hymen in firm bonds</span> our hands combine  
And let so fair an ddifice be mine.  

&emsp;Next to the Astonomer t’was given  
&emsp;To scale the azure vault of Heaven.  

<div class="pencil">
Th’ Astronomer the next essayed<br>
To win the favour of the maid.<br>  
And then to ease his amorous pains<br>  
Addressed in celestial strains.
</div>

My cynosure, my sun, no longer lour,  
Nor with malignant aspect blast my hope.  
But sweetly smile on this propitious hour  
Thou brightest light beneath the starry cope.  

Celestial Maid, some gracious sign impart  
Nor thus eccentric to my hopes appear  
Favour the flame that lights thy lover’s heart  
Thou richest glory of our nether sphere.  
No more let thine opposing voice destroy  
Each promised system of delight and joy  
But in conjunction to my wishes move  
And own bright fair, the heavenly light of love.  

They spoke. Ye <span data-tippy="Attic" class="green">British</span> Nymphs declare,  
Who most deserved to win the Fair.  

<div class="pencil">
Whose eloquence the best might move,<br>  
A maiden’s youthful heart to love<br>  
And fix the dubious fair.  
</div>
