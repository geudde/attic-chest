A village maid in lowly guise  
With rosy cheeks and hazel eyes  
With lips that wore the sweetest smile  
A cheerful heart and void of guile;  
One eve that clos’d the brightest day  
That ever graced the reign of May  
To cherish health and seek for flowers  
Roam’d forth, amidst the fields and bowers.  
The modest primrose, simply gay  
That cheers the woodman’s footpath way,  
The daisies, kiss’d with crimson hue,  
And golden cups, and violets blue  
That breathing round their odours sweet  
Betray their shady close retreat;  
And cheerful cowslips that adorn  
The verdant mead; and blossom’d thorn  
Whose pearly buds, and cherry flow’rs  
Give fragrance to the vernal bow’rs,  
All these she cull’d, all these and more  
Which nature from her bounteous store  
In dens by night, and showers by day  
Pours in the loss of blooming May.  
  
Say reader could thy heart of pride  
The simple village maid deride  
Say, could’st thou go and rudely tear  
Her nosegay, cull’d with so much care;  
And could’st thou proudly laugh to scorn  
Her violets blue, her blossom’d thorn,  
Could’st thou her artless smiles despise  
Her rosy cheeks, and hazel eyes,  
Oh if thou could’st away, away,  
For *thee* I do not tune the lay  
So give the useless labor o’er  
And close the book and read no more;  
For like the maiden of my song  
I — pacing life’s dull road along  
Have oft my idle hours beguil’d  
In wand’ring through the woodlands wild,  
Or o’er the meads that sweetly spread  
Beneath Parnassus’ airy head  
And there I’ve cull’d, (but not for *Thee*)  
A few wild flowers of poesy —   
Not such, as grac’d the rocky height  
Where *Homer* sing’d his daring flight,  
Or in the cultured garden grew,  
From where his beauties *Virgil* drew,  
Or where our *Milton* used to twine  
His wreaths of amaranth divine;  
No — mine are simple flowers that grow  
Close in the sheltered lake below  
But some with prouder plants may vie  
In fragrant scent, and brilliant dye  
And gentle souls who not disdain  
To wander o’er the uncultured plain  
Who nature’s simple charms admire  
Her modest mien, and mild attire  
Well pleased my rosied flowers will view  
And praise their fragrance and their hue;  
But thy proud heart and hearts like thine  
Will spurn such humble wreaths as mine  
Thy pedant soul and critic eyes  
Will scorn the blooms I fondly prize:  
But reader couldest thou go with me  
The simple village maid to see,  
Say could’st thou *join her* as she races  
Along the meads and through the graces,  
Could’st thou for her the flowrets choose  
Of sweetest scent and liveliest hues,  
And as the maid approves the choice  
Say reader could’t thou then rejoice  
To see her grateful smiles arise,  
Her glowing cheeks and sparkling eyes  
Oh! if thou could’st proceed, *proceed,*  
My tales and simple songs to read  
Oh if thou could’st be friend of mine  
For gentle is that heart of thine —   
Oh ponder well, ye parents dear  
To save a wretched life  
Nor roast young dames at kitchen fires,  
Tho’ daughter, maid, or wife.  
  
Sir Argus was a gallant knight  
Large, both of flesh and bone;  
And many a devil dipped in black,  
Waited this knight upon.  
  
He printed shop-bills great and small  
And stuck them in the *Streets*  
Which pasted on both bulk and stall  
The gaping stranger meets.  
  
They told of giants ten feet high,  
And dwarfs again so small,  
And when York waggons leave the north,  
To creep for Leadenhall.  
  
Play-bills, quack nostrums, London news,  
To make folk read and stare,  
Deaths, marriages, lost puppy dogs,  
And price of crockery ware.  
  
So mighty were this great knight’s deeds  
So talked of everywhere,  
The eldermen determined straight,  
To choose him for Lord Mayor!  
  
That he should wear a red-furr’d gown,  
And eke a golden chain,  
And stuff down turtle all day long,  
With all his might and main.  
  
These tidings to Sir Argus came  
In South-gate where he lay  
Who called out “Wife, make haste down,”  
Then thus, to her did say.  
  
He said, “Oh wife, I’m chose Lord Mayor,  
You shall be dressed so fine,  
Plaster’d with laces gold, and pearl,  
Whene’er we go to dine.”  
  
“Two lusty yeomen thou shalt have  
Whose bellies and round faces  
Shall grace black gowns, with tassels dight  
And walk before, with maces.”  
  
“But now we talk of dinner, love  
A dinner we must give  
To deputies and aldermen  
As surely as we live.”  
  
“Husband,” the courteous dame replies  
“Who shall this feast prepare?  
For I must have the livelong day  
To dress and curl my hair.”  
  
“To put on jewels and good gear,  
As heart can e’er desire,  
Which sputtering grease and cooks would spoil  
Too near a kitchen fire.”  
  
“There’s daughter Grace,” the Mayor replies,  
“Will see the dinner done  
She can make plasters, pies, puff paste,  
And poultice all alone!”  
  
Fair Grace into the kitchen went,  
With bib & tucker too,  
To see the cook spit all the meat  
And boil, roast, fry, and stew.  
  
Compositors the pudding stirred  
And devils turned the spits!  
While scullions slopped the scalding grease,  
As if out of their wits!  
  
Here’s your health Grace, don’t be so shy  
Why you’ve no need to stare,  
I hope girl you’ll be married soon —   
And make a good Lord Mayor!  
  
The aldermen drank to their Lord  
With cups fill’d to the brim  
And wish’d his sons and daughters all!  
Might be Lord Mayor’s like him!  
  
Fair Grace on conquest still intent  
Looked for some generous youth  
Whom she might rob of peace of mine  
Unless he plighted truth.  
  
A soldier and a parson too,  
She struck with secret glance,  
They dizzy grew, & plunged, & kicked,  
As if in antic dance.  
  
At length from off their chairs they fell,  
And sprawled upon the floor,  
The folks all thinking they were dead,  
Soon bore them to the door!  
  
Ye hapless youths knew not your fate  
When ye went there to dine,  
But now cheer up, they’re not quite dead  
With love — nor rosy wine!  
  
They sang and drank, and roared aloud  
All those that came to dine  
And all were laid flat on the floor  
By Grace’s eyes — and wine!  
  
Then bless the Mayor and aldermen  
And send them store of meat  
With more good wine and sugar sops  
Than they can drink, or eat!
