<div class="author">Communicated by Miss Flaxman</div>

On search, I find upon record,
(From history it is taken)
One couple only on their word,
Did ever win the bacon.

Yet here’s a myst’ry wondrous great
Which may be known to some
The man ’tis said could freely prate,
The wife, was deaf and dumb!

Then first, this riddle clear explain,
Your wit it just doth suit,
Why man the flitch can never gain
Unless his wife’s a mute?

1810

A desperate lover —   
of bacon!
