There’s Cauld Kale in Aberdeen  
And Colleges o’ learning  
In Berners Street has often been  
A class o’ rare discerning  
To Attic With they ha’ pretence  
To humour that gies nae offence  
To social joy and solid sense  
Ilk art of entertaining.  
  
There’s Cauld Kale, some may think fine  
And some a glass o’ claret  
Some prefer the *Whiskey* shine  
And to a friend will spare it  
But gin ye wish a *mental treat*  
Wi’ gleefu’ mirth, that gars ye greet  
Then hie awa’ to Berners Street  
For there you’ll surely share it.
