Ye Tapsters who’re wont to draw Porter or Ale,  
&emsp;And would probably want to draw *more*,  
You may hear of a Plan, from a very short Tale,  
&emsp;Which, ’tis likely you ne’er heard before.  
  
*Giles Trick’em* an Hostler the world did begin,  
&emsp;’Till on Strength of each Traveller’s Bounty,  
He set up a Pot-house; and there he laid in,  
&emsp;I think the worst Ale in the County.  
  
Giles’s Maxim was this — “If my Profits are great,  
&emsp;The sooner I taste the world’s Pleasures;  
And hence — like some wise Men in the State —   
&emsp;He would often times Deal in “half measures.”  
  
To a Customer once, as conversing they stood,  
&emsp;Giles bragg’d (for he always would speak  
Of his Trade in the handsomest Terms that he could)  
&emsp;That he drew his three Hogsheads a week.  
  
“That’s a vast Deal indeed,” quoth the other, “yet still  
&emsp;As you don’t seem a man to mind trouble,  
I’m certain of this — that you may, if you will,  
&emsp;Draw nearly that Quantity double.”  
  
“I suppose,” replied *Giles*, with a wink of his Eye  
&emsp;“That you mean me to mix certain Drugs  
To make People drink — ” “Why, no truly not I;  
&emsp;What I meant was by ‘Filling your Mugs’”
