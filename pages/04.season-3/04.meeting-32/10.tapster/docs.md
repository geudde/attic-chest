Ye tapsters who’re wont to draw porter or ale,  
&emsp;And would probably want to draw *more*,  
You may hear of a plan, from a very short tale,  
&emsp;Which, ’tis likely you ne’er heard before.  
  
*Giles Trick’em* an hostler the world did begin,  
&emsp;’Till on strength of each traveller’s bounty,  
He set up a pot-house; and there he laid in,  
&emsp;I think the worst ale in the county.  
  
Giles’s maxim was this — “If my profits are great,  
&emsp;The sooner I taste the world’s pleasures;  
And hence — like some wise men in the state —   
&emsp;He would often times deal in “half measures.”  
  
To a customer once, as conversing they stood,  
&emsp;Giles bragg’d (for he always would speak  
Of his trade in the handsomest terms that he could)  
&emsp;That he drew his three hogsheads a week.  
  
“That’s a vast deal indeed,” quoth the other, “yet still  
&emsp;As you don’t seem a man to mind trouble,  
I’m certain of this — that you may, if you will,  
&emsp;Draw nearly that quantity double.”  
  
“I suppose,” replied *Giles*, with a wink of his eye  
&emsp;“That you mean me to mix certain drugs  
To make people drink — ” “Why, no truly not I;  
&emsp;What I meant was by ‘Filling your mugs’”
