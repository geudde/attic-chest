Of all the flowers that Earth adorn,  
Waked by the genial breath of morn,  
The rose of red, the rose of white  
Find greatest favour in our sight.  
  
&emsp;Of all the maids that tread the green,  
Maria is the fairest seen,  
Scarce with her neck the white can vie  
And in the red rose’ vermil dye  
Her cheeks’ bright hue we scarce descry.  
&emsp;One morn with me the lovely maid  
Along a blooming garden strayed,  
I asked her which the flower she chose,  
&emsp;Give me the fairest flower that blows  
The white, and eke the vermil rose,”  
She cried, I eager to obey  
Snatched one from off each trembling spray,  
When laid upon her gentle breast  
They calmed their enmity to rest,  
Once more like sisters, now they meet,  
Together blend their perfumes sweet  
Thus innocence and virtue move  
The fellest foes to peace and love.
