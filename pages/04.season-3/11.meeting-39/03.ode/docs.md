<span class="title">I</span>

Hark! heard ye not yon footsteps dread,  
That shook the hall with thundering tread?  
&emsp;&emsp;With eager haste  
&emsp;&emsp;The fellows passed;  
&emsp;Each intent on direful work,  
High lifts his mighty blade, and points his deadly fork.  
 
<span class="title">II</span>

But hark! the portals sound, and pacing forth,  
&emsp;&emsp;With steps, alas! too slow,  
The college gyps, of high illustrious worth,  
&emsp;&emsp;With all the dishes in long order go:  
&emsp;In the midst, a form divine  
&emsp;Appears the fam’d sirloin;  
And soon with plums and glory crown’d  
Almighty pudding sheds its sweets around.  
&emsp;Heard you the din of dinner bray?  
&emsp;&emsp;Knife to fork, and fork to knife;  
&emsp;&emsp;Unnumber’d heroes in the glorious strife,  
Thro’ fish, flesh, pies, and puddings, cut their destin’d way.  

<span class="title">III</span>

See beneath the mighty blade,  
&emsp;Gor’d with many a ghastly wound,  
Low the fam’d sirloin is laid,  
&emsp;And sinks in many a gulf profound.  
&emsp;&emsp;Arise, arise ye sons of glory,  
&emsp;&emsp;Pies and puddings standing before ye:  
&emsp;&emsp;See the ghosts of hungry bellies  
&emsp;&emsp;Point a yonder stand of jellies;  
&emsp;&emsp;While such dainties are beside ye,  
&emsp;&emsp;Snatch the goods the gods provide ye;  
&emsp;&emsp;Mighty rulers of the state,  
&emsp;&emsp;Snatch before it is too late:  
For swift as thought the pudding, jellies, pies,  
Contract their giant bulks, and shrink to pygmy size.  

<span class="title">IV</span>
 
From the table now retreating,  
&emsp;All around the fire they meet,  
And with wine, the sons of eating  
&emsp;Crown at length their mighty treat:  
Triumphant plenty’s rosy graces  
Sparkle in their jolly faces;  
And mirth and cheerfulness are seen  
In each countenance serene.  
 
&emsp;Fill high the sparkling glass,  
&emsp;&emsp;And drink th’ accustomed toast;  
&emsp;&emsp;Drink deep ye mighty host,  
&emsp;And let the bottle pass.  
&emsp;Begin, begin the jovial strain,  
&emsp;&emsp;Fill, fill the mystic bowl,  
&emsp;And drink, and drink, and drink again,  
&emsp;For drinking fires the soul.  

But soon, too soon with one accord they reel,  
&emsp;Each on his seat begins to nod,  
All conqu’ring Bacchus’ power they feel,  
&emsp;And pour libations to the jolly god.  
At length with dinner and with wine oppressed,  
Down in the chairs they sink, and give themselves to rest.
