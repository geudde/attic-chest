##### Song Written by a Friend to His Wife in 1783

I love the jocund dance,  
The softly-breathing song,  
Where Innocent Eyes do glance,  
And where lisps the Maiden’s tongue.  
  
I love the laughing Vale,  
I love the echoing rill,  
Where Mirth does never fail,  
And the Jolly Swain laughs his fill.  
  
I love the pleasant Cot,  
I love the innocent bower  
Where white and brown is our Pot  
Or fruit in the mid-day hour.  
  
I love the oaken seat,  
Beneath the oaken tree,  
Where all the Old Villagers meet,  
And laugh our sports to see.  
  
I love our Neighbors all  
But — Mary — I better love thee  
And love them I ever shall,  
But thou art all to me.  
  
William
