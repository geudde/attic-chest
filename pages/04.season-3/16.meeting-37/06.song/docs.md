##### Song Written by a Friend to His Wife in 1783

I love the jocund dance,  
The softly-breathing song,  
Where innocent eyes do glance,  
And where lisps the maiden’s tongue.  
  
I love the laughing vale,  
I love the echoing rill,  
Where mirth does never fail,  
And the jolly swain laughs his fill.  
  
I love the pleasant cot,  
I love the innocent bower  
Where white and brown is our pot  
Or fruit in the mid-day hour.  
  
I love the oaken seat,  
Beneath the oaken tree,  
Where all the old villagers meet,  
And laugh our sports to see.  
  
I love our neighbors all  
But — Mary — I better love thee  
And love them I ever shall,  
But thou art all to me.  
  
William
