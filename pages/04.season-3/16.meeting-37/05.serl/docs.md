##### To the Author of the Acrostic, and other Jeux d'Esprit, to Eliza

Oh whence that song, that tender dulcet strain  
&emsp;That seemed to breathe affection’s purest *fire*,  
Hark, hark, its pleasing magic wakes again  
&emsp;Again a master’s finger sweeps the lyre.  

Alas, too well that honied voice I know  
&emsp;Where flattering accents won my youthful heart  
Ah once to me those magic strains could flow  
&emsp;But now Eliza wakes their tuneful art.  

In vain in *transposition’s* apt disguise  
&emsp;Fearing detection, you your name conceal,  
Indignant love with more than mortal eyes  
&emsp;Can unretarded pierce the flimsy veil.  
 
What tho’ they Mary’s pallid cheek forlorn  
&emsp;May not the smile of Cytherea boast,  
As pure a smile did once my face adorn,  
&emsp;Ere smiles and happiness with thee were lost.  

Say could the fire that fills Eliza’s eyes  
&emsp;Compare with that which in my bosom glows  
’Tis coquetry that sparkling glance supplies,  
&emsp;Mine from affection’s purest fountain flows.  
 
Return, return, or from my youthful breast,  
&emsp;I’ll chase the image which I now adore,  
Till sweet oblivion gives my sorrows rest,  
&emsp;And thy loved name shall wake a sigh no more.  
 
Mary
