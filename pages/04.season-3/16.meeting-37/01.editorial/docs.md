The hearing of the cause Mars versus Mercury having been fixed for this Evening we are much concerned to state that the absence of the leading Counsel on the part of the Plaintiff, and also of our most noble Judge, obliges us to defer the Pleading. Our correspondents, presuming, as we imagine upon the trial have since our last meeting been unusually idle, and we must therefor claim the indulgence of our hearers for a less brilliant number than we have hitherto offered to their notice.

We shall read this Evening, the Protestation, 2 Sonnets to the Swallows of 1809, Verses to a Young Lady with a present of a Volume of Poems, Lines to the Author of the Acrostic to Eliza, Song written from a friend to his Wife, Verses to Celia, and new Pot pourri.

The Cambrian advertisement we propose as a model to those who may have the misfortune to lose a Cow.

The Restoration has advanced nother Canto and Albruno has marshalled his forces, but we are still in the dark as to the scene of action and the plot, that we hope will be hereafter unravelled.
