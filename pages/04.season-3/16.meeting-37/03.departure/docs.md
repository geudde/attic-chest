##### To the Swallows on their departure 1809  

Ye Birds that fearful of th’inclement skies  
&emsp;Now bid your straw-built summer seats adieu  
No Summer viewed you with propitious eyes  
&emsp;No days of warmth and splendour shined on you.  
 
To weep the fate of Europe, wat’ry Jove  
&emsp;The Earth has deluged with unceasing rain  
To dry the falling moisture Phoebus strove  
&emsp;And tho’ by Sirius aided, strove in vain.  
Athwart the skies was spread a dusky veil  
&emsp;That hid his glories from the toiling swains  
For months obscured in clouds, or wan and pale  
&emsp;He shed a sickly lustre on the plains.  

When next you come may he in slendour rise  
&emsp;And smile upon you from unclouded skies.
