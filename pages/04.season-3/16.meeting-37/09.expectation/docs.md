Now the mountain’s tow’ring steep  
In ev’ning Twilight fades away,  
And anxious hope her vigils keep  
Where Zama marks the closing day.  
  
Along the wide extensive main  
That bounds the turret walls so high  
Her wandering eye is stretched again  
Some distant white sail to descry.  
  
For oft had disappointment’s tear  
Bedew’d affection’s pallid cheek,  
At length the distant sails appear  
And nearer waves the vessel breaks.  
  
Yet ah not doomed to anchor there  
Tis gone! and leaves no trace behind  
Save where the moonbeam points out where  
The bliss of Hope illum’d her mind.  
  
As Zama watch’d the glitt’ring mast  
And fondly hop’d the vessel bore  
All that might recompense the past  
And her loved absent Lord restore.  
  
Again a distant speck appears,  
And Zama is deceived no more  
The Hero lives to chase her fears  
To say “We meet to part no more.”
