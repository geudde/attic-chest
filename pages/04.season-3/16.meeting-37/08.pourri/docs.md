Take thirty pounds of Common Sense; twenty pounds of sterling wit; fifteen pounds of Diffidence; add Learning and Discretion; it may not be amiss to throw a slice of Beauty into the Composition, not forgetting, however, to correct its Influence by an equal portion of Unaffectedness. A small quantity of Vanity will be requisite. Let it be remembered, though, that there are two sorts of Vanity. The one is that necessary sentiment which incites the mind to exertion by giving to it a consciousness of its Capabilities, and an idea of the Utility of its Attainments. The other knows no Stimulus but that which has its Origin in a Thirst for Admiration. It is, of course, unnecessary to say which of these two species of Vanity should be selected. A good Temper is an indispensable Ingredient.
