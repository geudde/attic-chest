As Gilead’s plant in every season gives  
&emsp;Its balmy fragrance to the ambient air  
And still continues, while its foliage lives  
&emsp;To shed its unexhausted perfume there.  
  
So may those charms, which in life’s early day  
&emsp;Please the chaste eye, and wake the feeling heart  
Continue still thro’ life’s protracted way  
&emsp;From youth to age, their virtues to impart.  
  
And when you wander thro’ the Muse’s page  
&emsp;Oh may my memory soothe your gentle breast  
Whether I still tread life’s long lingering stage,  
&emsp;Or in the peaceful tomb my ashes rest.  
  
W.C.
