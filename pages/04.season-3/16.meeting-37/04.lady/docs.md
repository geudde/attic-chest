As Gilead’s Plant in every season gives  
&emsp;Its balmy fragrance to the ambient air  
And still continues, while its foliage lives  
&emsp;To shed its unexhausted perfume there.  
  
So may those charms, which in life’s early day  
&emsp;Please the chaste eye, and wake the feeling heart  
Continue still thro’ Life’s protracted way  
&emsp;From Youth to Age, their virtues to impart.  
  
And when you wander thro’ the Muse’s page  
&emsp;Oh may my memory soothe your gentle breast  
Whether I still tread Life’s long lingering stage,  
&emsp;Or in the peaceful tomb my ashes rest.  
  
W.C.
