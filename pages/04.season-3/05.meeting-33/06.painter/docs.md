#### A Catholic Story  
  
There once was a painter in Catholic days,  
&emsp;Like Job, who eschewed all evil;  
Still on his madonnas the curious may gaze  
With applause & amazement, but chiefly his praise  
&emsp;And delight, was in painting the devil.  
  
They were angels compar’d to the devils he drew,  
&emsp;Who beseig’d poor St Anthony’s cell;  
Such hot burning eyes, such a d--nable hue,  
You could even smell brimstone, their breath was so blue,  
&emsp;He painted the devil as well.  
  
And now had the artist a picture begun,  
&emsp;’Twas over the Virgin’s church door;  
She stood on the dragon, embracing her son;  
Many devils already this painter had done,  
&emsp;But this must out do all before.  
  
The old dragon’s imps, as they fled thro’ the air,  
&emsp;At seeing it, paus’d on the wing;  
For he had the likeness so just to a hair  
That they came as if Apollyon himself had been there,  
&emsp;To pay their respects to their king.  
  
Ev’ry child at beholding it, shiver’d with dread,  
&emsp;And scream’d as he turn’d away quick:  
Not an old woman saw it, but, raising her head,  
Dropt a bead, made a cross on her wrinkles, and said,  
&emsp;“God help me from ugly Old Nick!”  
   
What the painter so earnestly thought on by day,  
&emsp;He sometimes would dream of by night:  
But once he was startled as sleeping he lay,  
’Twas no fancy, no dream — he could plainly survey  
&emsp;That the devil himself was in sight.  
  
“You rascally dauber,” old Beelzebub cries,  
&emsp;“Take heed how you wrong me again!  
Though your caricatures for myself I despise,  
Make me handsomer now in the multitude’s eyes,  
&emsp;Or see if I threaten in vain!”  
  
Now the painter was bold, and religious beside,  
&emsp;And on faith he had certain reliance:  
So, earnestly he all his countenance ey’d,  
And thank’d him for sitting, with Catholic pride,  
&emsp;And sturdily bade him defiance.  
  
Betimes in the morning the painter arose,  
&emsp;He is ready as soon as ’tis light;  
Ev’ry look, ev’ry line, ev’ry feature he knows,  
’Tis fresh in his eye, to his labor he goes,  
&emsp;And he has the wicked on quite.  
  
Happy man! He is sure the resemblance can’t fail,  
&emsp;The tip of his nose is red hot,  
There’s his grin and his fangs, his skin cover’d with scale,  
And that — the identical curl in his Tail,  
&emsp;Not a mark, not a claw is forgot.  
  
He looks, and retouches again with delight,  
&emsp;’Tis a portrait complete to his mind;  
He touches again, and again feeds his sight,  
He looks round for applause, and he sees with affright,  
&emsp;*The original* standing behind.  
  
“Fool! Idiot!” old Beelzebub grinn’d as he spoke,  
&emsp;And stampt on the scaffold in ire;  
The painter grew pale, for he knew it no joke,  
’Twas a terrible height, & the scaffolding broke,  
&emsp;The devil could wish it no higher.  
  
“Help! Help me! O Mary!” he cried in alarm,  
&emsp;And the scaffold sank under his feet:  
From the canvas the Virgin extended her arm,  
She caught the good painter, she sav’d him from harm;  
&emsp;There were thousands who saw, in the street.  
  
The old dragon fled, when the wonder he spied,  
&emsp;And curs’d his own fruitless endeavour;  
While the painter call’d after, his rage to deride,  
Shook his pallet & brushes in triumph, and cried,  
&emsp;“I’ll paint thee more ugly than ever!”
