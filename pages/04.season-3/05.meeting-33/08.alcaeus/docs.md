<div class="author">Mr Flaxman</div>

Infancy, youth and hoary age  
In dread unequal war engage  
With envy, falsehood deadly strife  
Whose ambush hunts down human life.   
Foul envy aims her rankling dart,  
False friendship cuts the generous heart  
And blood-stained strife for rule & gain  
Adds to the mind & body’s pain.  
Yet these can’t always surely kill  
The gods! the gods protect us still.

Fulvius Ursinus Graece, 1567
