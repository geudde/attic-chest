##### Translated from the Italian of Petrarch on the Death of Laura  
  
Fall’n is the pillar high, the laurel green,  
&emsp;That to my wearied thought erst gave a shade!  
Nor can by lands, by power, by India’s gems  
&emsp;By countless gold, my loss be e’er repaid.  
  
Death has destroy’d, what most my soul held dear;  
&emsp;The treasure that with rapture fill’d my mind;  
Now lost is that, which though to either pole  
&emsp;In weary search I roam, I ne’er shall find!  
  
But if stern destiny’s stern will it be,  
&emsp;Why flows complaint, why starts th’unbidden tear,  
Oh! life at first what charms in thee appear,  
&emsp;How gay thou art, how cheerful & how free,  
&emsp;Yet in one fatal morn, how oft we see  
Destroy’d, the soul of many a weary circling year.
