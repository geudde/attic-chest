Once more with many a sportive wile  
To sooth stern winter to a smile,  
The Attic troop will treat the stage  
Their mimic war again to wage.  
The daring knight who last year sought  
The inky conflict, and who fought  
Uncourtly wight! to draw the pen  
Against our sex, to favour men!  
Lysander once, but now a peaceful maid  
In her own needle work arranged  
Shunning the battle, and such rude disorders  
Shines like a comet in her bugle borders!  
With one fair hand she hold the ponderous shield  
The slender needle doth the other wield  
And like another Pallas, take the field  
  
Our nymphs turn shepherds, and on mirth intent  
For sister nymphs they flatteries invent  
They praise their eyes, sometimes their wit, and swear!  
By all that’s pretty! that they think them fair!  
And do the <span data-tippy="Gents" class="green">Swains</span> *ne’er* condescend to feign?  
Oh yes, and very well too, that is plain  
Sometimes forsooth philosophers and sages!  
Not gracing *this*, but very distant ages,  
But too impatient for the cheat to last  
They change the tense, to present, from the past.  
In short, we all take characters, or grave, or gay  
And pleased our prompter’s *hammer* all obey  
Our Editor the part of Prosp’ro takes  
And each quick spirit at his beck forsakes  
Its darling liberty in field or bower  
Flies at his call, and owns the magic power!  
  
Sage Anna comes, with *her* the dark-eyed maid  
And one, who frequent in seclusion’s shade  
Woos the fair Nine, nor unsuccessful woos,  
But shares the favour of each liberal Muse  
And once again with still renewed delight  
Comes constant Moth, in somber plumage dight  
 To perch upon the laurel bough  
 That shades her dearest Stella’s brow!  
   
Where all its woes shall be reliev’d,  
Its devious wanderings retriev’d,  
Its former oversights corrected,  
Its schemes from failure all protected,  
Where joy from sorrow’s lap shall spring,  
And disappointment drop her wing.  
  
In vain our fragrant sighs betray  
That sadness dwells with us today,  
Our own conviction we resist,  
On each frail, trivial, good insist  
Prove it will work some great event,  
And cheer our bosoms with content.  
  
Our drooping hearts, courting repose,  
Would some new bourne of peace disclose  
For scarce could duty make her way,  
But for sweet hope’s alluring ray.
