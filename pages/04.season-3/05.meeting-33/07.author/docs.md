<div class="author">Miss Porden</div>

Oh! why of memory complain?  
&emsp;Why weep her retrospective power?  
Oft has she <span data-tippy="cheered" class="green">smoothed</span> the bed of pain,  
&emsp;And oft beguiled the weary hour.  
  
Oft when with grief our hearts were filled,  
&emsp;Has she some social scene retraced,  
Till every vein with pleasure thrilled,  
&emsp;And lost the present in the past.  
  
What tho’ the rays at early morn  
&emsp;That gilt our path, have spent their force?  
What tho’ the brighter beams are shorn  
&emsp;That gladdened all our noontide course?  
  
The setting sun’s serener glance  
&emsp;With milder lustre gilds the shore,  
And crimson’s all the vast expanse,  
&emsp;Of that dread sea, we must explore;  
  
And as we stand upon its brink,  
&emsp;Although of many a joy bereft,  
Of many a friend, ’tis sweet to think  
&emsp;That still our truest friends are left.  
  
Tho’ flattering hope has oft deceived  
&emsp;With visionary joys our youth,  
To know, she now may be believed  
&emsp;While trusting in a saviour’s truth.  
  
As on the joys of yonder shore  
&emsp;Her glowing thoughts enraptured dwell,  
’Tis sweet to know its blessings more,  
&emsp;Than e’en seraphic hope can tell.
