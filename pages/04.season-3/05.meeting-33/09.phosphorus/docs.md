Since Phosphorus was the name of yore  
Which Cytheriaâ€™s planet bore  
The story *Arcite* has related,  
I think may be with ease translated.  
That Venus, angry when she viewed  
The plan the caitiff pair pursued,  
To bring to light those graceful arts,  
She taught, for winning heedless hearts.  
Swift from the blue aetherial bright,  
To Brighton winged her airy flight,  
And by these arts which they disdained,  
Their unsuspecting hearts enchained.
