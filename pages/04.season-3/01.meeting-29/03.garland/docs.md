Powers of Poetry descend!  
And to your humble Votary lend  
Your willing aid, and from your Bowers  
Bring me ever blowing Flowers,  
Cultur’d by the Muses’ care  
Gather’d from their bright Parterre  
At the foot of yonder Mountain  
Water’d by Castalian Fountain.  
Help me then ye Nymphs divine!  
And an Attic *Wreath* I’ll twine  
First for Bay and Laurel green  
Be Odes, and Epic Poems seen —  
Then fair Erato bring her Roses  
Ere each Bud its bloom discloses;  
And in the midst of these shall shine  
A leaf from Old Anacreon’s Vine.  
In coat of yellow streak’d with Red  
The gaudy Tulip lifts his head,  
Like him in garb of hues diverse  
Appears the Mock Heroic verse.
