Powers of Poetry descend!  
And to your humble Votary lend  
Your willing aid, and from your Bowers  
Bring me ever blowing Flowers,  
Cultur’d by the Muses’ care  
Gather’d from their bright Parterre  
At the foot of yonder Mountain  
Water’d by Castalian Fountain.  
Help me then ye Nymphs divine!  
And an Attic *Wreath* I’ll twine  
First for Bay and Laurel green  
Be Odes, and Epic Poems seen —  
Then fair Erato bring her Roses  
Ere each Bud its bloom discloses;  
And in the midst of these shall shine  
A leaf from Old Anacreon’s Vine.  
In coat of yellow streak’d with Red  
The gaudy Tulip lifts his head,  
Like him in garb of hues diverse  
Appears the Mock Heroic verse.

#### To the Fair Attics and the Attics who are not fair  
  
Brothers and Sisters of the Chest,  
The Wreath is yours, I’ve done my best  
’Tis true, my Pegasus is lame,  
Of course my verse must be the same:  
Another time a theme more humble  
Shall save us both, from many a stumble.

A vagrant flower found:   
  
Me thought I’d lost the Eglantine  
But here it is, A Valentine!  
  
Friendship’s Off’rings kind and true  
Will give the Am’ranth’s purple hue,  
And for the snowdrop’s pallid grace  
A mournful Elegy I’ll place.  
The simple Lay warm from the Heart  
Shall play the modest Violet’s part,  
Which tho’ unmark’d, unseen, may bloom,  
Gives to the sense its soft perfume.  
Nor Rue, nor Wormwood, shall be there  
But *Pensées* delicate and rare  
Such as are born of Ladies fiar,  
Shall spring and flourish ev’ry-where:  
And but I fear the Critics keen,  
Auld Coila’s flower I’d gladly glean.  
  
#### To the Muses  
  
Thanks gentle Ladies for your care  
Thanks for each fragrant Flower  
The Flow’rs are sweet, but Oh! I fear  
That each was much more sweet more fair  
When in its native soil and air  
And in you Classic Bower  
There wants a skilfull hand, a grace  
Such matchless flow’rs as yours to place.
