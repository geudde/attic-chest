#### The Complaint of the Members of the Attic Chest on the Delay of Opening it this Season

Now Brighton ev’ry Day grows thinner,  
The Black-Legs scarce get a Dinner,  
&emsp;The Steyne and Libraries are wond’rous Empty:  
Roques *there* who live upon their Wit  
Scarce once in ten times make Hit;  
&emsp;While Rogues *in Town* are revelling in Plenty!  
  
The Woods, the Fields, the Roads are muddy,  
Poor Nature’s quite in a Brown Study:  
&emsp;And Country Folks find winter fast approaches;  
Crowds flock to London ev’ry Day,  
And to the Ball, the Rout, the Play,  
&emsp;Incessant roll the countless Coaches!!  
  
To Whist, Quadrille and Evening Parties  
Folks run by Tens, by Scores, by Forties,  
&emsp;And scarce a Place but has some Windows lighted:  
But those who pace that lengthened Street,  
Where erst the Attic Guests were wont to meet,  
&emsp;But for the Lamps would surely be benighted!!!  
   
Indeed there long has been a Rumour,  
That Groans, the grumbling Groans of Humor  
&emsp;Have often lately issued from that Mansion;  
Others aver it is the Attic Spirits  
Complaining that her Customers great Merit  
&emsp;Is quite neglected for the Sake of Fashion.  
  
Each Attic Member thinks it strange,  
That as their Editress has had her Range,  
&emsp;And quite recovered from her Solar Journey:  
That she should now no more her Friends remember,  
Now that is just arrived the Month November,  
&emsp;<span data-tippy="November" class="green">The</span> glorious Month to Counsel and Attorney!  
  
When will return those happy Times,  
When Flaxman with his sparkling Rhymes  
&emsp;Shows he can animate Verse as well Blocks;  
When will again the Members meet,  
To taste again their Attic Treat  
&emsp;When will the Chest reope its long closed Locks!  
  
When shall we hear her dread Command,  
Who sits with Hammer in her Hand,  
&emsp;And *knocking Silence*, makes the greatest Noise;  
That Sceptre brought from India’s Shores,  
Which when the (female) vocal Thunder roars,  
&emsp;Frightens to good behaviour Girls and Boys.  
   
But when our Ears her Verses greet,  
They flow so witty, & so sweet,  
&emsp;We breathless bend to catch each word the while:  
And oft when some Poetic thought,  
Shines, fresh from Pindus Fountain brought,  
&emsp;E’en her kind Mentors grant th’ endearing Smile!!
