<span class="title">The Complaint of the Members of the Attic Chest on the Delay of Opening it this Season</span>

Now Brighton ev’ry day grows thinner,  
The Black-Legs scarce get a dinner,  
&emsp;The Steyne and libraries are wond’rous empty:  
Roques *there* who live upon their wit  
Scarce once in ten times make hit;  
&emsp;While rogues *in town* are revelling in plenty!  
  
The woods, the fields, the roads are muddy,  
Poor Nature’s quite in a brown study:  
&emsp;And country folks find winter fast approaches;  
Crowds flock to London ev’ry day,  
And to the ball, the rout, the play,  
&emsp;Incessant roll the countless coaches!!  
  
To whist, quadrille and evening parties  
Folks run by tens, by scores, by forties,  
&emsp;And scarce a place but has some windows lighted:  
But those who pace that lengthened street,  
Where erst the Attic Guests were wont to meet,  
&emsp;But for the lamps would surely be benighted!!!  
   
Indeed there long has been a rumour,  
That groans, the grumbling groans of humor  
&emsp;Have often lately issued from that mansion;  
Others aver it is the Attic Spirits  
Complaining that her customers great merit  
&emsp;Is quite neglected for the sake of fashion.  
  
Each Attic member thinks it strange,  
That as their Editress has had her range,  
&emsp;And quite recovered from her solar journey:  
That she should now no more her friends remember,  
Now that is just arrived the month November,  
&emsp;<span data-tippy="November" class="green">The</span> glorious month to counsel and attorney!  
  
When will return those happy times,  
When Flaxman with his sparkling rhymes  
&emsp;Shows he can animate verse as well blocks;  
When will again the members meet,  
To taste again their Attic treat  
&emsp;When will the Chest reope its long closed locks!  
  
When shall we hear her dread command,  
Who sits with hammer in her hand,  
&emsp;And *knocking silence*, makes the greatest noise;  
That sceptre brought from India’s shores,  
Which when the (female) vocal thunder roars,  
&emsp;Frightens to good behaviour girls and boys.  
   
But when our ears her verses greet,  
They flow so witty, & so sweet,  
&emsp;We breathless bend to catch each word the while:  
And oft when some poetic thought,  
Shines, fresh from Pindus fountain brought,  
&emsp;E’en her kind mentors grant th’ endearing smile!!
