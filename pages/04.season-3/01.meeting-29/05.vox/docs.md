Says the yellow hair’d laddie, to Luna so bright  
How comes it, our Mars is so favor’d a wight  
That the Attics are still to be held on his night?  
His deeds, or his trophies, can ne’er be deem’d fitting  
For fair ladies’ ears, who so silently sitting  
For love of the Muses, leave sewing and knitting;  
’Tis high time I protest that your claims you assert  
Let them know ’tis your wish — Come my girl be alert —  
Says Luna, with one they are afraid to be found  
For ’tis often asserted, when I appear round  
That the heads of your poets are not very sound!  
So I’ll not interfere — for I very well know  
They have settled their plan — and friend Mars is their beau,  
Yet never-the-less I must think my good Sir  
If Hermes the gay were to make a great stir  
They might listen to him — with very great reason;  
He also as being a <span data-tippy="lib’ral" class="green">thievish</span> divinity  
Might <span data-tippy="help the" class="green">steal for</span> Young Poets <span data-tippy="the" class="green">some</span> scraps of Latinity.  
His vigilance too, an assistance might prove  
To find out who is who — and then throw down the glove —  
At this speech, they all shouted, — when good Father Jove  
Shrugging up his broad shoulders — his eyes beaming Love  
Cries out, daughter Venus pray how haps it that you  
Lay no claim to your Night with these Mortals below?  
For such clever, such Beautiful Damsels attend,  
That believe me, sometimes I’ve a Mind to descend  
To behold and admire, but my consequence hingers,  
Nor would I, that a hair of their heads became Cinders;  
And <span data-tippy="my Wisdom" class="green">Pallas</span> advises me here to remain —   
From their mischievous Tricks, they would never refrain  
And to outwit me now, would my Character stain —  
But dear Venus, thou Goddess so fair and so free,  
Go among them, *incognito!* for then you will see  
What’s the mischief on foot — for between you and me  
I shrewdly suspect that at present they have got  
Of a Gnome, Sylph, and Nereid, some terrible Plot;  
And to bring it to bear, they won’t mind what they do,  
Tho the Damsel concern’d, is a favorite too;  
But the care shall be mine, to frustrate their intentions,  
I shall sprinkle some Powder shall spoil their Inventions;  
No Gnome shall she wed, and be dragg’d underneath  
Depriv’d of Fresh Air, and scarce able to Breathe,  
Nor shall she be hurried to Neren’s cold Bowers,  
But remain with her Friends, to enliven their hours,  
Till that youth shall arrive, who best Merits — but hush!  
Lest by naming him now, I should raise up a blush  
On the fair Maiden’s cheek — so dear Venus descend  
To protect this young virgin, and prove her true friend —   
Sage Venus — my care she shall be while on Earth,  
And ere I return, I will cause them some Mirth;  
For whilst I remain in fair Ellen’s gay Court  
Where the young Men and Maidens so frequent resort,  
I’m resolved spite of <span data-tippy="Prudence" class="green">Pallas</span> to show them some sport  
And by writings, and saying, and some merry looks  
I’ll distract e’en the gravest awhile from his Books —  
Now Old Saturn the Sly, from his corner remote,  
Cried suppose I disguise myself in my *Great Coat*  
And descend ’mong these Girls? — for with little exertion  
All grave as I seem, I would find them diversion  
For like Até of old, I would throw down an apple  
To possess it from me would occasion a Grapple  
A prize it might be, for their wit or their beauty  
But <span data-tippy="Prudence" class="green">Pallas</span> says leave out both <span data-tippy="wisdom" class="green">Prudence</span> and duty.  
No, no, no, cried the Goddess, quite in a rage,  
Such a gloomy old Fellow! — says Venus, I’d wage  
My Son’s Quiver, you soon wou’d be sent to the Pound,  
You had best mind your bus’ness, and keep in your *Round*  
Much Hubbub now followed, ’bout who should descend,  
When good Father Jove, their loud quarrels to end,  
And the better at once to gnash disputation,  
Resolved that each Planet remain in its station;  
Save Hermes alone — who so oft had been down  
No stranger was he to the Lasses in Town.  
Said Momus the merry — let me join the Fun,  
Oh, Oh, shouted all, they’ve a *Mime* of their own —  
Jove now shook his dark Locks, to establish his Fiat!  
Gods and Goddesses too, in a moment were quiet —  
Then to Hermes they whisper’d — should you be accepted  
We all beg and intreat we may not be neglected;  
But receive every month a good Packet of News —  
&emsp;And remember us kindly to each Sister Muse.
