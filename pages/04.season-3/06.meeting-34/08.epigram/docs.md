<span class="title">On the Death of the two famous Chinese Astronomers *Ho* and *Hi*</span>
  
Here rot the bones of *Ho* and *Hi*,  
Whose fate was sad, but risible,  
Being hang’d, because they could not spy  
Th’ eclipse, that was invisible!  
  
*Hi!* *Ho!* ’tis said, that too much drink  
Occasion’d all their trouble:  
But that can’t scarce be true, I think  
Since drunken folks see double!!
