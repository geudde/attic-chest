Say Love, what master shows thy art,  
&emsp;That sweet improver of mankind,  
Which warms with sentiment the heart,  
&emsp;With information hones the mind?  

Whence does the soul, disdaining Earth,  
&emsp;To ether wing its ardent way?  
Who gives the bold expression birth  
&emsp;That all its images convey?  

’Tis not to Greece’s learned soil  
&emsp;The world this happy culture owes  
Which not from Aristotle’s tail,  
&emsp;Nor yet from Plato’s fancy flows.  

Apollo and the tuneful Nine,  
&emsp;Attempt the envied song in vain;  
Their numbers are not so divine,  
&emsp;As is the lover’s tender strain!  

Scholastic art, the Muses’ lyres,  
&emsp;In vain their privileges boast;  
The love breathes a purer fire;  
&emsp;He sings the best who feels the most.  

No pow’r alone, and none below,  
&emsp;But thou, O love! can thee express;  
To thee, thy sentiments we owe,  
&emsp;To thee, we owe their glowing dress.  

Thou can’st refine the simple breast,  
&emsp;And to a poet raise a swain,  
His humble soul, by thee impress’d,  
&emsp;Assumes a warm exalted strain.  

His manners take a nobler turn;  
&emsp;His inspiration we descry;  
Upon his cheek we see it burn,  
&emsp;And speak, in lightning from his eye.  

With such a new, ideal store  
&emsp;Thy dictates fill the rustic mind,  
Such oratory shepherds pour,  
&emsp;They leave a Cicero far behind.  

Nay, such nice heights thy pow’r can reach,  
&emsp;With thee, such varied rhetoric dwells;  
That e’en the struggling, broken speech  
&emsp;The modelled period far excels.  

Thy silence oft, in striking pause  
&emsp;The lovers great ideas paints;  
Sublime conception is its cause;  
&emsp;The mind expands, but language faints.  

Free, uncompress’d, the thought appears,  
&emsp;Which words would awkwardly control,  
And nature hold our eyes, and ears;  
&emsp;We seem to hear, and see the soul.  

The letter’d youth let Plato’s page,  
&emsp;With generous sentiment inspire;  
I’m better taught than by a sage,  
&emsp;And catch a more etherial fire.  
 
A nobler and a speedier aid,  
&emsp;Receive I from *Eliza’s* Eyes;  
By them more happy I am made;  
&emsp;And as I’m happy, am I wise.  

Let the mistaken world suppose  
&emsp;That nature in Old Homer reigns;  
Or, still, more blindly think she flows  
&emsp;In Virgil’s cold, & labour’d strains.  

I came my Love upon a tree;  
&emsp;Scholars consult its faithful rind;  
Throw books away, for there you’ll see  
&emsp;A lovelier copy of the mind.
