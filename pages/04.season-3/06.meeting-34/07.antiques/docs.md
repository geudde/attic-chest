> From Schiller  

What the arts of Greece created  
Vainly has the Gaul translated  
&emsp;To the banks of Seine  
Let grand museums proudly boast  
The trophies of a plund’ring host,  
&emsp;The triumph is in vain.  
The Muse will frown on his endeavour  
Arms, never won her smiles or favour  
&emsp;The happy one alone  
Is of the heav’nly Muse possessed  
Who feels her in his glowing breast  
&emsp;To vandals, she is stone.  

C.M.
