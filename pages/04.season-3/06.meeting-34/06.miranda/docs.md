<div class="author">Miss Porden</div>

When sprightly spring with genial power  
Unbinds the chains of every flower  
And from the Earth with gentle hand  
Removes stern winter’s icy band  
With thee I roam the verdant vale  
With thee the freshning breeze inhale  
I pluck the vernal flowers for thee  
Too swiftly then the moments flee.  
  
When summer gaily smiling reigns  
With thee I quit the sultry plains  
In jasmine or in woodbine bowers  
With thee I pass the pleasing hours  
Or in some groves embowring shades  
While birds sweet carol o’er our heads  
I twine some roseate wreath for thee  
Too swiftly then the moments flee.  
  
When autumn crowned with corn appears  
And Earth a richer livery wears  
For thee the purple grapes I cull  
For thee the glowing nectarines pull  
With thee in sportive mood I come  
To grace the village harvest home  
And as I lead the dance — with thee  
So swiftly still the moments flee.  
  
And now tho’ winter rules the Bear  
Sweet friendship can the scene endear  
What tho’ no more with thee I rove  
To cull the flowers from dale or grove  
Yet friendship still my bosom warms  
And winter still for me has charms  
For while Miranda spent with thee  
Too swiftly still the moments flee.
