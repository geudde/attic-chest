##### From Deal Beach

Immortal *Poesy*! to thee  
In infant days I bow’d the knee,  
&emsp;And worshipp’d at thy shrine;  
While others adoration paid  
To *gold*, to *commerce*, to *parade*,  
&emsp;Thou hadst this heart of mine.  
 
By thee inspired, to me was dear,  
All Nature’s works, sublime or drear,  
&emsp;Or beautiful or fine;  
And when the forked lightnings flew,  
And thunders roll’d, and whirlwinds blew,  
&emsp;Charm’d was this heart of mine.  
 
E’en when the ship upheav’d on high  
Has scorn’d the waves and braved the sky  
&emsp;Or sunk deep gulfs between;  
While scowl’d the devastating blast  
Across the boundless wat’ry waste  
&emsp;I doted on the scene.  

Soon, too, celestial *Friendship’s* glow  
My ardent soul was doom’d to know  
&emsp;And *Love* still more divine  
Beat through my frame with heavenly thrill,  
And ruled imperiously at will,  
&emsp;This burning heart of mine.  

Thus tutor’d each fine throb to feel,  
No generous impulse to conceal,  
&emsp;The path of truth I trod  
I bow’d to Nature’s feelings true.  
Nor would those energies subdue,  
&emsp;Which came from *Nature’s God*  
 
And often on some mountain’s brow  
While the bright sun descending low  
&emsp;Crimson’d the western sky,  
And dusky evening’s gradual gloom  
Would sea, and land, and sky entomb  
&emsp;As Nature seemed to die.  

With her, my soul’s ador’d I’d rove  
When all was ecstasy, all love,  
&emsp;All glowing, great, divine;  
Thus school’d from *worldlings* far I flew,  
And every hour more soften’d grew  
&emsp;This wayward heart of mine.  
 
She ***died!*** in sorrow’s deepest gloom  
I bore her to an early tomb,  
&emsp;And wander’d far away,  
To other lands, and other seas  
I dragg’d a bosom ill at ease  
&emsp;And fill’d with dire dismay.  

Still *Poesy* romantic maid  
&emsp;My throbbing burning bosom sway’d,  
And still the *Lyre* divine  
Brought consolation on its wings,  
And as I touch’d the trembling strings  
&emsp;It cheer’d this heart of mine.  
 
Again each proud domestic joy  
&emsp;Drove far away all sad alloy  
And led my heart to know;  
My Jane! whose soul attun’d to taste,  
To all that’s wise, and great, and chaste,  
&emsp;Gives me a heaven below.  

Eight boys, and girls! our joy, our pride,  
&emsp;Celestialize our fireside  
And *Poesy* divine,  
Still mellows every hardship down  
And softens rude misfortune’s frown.  
&emsp;And charms this heart of mine.  

Seven years, my ***Jane!*** have fled away  
&emsp;Since from this beach to thee the lay  
I breath’d in musing mood;  
And still to ***thee***, to ***song***, and ***love***,  
I owe whate’er I can approve,  
&emsp;All that with me is good.  

And still o’er nature’s works I range,  
&emsp;With passion that can never change  
While ***memory’s*** tearful eye  
Doubles each past — each raptured view,  
And bids my soul again renew  
&emsp;Scene’s dear and long past by  

If oft on ocean’s briny side  
&emsp;In various lands where rolls the tide,  
The happiest hours I’ve known;  
With those, or dead, or distant far  
Still wake the warm, impressive tear;  
&emsp;At hours, forever flown!  

E’en now as by this sea-girt strand  
&emsp;I look across at ***Gallia’s*** land  
Mid prospects all divine;  
I feel the same ecstatic glow  
Which fir’d my bosom long ago,  
&emsp;And throbb’d this heart of mine.  

For twenty years attach’d to thee  
&emsp;To all that’s noble, great, and free,  
My ***Jane***, accept the line!  
Warm from a heart whose greatest boast  
However *rais’d, depress’d*, or *crossed*  
&emsp;Is, that, that ***Heart is Thine!***
