The sun was dilating his orb in the west;  
&emsp;And the season’s still mellowing charm,  
Diffus’d thro’ all Nature, was felt in my breast  
&emsp;And the breast became kindly and warm.  
&emsp;And must I then part from these objects so fair?”  
&emsp;In the pain of my spirit I said:  
But subduing the thought, I made haste to repair  
&emsp;To the cell where the *Convict* is laid.  
  
The thick-ribbed walls that o’ershadow the gate  
&emsp;Resound — and the dungeons unfold.  
I pause; and at length thro’ the glimmering grate  
&emsp;That outcast of pity behold.  
His black matted head on his bosom is bent,  
&emsp;And deep is the sigh of his breath:  
While with steadfast dejection his eye is intent  
&emsp;On the fetters that link him to Death!  
  
’Tis sorrow enough on that visage to gaze;  
&emsp;That body dismiss’d from his care:  
But my fancy has pierc’d to his heart, and portrays  
&emsp;More terrible images there.  
His bones are consum’d, and his lifeblood is dried  
&emsp;In wishes the past to undo;  
And his crime, thro’ the pain that o’erwhilm him descried  
&emsp;Still blackens and grows on his view.  
  
When from his dark synod, or blood-seeking field  
&emsp;To his chamber the *monarch* is led,  
All soothers of Sense their soft virtue shall yield  
&emsp;And silent attention his pillow shall head.  
If the less guilty convict a moment would lose,  
&emsp;And oblivion his tortures appease,  
On the iron that galls him his limbs must repose  
&emsp;In the damp dripping vault of disease.  
  
When full fain he would sleep, and has patiently tried  
&emsp;No longer his body to turn,  
And the iron that enters so deep in his side  
&emsp;Has enter’d too deep to be borne;  
While the jail mastiff howls at the dull clanking chain  
&emsp;From the roots of his hair there shall start  
A thousand sharp punctures of cold sweating pain,  
&emsp;And terror shall leap at his heart!  
  
But now he half raises his deep sunken eye,  
&emsp; And the motion unsettles a tear!  
It seems the low voice of despair to supply,  
&emsp;And asks of me, why am I here?  
Poor victim no idle intruder has stood  
&emsp;With o’erweening complaisance our states to compare:  
But one whose first wish is the wish to be good,  
&emsp;Is come as a brother thy sorrows to share.  
  
At thy name, tho’ compassion her nature resign,  
&emsp;Tho’ in virtue’s proud mouth thy report be a stain,  
My care if the arm of the mighty were mine,  
&emsp;Would plant there where yet thou might blossom again.  
Vain wish! yet misdeem not that vainly I grieve,  
&emsp;When vengeance has quitted her grasp on thy frame  
My pity thy children and wife shall reprieve  
&emsp;From the dangers that wait ’round the dwellings of shame.
