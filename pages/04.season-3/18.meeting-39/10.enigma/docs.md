##### 1st  
  
I am not tall, yet I am high  
I am not short, yet I am low,  
I cannot move, yet I can fly  
I cannot walk, yet I can go.  
  
##### 2d  
  
I am quite dumb, yet I can speak,  
And what must still excite your wonder  
I’m very strong tho’ I am weak  
And when I talk it is in thunder.  
  
##### 3d  
  
Huge is my mouth tho’ it is small  
Bulbous my snout like a potatoe  
And tho’ I have no foot at all  
I have a little and a great toe.  
  
##### 4th  
  
Ugly as sin and black as night  
I’m odious as the stubborn Jonas  
Yet fair as all the sons of light  
And lovely as the young Adonis.  
  
##### 5th  
  
My jaws are roomy like an oven  
Nay than a kitchen chimney wider  
And when I ope them you might shove in  
A hogshead full of ale or cider.  
  
##### 6th  
  
Six strapping youngsters call me sire  
And I’m the mother of a dozen  
Begot in air and born in fire  
And every one of them my cousin.  
  
##### 7th  
  
I march before a train of dames  
Majestic as a reverend gander  
And lead them all thro’ fire and flame  
Unhurt like an salamander.
