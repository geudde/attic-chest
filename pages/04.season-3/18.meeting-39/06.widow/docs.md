##### A Doctors’ Commons Tale founded on Facts  
 
Most *lawyers*, in the long vacation  
Pursue some fav’rite recreation,  
Their strength and spirits to recruit,  
And leave their clients and the suit.  
Oh! happy moment for the client,  
If adverse party be but pliant,  
To settle and adjust the cause,  
By equity, and not by laws;  
But quickly do it while you can  
Ere the *attorney* know the plan!  

&emsp;Thus *common lawyers* have some leisure,  
And full three months can take their pleasure;  
Yet they who wear the *civil gown*,  
The *proctors*, cannot leave the town:  
Call when you will, they’re never out,  
Grant *licences* the year throughout;  
Or *prove a will*, or else *administer* —   
And if your views are fair, not sinister,  
Their hopes so much in *suits* they centre,  
A *caveat* gladly will they enter.  
 
&emsp;A *widow* in the month of June,  
Though sure a widow much too soon,  
Fair, plump, and young — not twenty-seven  
Here husband scarcely got to Heaven —   
For only *nine* long days had passed  
Since the good man had breath’d his last,   
Come to consult her husband’s friend,  
To tell him that her heart would rend,  
To ask him what she had to do,  
For, as a *proctor*, well he knew,  
How to advise the widow best —   
To her the world was all a jest,  
She’d lost the man she held most dear —   
Her bosom heav’d — a swelling tear  
Fell on her breast — the proctor saw,  
He thought true grief, *without a flaw*;  
Though *widows* daily come to prove  
The *wills* of those they dearly love,  
Wishing, forgetting all that’s past,  
The man *to have his will at last*;  
Here was of sorrow such a store  
As would have serv’d five widows more.  

&emsp;The proctor sends his clerk away  
Judging she still had more to say:  
&emsp;My husband, sir, has made no will  
He knew his wishes I’d fulfill,  
For when alive, he never wanted,  
But instantly his wish was granted.  
*Administer*, they say, I must  
I am not, sir, *too late*, I trust?”  

&emsp;“*Too soon*, dear ma’am, by full *five* days,  
The court ne’er grants, tho’ widow *prays*,  
Till *twenty* days are gone and past,  
To see there be no will at last.”  
&emsp;Wait five days longer” cries the dame  
&emsp;I’m sure, sir, ’tis a burning shame,  
I thought *nine* days, to wait was plenty,  
Your court is mad, to make it twenty.”
