Kitty’s charming voice and face;  
&emsp;*Siren-like*, first took my fancy:  
Wit and humor next take place;  
&emsp;And now, I dote on sprightly Nancy.  

Kitty tunes her pipe in vain;  
&emsp;With airs most languishing and dying;  
Calls me false, ungrateful swain,  
&emsp;And tries, in vain, to *shoot me flying.*  

Nancy, with resistless art,  
&emsp;Always pleasant, gay and witty,  
Talk’d her dear self into my heart,  
&emsp;And quite excluded tuneful Kitty.  

Dear lovely maids, my fate’s so bad,  
&emsp;I must pursue some other matter;  
Kitty, you make me music mad,  
&emsp;You Nancy stem me with your chatter.
