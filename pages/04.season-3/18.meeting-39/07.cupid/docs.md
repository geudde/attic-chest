Ye Attic nymphs, ye Attic swains  
Inspired begin your vocal strains —   
In accents loud, in accents clear  
Charming the delightful ear  
Hail, oh hail, the first of May!  
Hail young Cupid’s natal day!  
  
Now Nature wears her mantle green  
And Earth put on her verdant screen  
The flowers in varied robes peep forth  
And fear no more the biting North  
But hail with joy the first of May  
The youthful Cupid’s natal day.  
  
Venus at his birth elate  
The powers invited to a fête  
And each to her in compliment  
To the young god some gift present.  
Then hail in many a sprightly lay  
The smiling Cupid’s natal day.  
  
Their golden points with venom fraught  
Apollo first his arrows brought  
His bow he unsuspecting gave  
Nor ever thought to be its slave  
Then joyful hail the first of May  
The youthful Archer’s natal day!  
  
On harmless turtles, and on sparrows  
The urchins first employed his arrows  
But bolder grown, at last began  
To fix their powerful points in Man  
Then hail, oh hail, the first of May  
Hail young Cupid’s natal day.  
  
This fame now spreading far and wide  
The sportive gods his power deride  
But all, he quickly doomed to feel  
Sharp pangs which Paeon could not heal  
No more they hailed the first of May  
The youthful Archer’s natal day.  
  
And in this month o’er all the rest  
He most assails the human breast  
And far most sure his arrows course  
When wit and beauty lend them force  
The oh beware the first of May  
The wily Archer’s natal day.
