<span class="title">To a lady distinguished by her dutiful attention to an aged parent</span>

&emsp;Ah! why has Nature with a wayward hand  
Cast on yon pathless rock that blushing rose  
&emsp;But to the dews of heaven its leaves expand  
But to the vagrant gales its scents disclose  
Unseen it droops its unsupported head,  
And strews with silken leaves a flinty bed.

&emsp;But see, my Anna, how that hoary oak  
Its ample arms it heaves amidst the skies  
&emsp;See, from its own paternal branches shook,  
Beneath its shade, a sapling kindred rise  
Its sacred head their filial boughs defend,  
While struggling trees the winter tempests rend.

&emsp;Thus gently Anna sinks the aged breast  
As ardour flags and human visions cease,  
&emsp;When sooth’d by dutious arts like thine to rest  
High-favor’d few that thus decline to peace!  
No pious praise of saints nor holy prayer  
As scenes like this to heav’n is half so dear.
