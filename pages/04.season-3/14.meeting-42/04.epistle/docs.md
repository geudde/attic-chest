O! think not Maria, while distant I prowl  
&emsp;That I bear thee no longer in mind  
Not such is the make of thy Father’s fond soul  
Which since he possess’d it, has known no control  
&emsp;But feelings all tender and kind.

There’s magic Maria in *names* that we prize  
&emsp;And the sound of some letters alone  
Will throb in the bosom and stream in the eye,  
As *memory* events that are long-lost supplies  
&emsp;And scenes that for ever are flown.

Such, such is thy name dear Maria to me  
&emsp;For early in life, e’er its woes  
Had bruis’d and assailed this susceptible heart  
She who bore it, occasion’d its every smart  
&emsp;And made or destroyed its repose.

She taught me affection, and friendship, and love  
&emsp;And gave to my bosom a charm  
It raised me each selfish sensation above  
(For in truth she was tender and soft as the dove)  
&emsp;And led me from error and harm.

All heaven was in this! but it spoilt me, my dear  
&emsp;And made me unfit for this earth,  
For my passions were ardent, were true and sincere  
And I loved far, far more sensibility’s tear  
&emsp;Than splendour and riches, and mirth.

Thus biass’d, as life had commenced its bright day  
&emsp;With Maria was coupled each joy;  
To my every happiness she led the way  
Without her, e’en *Nature* herself look’d not gay  
&emsp;And with her there was not alloy.

Say then my loved girl bearing this dearest name  
&emsp;My daughter, my boast and my pride  
To my comfort thus link’d, to my joy and my fame  
How *doubly* thou hast to my bosom a claim  
&emsp;Thus by sympathy fondly allied.

At this moment O! how would thy presence delight  
&emsp;While on Freedown’s delicious assent  
The gay coast of Gallia gladdens the sight  
And boldly the Fareland extends to the sight  
&emsp;To the left, all the beauties of Kent.

Below in the Downs a forest behold  
&emsp;Of ships, from each climate and land  
While alternately tinged with azure and gold  
The Channel rolls sparkling, extensive and bold  
&emsp;And the spreading sail glides ’long the strand.
  
The sun is declining, the glad shepherd boy   
&emsp;To the valley is driving his sheep  
To pen them secure from attack or annoy  
And around us is heard the cricketer’s joy  
&emsp;As skillful their stations they keep.

At a distance beneath, the spire ’bove the trees  
&emsp;And the farm at the bottom appear  
While the loaded team bounds o’er the grattan with ease  
And the farmer returning, exultingly sees  
&emsp;His Harvest Lane now very near.  

Thus as every beauty by sea and by land  
&emsp;Enraptures this bosom of mine;  
I pour out my soul, lov’d Maria to *thee*  
Regretting alone thou art not here to see  
&emsp;All that’s beautiful, grand and sublime.  

Farewell! to your Brothers and Sisters so dear  
&emsp;All that’s kind and affectionate say  
And to her, whom he cannot but ever severe  
To our Mother, our Wife, and our Friend, most sincere,  
For amid all our pleasure is still mix’d a tear  
&emsp;That the best belov’d is away.
