<div class="author">Communicated by Miss F. Richardson</div>

To galloping or ambling measure,  
&emsp;Awake, my lazy-footed Muse,  
And once more claim from Fancy’s treasure,  
&emsp;The privilege to pick and choose.

Revive my long-suspended power  
&emsp;With thy illuminating gleams,  
Give inspiration to this hour,  
&emsp;With rolling eye and frenzied dreams.

Or should your Museship be dejected,  
&emsp;Which so invoked is no new case,  
The smallest boon won’t be rejected,  
&emsp;However trite or common place.  

Novel ideas in pretty jingle  
&emsp;At least I claim, for friendship’s sake,  
Such themes as make fine ears to tingle  
&emsp;And nervous heads perchance to ache.

Sometimes in scientific rhymes  
&emsp;Art’s mysterious tenets show,  
Tell a tale of other times  
&emsp;Or fabricate a scene of woe.

Print modern manners as they pass,  
&emsp;Tell anecdotes both strange and rare,  
To Folly’s children hold a glass,  
&emsp;And catch the fool who turns to stare.

Let not the rout’s gay heedless throng  
&emsp;Staring, elbowing, and squeezing,  
With skipping dance, and screaming song  
&emsp;Which wear the legs and bring a wheezing.

E’er be forgot — but flow’rets bring,  
&emsp;From Heliconia’s fertile spring,  
To aid description’s graphic tongue  
&emsp;And sublimize this theme unsung.

Supposed arrived the hallowed hour  
&emsp;Of midnight, when on Nature’s plan  
Somnus alone should show his power,  
&emsp;And wrap in slumbers drowsy man.

To violate such needful rest  
&emsp;The tyrant fashion oft bears sway  
And dizened out, or half undressed  
&emsp;Her votaries calls to revelry.

Then o’er the stones the coaches rattle  
&emsp;The flambeaux blaze the streets along  
The *Gemmens* grin, the ladies prattle,  
&emsp;And all is bustle, buzz and throng.

Now jostling thro’ the lighted hall  
&emsp;With powdered lackeys ranged around  
Music proclaims the inspiring ball,  
&emsp;And toes fantastic shake the ground.

Then on the mazy winding stairs  
&emsp;Assemble all the motley train,  
Who substitute for graces, airs  
&emsp;And prove of shadows they are vain.

Painted belles and smiling beaux  
&emsp;Like Turkey figs are wedged together,  
Who to each other paint the woes  
&emsp;Of dirty streets, and foggy weather.

Sometimes in Scandalorum Mag  
&emsp;By way of stimulus to chat  
They let their tongues at random wag  
&emsp;Rejoicing that they smell a rat.

Cries one, I hate those would-be girls,  
&emsp;Like Madam there, with that vain fop;  
Her teeth that seem like precious pearls,  
&emsp;Are spic-span new from Spence’s shop.

Oh, cries a witling, prithee see,  
&emsp;Yon little clumsy, awkward form,  
That smiles with such affected glee,  
&emsp;As conscious all the world to charm.

For laughing I can scarcely speak,  
&emsp;Such frights description’s art defies,  
To see the poppies from her cheek  
&emsp;Have mounted to her vacant eyes.

Miss T., they say, is en bon point,  
&emsp;But then so local is her fat,  
That all her friends together join,  
&emsp;To say she’s dropsied, and all that.

Yet still they own she’s passing fair,  
&emsp;Although of late so wondrous big  
And much would praise such beauties rare,  
&emsp;Did she not paint and wear a wig.

Thus scandal reigns — and oft we find  
&emsp;The daughter apes her prating mother,  
To see demerit — all are blind,  
&emsp;And one fool ridicules another.
