Blue Beard

<div class="author">Miss F. Richardson</div>

1

There dwelt ’tis said in days of yore  
(We vouch not that the tale is true)  
A fell magician of great pow’r  
With hideous mien and Beard of Blue.

2

His house was stately to behold  
And gay and wide his gardens grew  
His plates and dishes were of gold  
Yet all could see his Beard was Blue.

3

Around him many a lady fair  
There dwelt, right comely to the view,  
But none would to his hall repair  
They dreaded so his Beard of Blue.

4

Yet was he hated most I ween  
Because the neighbors round him knew  
His mind was hideous as his mien  
His heart was black, his Beard was Blue.

5

To be his bride each damsel fear’d  
Because a rumour round there flew  
That soon and strangely disappear’d  
All who had wedded Beard of Blue.

6

Now one grand lady there dwelt near  
(The mother of fair daughters two)  
And this same lady lent no ear  
To what was said ’gainst Beard of Blue.

7

The daughters were their mother’s pride  
The charms did all men’s hearts subdue  
And one was asked for as his bride  
By this said monster Beard of Blue.

8

The damsels they did both agree  
That whichsoever he should woo  
They neither ‘ere would married be  
To one who had a Beard of Blue.

9

Yet still they both were so well bred  
They told him not the reason true  
But each her sister wish’d she said  
To marry with this Beard of Blue.

10

To gain his suit he’s so intent  
He ask’d the dame and daughters two  
To be his guests, and they consent  
In spite of his long Beard of Blue.

11

Now to his castle they repair’d  
Where wealth and pomp no medium knew  
And soon the youngest nymph declar’d  
“His beard was not so *very* blue.”

12

This charge the fell magician found  
His suit with zeal he did renew  
And soon in marriage ties came bound  
The youngest maid and Beard of Blue.

13

The honeymoon was nearly done  
Her chain the nymph did not yet rue  
Her lady mother home was gone  
And left the bride and Beard of Blue.

14

Now Blue Beard to his wife did say  
“I’ll leave you for a day or two  
For bus’ness calls me far away”  
A merchant was this Beard of Blue.

15

“And while I am away my dear  
You ev’ry pleasure may pursue  
Your friends I pray invite them here”  
So spake the might Beard of Blue.

16

“This key my wardrobe will unfold  
This brings my jewels to your view  
This locks my plate of burnish’d gold”  
Thus vaunted on this Beard of Blue.

17

“And you’ve the key of every room  
But this of brilliant sapphire hue  
On this one key depends your doom”  
He said, and shook his Beard of Blue.

18

“Into the lock ne’er put the key  
For dire misfortune will ensue  
Obey in this, in all else free”  
So spake the haughty Beard of Blue.

19

Soon as her spouse depart she sees  
The lady (as allow’d to do)  
Invites her friends and shows the keys  
Just giv’n to her by Beard of Blue.

20

Now thro’ the rooms each guest descends  
And some with envy look askew  
While some said nought could make amends  
For that same hideous Beard of Blue.

21

But our fair lady little heeds  
The pleasures which her friends pursue  
So much she ponders on and dreads  
The charge pronounc’d by Beard of Blue.

22

Yet still she greatly longs to know  
Why she’s forbid this room to view  
“If she had thought he’d use her so  
She not have wedded Beard of Blue.”

23

Sad restless curiosity  
Which brings effects we often rue  
Makes her more wish *that* room to see  
Than all the *rest* of Beard of Blue.

24

With trembling hands the key she takes  
The fatal lock she puts it thro’  
While thunder the apartment shakes  
And all the lights at one *burn blue*.

25

Appall’d with fear the lady stood  
While flitting shades around her flew  
Whose garments were besmear’d with blood  
The shades of wives to Beard of Blue.

26

Afraid to move she long did stand  
And still more faint and faint she grew  
The fatal key dropped from the hand  
Of the last spouse of Beard of Blue.

27

At last reviving by degrees  
She shut the door and quick withdrew  
When looking on the key she found  
To blood was chang’d its sapphire hue!

28

She tried to wash the stains away  
But as she tried more deep they grew  
This key was given by a fay  
A wicked friend of Beard of Blue.

29

Now as ill luck would have it so  
Quite unexpected homeward drew  
Her dreadful spouse; and she must go  
To welcome home great Beard of Blue.

30

“Right welcome home, my lord,” she cried  
“This quick return I look’d not to”  
“I’m glad it gives you joy,” replied  
With doubting accent, Beard of Blue.

31

“And now return me back the keys.”
The lady pale with terror grew  
Her fright with frowns her husband sees  
“What ails you?” thunder’d Beard of Blue.

32

“This terror looks like guilt” (quoth he)  
“If my suspicions are not true  
Then quickly give me back the key  
That key beset with jewels blue”

33

All stain’d with blood she gave the key  
And pale as ashes was her hue  
“Whence came these drops of blood I see?
You’ve ope’d the door,” said Beard of Blue.

34

Now for because you’ve disobey’d  
The solemn charge I gave to you  
Your life must be the forfeit paid  
So fate decrees,” cried Beard of Blue.

35

“And must I die,” she said in tears,  
“Then let me this small favor sue  
Grant me some time to say my prayers”  
“Well be it so,” said Beard of Blue.

36

Now when he’d left her to her prayers  
She calls her sister her unto  
And “Ann,” she cries, “pray run upstairs  
Oh save me from dread Beard of Blue.”

37

“For he will take my life today  
Then sister look if you can view  
My brothers riding by for they  
Were soon to visit Beard of Blue.”

38

Her sister to the window hies  
And short the time of respite grew  
Oh! see you nothing, Ann,” she cries  
“Come down, I say,” cries Beard of Blue.

39

“What see you, Anna,” now she cries  
“A cloud of dust obstructs my view”  
The trusty sister she replies  
To the last wife of Beard of Blue.

40

“Oh sister take another peep  
What caus’d the dust descried by you”  
“Alas ’twas but a flock of sheep”  
“I’m coming up,” cries Beard of Blue.

42

“What see you yet, dear sister say”  
“Two horsemen now appear in view  
And onward fast they speed their way  
Towards the gates of Beard of Blue.”

43

“They are my brothers I’ve no doubt”  
And hope now in her bosom grew  
Just as she finish’d she’s dragg’d out  
By the rude hand of Beard of Blue.

44

Now Blue Beard drags her down the stairs  
And o’er her head his sword he drew  
When lo each brother quick appears  
Before the ruthless Beard of Blue.

45

A guilty fear his soul appals  
He flies but quickly they pursue  
Then loudly to his slaves he calls  
To aid their master, Beard of Blue.

46

His rascals quickly round him swarm’d  
And all attack these brothers two  
Albeit they were both unarm’d  
Yet fear’d they not this Beard of Blue.

47

While one did ev’ry slave withstand  
The other near to Blue Beard drew  
Struck the sword from the tyrant’s hand  
And with that sword struck Beard of Blue.

48

The slaves who saw the wond’rous sight  
All quickly down their weapons threw  
Nor mourn’d the issue of the fight  
For no one lov’d fierce Beard of Blue.

49

The lady with her fear half dead  
Could scarce believe her senses true  
Or think she’d nothing more to dread  
From the vile threats of Beard of Blue.

50

But when the tyrant’s head she found  
She thank’d her valiant brothers two  
And hard before her on the ground  
Fell all the slaves of Beard of Blue.

51

Their homage could not change her heart  
Nor fail’d she in requital due  
Into four lots she strait did part  
The wealth immense of Beard of Blue.

52

A quarter of the wealth receives  
Each of her valiant brothers two  
To Anna the third portion gives  
The widow’d wife of Beard of Blue.

53

Soon Anna weds a valiant youth  
Who long her favor did pursue  
His only wealth was love and truth  
Far diff’rent he from Beard of Blue.

54

And many a knight whose secret love  
As yet constrain’d did lie perdue  
By valiant deeds now sought to move  
The former spouse of Beard of Blue.  

55

And one among the number came  
A youth right noble brave and true  
This youth did woo and win the dame  
The relict fair of Beard of Blue.

56

The story to conclusion brought  
Think when you read it o’er anew  
What useful lesson may be taught  
By these *exploits* of Beard of Blue.

57

To gratify her curious mind  
What perils she upon her drew  
Brought to the verge of death we find  
The prying spouse of Beard of Blue.

58

The cruel here are warn’d no less  
(But such I hope are none of you)  
And when they others would oppress  
Let them remember Beard of Blue.
