Oft I’ve implor’d, but all in vain!  
No Muse descends to guide my pen;  
Else would I hail thy natal hour  
In lofty verse, with all my power;  
Poetic flowers I would entwine  
A birthday wreath to make  
The lily pure, the rose divine  
The sweet briar and eglantine  
And all for Ellen’s sake.

The Rose I’d fancy was her lip,  
The bright-brown musk flower her hair,  
Then from dear truth I’d take a trip,  
And say her skin’s the lily fair.  
At this I blush, and fret, and pine,  
And throw my idle pen away;  
Vowing no flatter of mine,  
(Unworthy of the tuneful Nine)  
Shall taint her on her natal day.

Be this fair day still set apart,  
To love & friendship given;  
With virtuous thoughts, to fill her heart,  
And point her way to heaven.

“Beauty, like flowers, will soon decay,  
Wisdom can never perish;  
Some graces time will steal away,  
But some t’will nobly cherish;  
Tho’ time wills steal the rose of youth  
The mind may still be vernal;  
Increase of years but strengthen truth  
And virtue is eternal”
