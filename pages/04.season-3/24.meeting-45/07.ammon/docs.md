When Ammon’s mighty son arose  
Scattering wide fair freedom’s foes  
He spared the house where Pindar sung  
Where his lyre symphonious rung.  
Gods and god-like men his theme  
And in the inspired poetic dream  
Attuned to the harmonious  
Sounding silver string,  
Quenched the lightenings of the eagle’s eye  
And caused his flagging wing,  
Lulled in soft slumbers  
By the sceptred hand of Jove  
In the full synod  
Of the gods above.

But when commissioned with the high behest  
Instant he quits the balmy rest.
With out-stretched neck  
He wings his rapid flight  
Darts thro’ the gathering storm  
And spurns the blackening night.  

Returning to the skies  
He mingles in the sun’s far blazing beams  
And sails delighted  
Midst the golden streams  
Rejoicing in the aethereal courser’s race  
In the celestial light shoot on with equal pace.

Such be thy flight in lofty verse  
That heroes may thy song rehearse,  
So be thy eagle vision fixed above  
That thy repose be by the throne of Jove.

J. F.
