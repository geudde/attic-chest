A truce is agreed, by sylphs, kelpies, and gnomes,  
And all hie away to their different homes,  
Some dance in the sunbeams, and some on the waves  
While others descend to their primitive caves.  
The warfare is over, each sprite of the air  
Returns to his duty, attending the Fair,  
It need not be asked, where Sir Ariel is going  
Or to what favored maid his attentions are owing,  
His pinions cerulean no doubt will be spread,  
In lieu of a veil, o’er an uncovered head!  
Like a true knight he flies to the damsel’s relief  
As he was the innocent cause of her grief.  
And tho’ he no injury meant her, ’tis true  
Yet attention and kindness he feels are her due.  
The office is pleasing, the danger much less,  
Than fighting her battles, her wrongs to redress.

Ye butterfly warriors, ye guardins delightful  
Oh keep us from gnomes, and from everything frightful  
From kelpies tho’ riding in waterproof coaches  
From danger, and mischief, howe’er it approaches,  
For since we have heard of some wonderful tales  
We’re extremely alarmed for our hearts, and our veils.  

The sylphs I am told have engagements in view  
And the Muses determine to rusticate too.  
Now all are with rural felicity smitten  
The cards of congee are all speedily written  
And off go the coaches, post-chaises, and gigs  
The portmanteaux & band-boxes, baskets & wigs.  
But wherever we stray beneath heaven’s wide cope  
“Au revoir!” is our watch-word, our motto, & Hope.

But where shall thy lyre, my dear Stella be hung?  
Or rather afresh should that lyre be strung  
To valour and Beauty thy song still resound  
And friendship & love in they verses be found.  

Away from the smoke of the town for awhile  
In scenes more congenial the hours beguile

Beneath Jove’s tree shall be her bower  
Adorned with many a fragrant flower,  
Each emblematic evergreen,  
Shall form a rich umbrageous screen;  
And high the clustering leaves among  
Be every bird of sweeter song.  
And many a mystic form shall glide  
Around that spot at evening-tide  
Spirits of earth, of fire, of air!  
Of knights, and steeds, and ladies fair!  
And fairy minstrels too shall sing,  
From flowers that round her seat shall spring  
While o’er the moon-enlightened glade  
Shall flit the champion of the maid  
Her Glendower, her own true knight  
Her guardian sylph, her faithful sprite!
