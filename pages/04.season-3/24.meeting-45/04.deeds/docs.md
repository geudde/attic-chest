Let others sing of deeds of arms  
Of lovers’ joys or love’s alarms  
I choose a milder, better lay,  
And sing of Ellen’s natal day.  
That morning rose in splendor bright  
On which her eyes first view’d the light  
Aurora deck’d in Tyrian hues  
Foretold the richness of her Muse.  
The day pass’d on without a cloud  
Foretold her mind — serene and good  
The evening came — the lustrous spheres  
The brightness told, of future years  
And oh my Ellen may they be  
Prophetic still of *good* to *thee*.
