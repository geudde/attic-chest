Hail to the nymph well beloved by the Muses  
Honoured and blest by their favor divine  
Long may the fire that their love infuses  
Her bosom encharm and her senses refine  
&emsp;&emsp;Heaven send her happy dew  
&emsp;&emsp;On Earth long health renew  
&emsp;&emsp;Gaily to flourish and sweetly to bloom  
&emsp;&emsp;While every vale and glen  
&emsp;&emsp;Sends back our shout again

Ellena Attica Viva Allegra

Long may our Ellen still sip at their fountain  
May she bloom in the spring nor in winter e’er fade  
And tho’ whirlwinds may strip every leaf on the mountain  
May she ever find peace in their fostering shade  
&emsp;&emsp;Moor’d on the eternal rock  
&emsp;&emsp;Proof to the tempest’s shock  
&emsp;&emsp;Virtue and truth her firm shield still shall prove  
&emsp;&emsp;And every tongue will then  
&emsp;&emsp;Echo her praise again

Ellena Attica Viva Allegra

Proudly shall our song the joy of this day prolong  
That to Ellen gave birth and the Muses more smiles  
And Oh may the rose bud bloom, ripen, and ere long  
Be known and be loves as a grace of our isles  
&emsp;&emsp;Heaven send her happy dew  
&emsp;&emsp;On Earth long health renew  
&emsp;&emsp;Gaily to flourish and sweetly to bloom  
&emsp;&emsp;Loudly shall Clan Attic then  
&emsp;&emsp;Ring from her deepmost glen
