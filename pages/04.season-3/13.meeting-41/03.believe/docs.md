> Tune: “The White Cockade”

Believe me love, I’ll never change  
Whate’er may tempt where’er I range  
And tho’ much fairer maids there be  
Still thou shall fairest seem to me.  
I’ll watch thee with the tend’rest care  
Thy joys, thy woes, thy pleasures share  
Those eyes of thine shall never see  
One look of coldness come from me.

And wilt thou promise me thy love  
Wilt each opposing bar remove  
And tho’ one wealthier seek thy hand  
Wilt thou for me that wealth withstand?  
I ask but thee nor part for gold,  
Such charms should ne’er be bought or sold,  
And woulds’t thou but thy heart resign  
No earthly bliss should equal mine.
