Alas! in vain my Stella sings  
The power of my “Emerald Wings”.  
Those “Emerald Wings” are changed to lead,  
The spirit of thy Moth is fled,  
No more on wanton pinions gay  
I flutter in the noontide ray  
Or hover with a fond delight  
Around the taper’s treacherous light.

Say not that “Magic’s reign is o’er,”  
Its power I even now deplore;  
By some enchantment’s spell I’m bound  
And vainly strive to quit the ground.  
Oh bid my charmed senses wake;  
Teach me the potent spell to break.  
For dullness claims me for her own  
And chains me to her icy throne.  
Break thou my bonds and set me free  
I fain would take my flight with thee.  
&emsp;And shouldst thou Stella feel inclined  
&emsp;To mount upon the clouds or wind  
&emsp;Oh stop! and take me up behind!
