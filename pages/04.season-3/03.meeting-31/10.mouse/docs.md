<div class="author">Communicated by Mrs Porden</div>

Stay little tim’rous beastie, stay;  
Nor bicker wi sick speed away;  
For I, like some relentless fae,  
&emsp;Seek not they life,  
To scatter want, distress, and wae  
&emsp;’Mong weans and wife.  
    
At this bleak season o’ th’ year;  
When snows are deep, and frost severe,  
Does hunger fore thee out to speer  
&emsp;Thy scanty fare?  
Or is’t the folks at home to cheer,  
&emsp;That’s now thy care?  
  
It may be in some cozy biel,  
They’re waiting for their stinted meal,  
Whelk aiblins ye’ll be forc’d to steal  
&emsp;Frae barn or byre;  
And in the act Death’s tortures feel,  
&emsp;Frae Cats or wire.  
  
Ere nature’s bound in icy chains,  
Or feather’d Sangsters cease their strains  
Or Belles or Beaux wi Muffs and canes,  
&emsp;Abroad appear;  
Ye shud exert your nib’ling pains,  
&emsp;For winter drear.  
  
When Fahrenheit’s saxteen degrees  
Aneath the point where fluids freeze,  
Ye shud na hae sic tow to teaze,  
&emsp;Sae far frae hame;  
Whare may be sits, but ill at east,  
&emsp;Your sullen dame.  
  
If sic be your untoward fate,  
I wot ye’ll nae be lag nor blate;  
For nature’s laws, just oporate  
&emsp;On mice like men;  
Besides it’s now becoming late,  
&emsp;The clock’s struck ten.  
  
Come then ye daft and thriftless crew  
And in this mousely mirror view  
Yoursel’s displayed in colours true  
&emsp;Wi aw your pride;  
Wi boasted human reason too,  
&emsp;Your steps to guide.  
  
O man to many ills a prey  
Wi tot’ring steps and haffats gray,  
To close in want lif’s chequer’d day,  
&emsp;Is sad indeed,  
For eild alane soon wears away  
&emsp;The brittle thread.  
  
Then learn, ere hirplin eild appears,  
Where Friendship oft a coldness wears,  
That fills the aged e’en wi Tears,  
&emsp;The heart wi woe;  
To live so, that the closing years  
&emsp;Nae lack may know.
