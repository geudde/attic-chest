<span class="title">While His Nose Was Boring</span>

<div class="author">Communicated by Mr Vignoles</div>

Hark! hark! that pig — that pig! the hideous note,  
&emsp;Most loud, more dissonant, each moment grows —  
Would we not think, the knife was in his throat?  
&emsp;And yet they’re only boring thro’ his nose.  
  
Thou foolish beast, so rudely to withstand  
&emsp;Thy master’s will, to feel such idle fears!  
Why, pig, there’s not a lady in the land  
&emsp;Who has not also bor’d and ring’d her ears.  
  
Pig! ’tis they master’s pleasure — then be still,  
&emsp;And hold your nose to let the iron through —  
Dare you resist your lawful sovereign’s will?  
&emsp;Rebellious swine! you know not what you do?  
  
To man o’er every beast the power was giv’n;  
&emsp;Pig, hear the truth, and never murmur more!  
Wou’d you rebel against the will of heav’n?  
&emsp;Thou impious beast, be still! and let them bore!  
  
The social pig resigns his nat’ral rights  
&emsp;When first with man he convenants to live;  
He barters them for safer sty delights,  
&emsp;For grains and mash, which man alone can give.  
  
Sure is provision on the social plan,  
&emsp;Secure the comforts that to each belong:—  
Oh! happy swine! th’ impartial sway of man  
&emsp;Alike protects, the weak pig and the strong.  
  
And you resist! you struggle now, because  
&emsp;Your master has thought fit to bore your nose!  
You grunt, in flat rebellion to the saws  
&emsp;Society finds needful to impose!  
  
Go to the forest, piggy, and deplore  
&emsp;The miserable lot of savage swine!  
See how the young pigs fly from the great boar,  
&emsp;And see how coarse and scantily they dine.  
  
Behold their hourly danger, when who will  
&emsp;May hunt or snare or seize them for his food!  
Oh! happy pig! whom none presumes to kill  
&emsp;Till your protecting master, thinks it good!  
  
And when, at last, the closing hours of life  
&emsp;Arrives (for pigs must die as well as man)  
When in your throat you feel the long sharp knife  
&emsp;And the blood trickles to the under pan;  
  
And when, at last, the death wound yawning wide,  
&emsp;Fainter and fainter grows th’ expiring cry,  
Is there no grateful joy, no loyal pride,  
&emsp;To think that for your master’s Good you die?
