#### While His Nose Was Boring

<div class="author">Communicated by Mr Vignoles</div>

Hark! hark! that pig — that pig! the hideous note,  
&emsp;Most loud, more dissonant, each Moment grows —  
Would we not think, the knife was in his Throat?  
&emsp;And yet they’re only boring thro’ his nose.  
  
Thou foolish Beast, so rudely to withstand  
&emsp;Thy master’s will, to feel such idle fears!  
Why, Pig, there’s not a Lady in the land  
&emsp;Who has not also bor’d and ring’d her Ears.  
  
Pig! ’tis they Master’s Pleasure — then be still,  
&emsp;And hold your nose to let the Iron through —  
Dare you resist your lawful Sovereign’s will?  
&emsp;Rebellious swine! you know not what you do?  
  
To Man o’er every Beast the Power was giv’n;  
&emsp;Pig, hear the Truth, and never murmur more!

Wou’d you rebel against the Will of Heav’n?  
&emsp;Thou impious Beast, be still! and let them bore!  
  
The social Pig resigns his nat’ral rights  
&emsp;When first with Man he convenants to live;  
He barters them for safer Sty delights,  
&emsp;For Grains and Mash, which Man alone can give.  
  
Sure is Provision on the Social Plan,  
&emsp;Secure the Comforts that to each belong:—  
Oh! happy Swine! th’ impartial sway of Man  
&emsp;Alike protects, the weak Pig and the strong.  
  
And you resist! you struggle now, because  
&emsp;Your Master has thought fit to bore your nose!  
You grunt, in flat Rebellion to the Saws  
&emsp;Society finds needful to impose!  
  
Go to the Forest, Piggy, and deplore  
&emsp;The miserable lot of savage Swine!

See how the young Pigs fly from the great Boar,  
&emsp;And see how coarse and scantily they Dine.  
  
Behold their hourly Danger, when who will  
&emsp;May hunt or snare or seize them for his Food!  
Oh! happy Pig! whom none presumes to kill  
&emsp;Till your protecting Master, thinks it good!  
  
And when, at last, the closing hours of Life  
&emsp;Arrives (for Pigs must die as well as Man)  
When in your Throat you feel the long sharp knife  
&emsp;And the Blood trickles to the under Pan;  
  
And when, at last, the Death Wound yawning wide,  
&emsp;Fainter and fainter grows th’ expiring cry,  
Is there no grateful Joy, no loyal Pride,  
&emsp;To think that for your Master’s Good you die?
