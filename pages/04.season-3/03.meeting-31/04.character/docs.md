She dothe possesse of wit, soe large a Share  
With meak humility soe sweetly blente,  
That truly <span data-tippy="they" class="green">all</span> arounde her gaze, and saye  
Her soule seraphic might a kindred claime  
With some brighte Angel of Heav’n’s blest abode.  
Talke not to me of Beauty’s fading flower;  
Beauty is but an evanescent charme  
Which in youth’s sunshine blooms in vivid pride,  
But droopes unpitied in the shade of years.  
Oh! ’tis the Soule of Puritie that speakes  
When Marian glances that expressive eye,  
Mortals enchanted owne her magic power  
Which blandly leades them, admiration strucke  
To emulate the worthe they soe revere.
