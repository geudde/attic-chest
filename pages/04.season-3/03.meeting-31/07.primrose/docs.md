#### Addressed to a Friend before leaving the Country  
  
Tho’ fogs and <span data-tippy="sleeting" class="green">sleety</span> rains prevail,  
&emsp;Thou flow’r of humble form,  
Rears’t thy fair head to meet the gale,  
&emsp;Nor droop’d beneath the storm.  
  
Tho’ frosts begem the wrinkled leaf,  
&emsp;Thy amber petals bloom  
Of Garden ornaments the chief  
&emsp;Within stern winter’s gloom.  
  
I’ll shield thee Primrose when the snow  
&emsp;On breezes keen descend  
Yon osiers shall a screen bestow  
&emsp;Thy foliage to defend.  
  
To Innocence if Virtue guard  
&emsp;Shall brave misfortune’s pow’r,  
And life’s clear sky again reward,  
&emsp;The late unshelter’d flow’r.  
  
Then bloom — to cheer the dreary day  
&emsp;The sole Corolla near,  
Till Spring with warm enliv’ning ray  
&emsp;Proclaims thou’st nought to fear.  
  
Ah! then I’d seek thee in the shade,  
&emsp;They flow’ry tribes pursue  
Where I have seen the blossoms fade  
&emsp;Retrace the violet new.  
  
If forc’d this pleasing spot to leave,  
&emsp;May some kind hand be found,  
Robin! thy little cares to ease,  
&emsp;And scatter crumbs around.  
  
So when the death of winter’s past,  
&emsp;And Cowslips deck the plain;  
I’ll hope where here I fed him last  
&emsp;To meet the pet again!  
  
And mem’ry with delight shall trace  
&emsp;The many cheerful hours;  
Sport with the lovely feather’d race  
&emsp;Our shrubs and fav’rite flow’rs.  
  
While Hope the scene presents to view  
&emsp;That friendship could endear,  
May *Spring* the Happiness renew  
&emsp;That Winter promis’d *here*.
