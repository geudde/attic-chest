And he that lives may see,  
If not stark blind he be,  
Or a tort e’en hath he,  
Whether yet true it be,  
That not in a million, *three,*  
Are fit for Alchymie,  
Or, a true work e’er did see:  
So sings Dan Somebodie,  
In Rhyme right wittilie,  
For a Monk, perdie, was he,  
In the year septcent & three;  
As it recorded be,  
In a pin right merrilie  
By Squire Ashmole,  
In his Chymie Brittaniee,  
And is here re-said by me,  
Who hold Philosophie,  
And all its Vanitie,  
From Herm, to Doctor Dee,  
Just, three skips of a flea.  
&emsp;Aye, just of a flea, skips three,  
&emsp;That gay Animalcule.
