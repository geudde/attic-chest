### Answer to the Enigma published in the Morning Herald  

How sweet the Rose’s vermil hue  
&emsp;Its opening at the Zephyr’s sigh  
It shews its bosom wet with dew,  
&emsp;That gives its charms a brighter dye.  

But sweeter far the crimson *Blush*,  
&emsp;Which, rising on the virgin’s cheek  
Tho’ maiden fears her accents hush  
&emsp;Can all the heart’s emotion speak.  

When praise her honied drops distills  
&emsp;It seems to shew a meek distrust  
Yet every feeling heart it fills,  
&emsp;With surest proof the praise is just.  

When Love would all its ardour tell  
&emsp;And all its tender fears impart,  
Oh say, could language half so well  
&emsp;Reveal the feelings of the heart.  

Whate’er its source, if conscious Love  
&emsp;Or Modesty its Birth controul  
Its rising crimson, e’er must prove  
&emsp;The offspring of a feeling soul.
