### An address to Poetry by a young Gentleman who had just finished 

Hail Heav’n-descended Poetry  
&emsp;A worthy friend and true  
Who absent long has been from thee  
&emsp;Again returns to woo:  
His wand’rings past, his studies o’er  
&emsp;That kept him hence so long,  
Amid his native hills once more  
&emsp;He tunes his simple song,  
Rejoiced again to turn to Thee  
&emsp;Heav’n-descended Poetry.  

I heed not what the World may say  
&emsp;I scorn it as before  
They’ll bid me cease to tune the lay  
&emsp;And court the Muse no more,  
&emsp;Let them who fortune’s favors share  
&emsp;Who nursed by wealth and joy  
Are free from toil and free from care  
&emsp;Here idle hours employ  
In singing songs inspired by Thee  
&emsp;Heav’n-descended Poetry”  

&emsp;But as for those whom fate severe  
&emsp;Has destin’d to be poor  
Whose labor thro’ the circling year  
&emsp;Their homely food procure  
Let *them*, contented with their doom  
&emsp;Their various toils fulfill  
Nor let their rugged hands presume  
&emsp;To wield the tuneful quill;  
For what have they to do with Thee  
&emsp;Heav’n-descended Poetry”  

Or should perchance the Sisters three  
&emsp;A studious life impose  
Let them obey the stern decree  
&emsp;Content with humble prose;  
Enough for them their tastes to tend  
&emsp;Thro’ all the livelong day  
And grateful when their labors end  
&emsp;To sleep the night away;  
But what have they to do with Thee  
&emsp;Heav’n-descended Poetry.”  


Thus will the World censorious still  
&emsp;A simple Bard descry  
But let them jeer me as they will  
&emsp;I heed them not, not I;  
They poorly fed, and thinly clad  
&emsp;And doom’d to toil so hard  
As poor heav’n knows as any lad  
&emsp;That e’er was dubbed a Bard  
Still do I delight in Thee  
&emsp;Heav’n-descended Poetry  

At Leisure if I seek the grove  
&emsp;To shun the blaze of noon,  
Or if at night I chance to rove  
&emsp;To view the changing Moon,  
If o’er the hills I lonely roam  
&emsp;Or ’long the murmuring shore  
Or seated in my sheltering home  
&emsp;I hear the tempest roar  
Still do I delight in Thee  
&emsp;Heav’n-descended Poetry.  

Of if (as often ’tis my lot)  
&emsp;Thro all the tedious day,  
From vale to vale, from cot to cot  
&emsp;I tread the lonely way;  
While at high noon the summer glows  
&emsp;Or wakes the pealing storm  
Or while the wintry winds and snows  
&emsp;The dreary plains deform  
Then do I delight in Thee  
&emsp;Heav’n-descended Poetry  

When as with weary steps I tread  
&emsp;The mountains bleak, and high  
The mist thick settling on my head  
&emsp;The night obscures the sky,  
The wild blast whistles o’er the heath  
&emsp;And swiftly flies the rain  
And bursting on the rocks beneath  
&emsp;Loud roars the foaming main,  
Then do I delight in Thee  
&emsp;Heav’n-descended Poetry.  

Sweet Maid to hear thy soothing strains  
&emsp;It lulls my griefs to rest  
And gentle melancholy reigns  
&emsp;Companion of my breast,  
For many a tear that’s dew’d mine Eye  
&emsp;The Muse has wip’d away,  
And softer heaves my bosom’s sigh  
&emsp;As sweet she tunes the lay;  
Therefore I delight in Thee  
&emsp;Heav’n-descended Poetry.  

And when thou shew’st the rich and proud  
&emsp;With cankering care opprest,  
While those by sad misfortune bow’d  
&emsp;With inward peace are blest,  
O then I cease to sigh for wealth  
&emsp;And Pomp, and lordly power,  
And all I ask of Heaven, is health  
&emsp;The calm domestic hour,  
An humble competence and Thee  
&emsp;Heav’n-descended Poetry.  
 
I love thee, sweetest, gentlest Maid  
&emsp;And tho’ the world may rail  
I still shall oft invoke thine aid  
&emsp;And tune my simple tale.  
I love the sprightly song to hear  
&emsp;That makes the breast to glow  
And love the sympathetic tear  
&emsp;That oft thou hid’st to flow  
I laugh, I sigh, I weep with Thee  
&emsp;Heav’n-descended Poetry.  

As soft and sweet thou tun’st thy strain  
&emsp;The heavenly pow’rs among  
With ravished ears the silent train  
&emsp;Sit listening to the Song;  
The gentlest of the train divine  
&emsp;Are pround to call thee, friend  
And Virtue at her hallow’d shrine  
&emsp;Delights to see thee bend;  
All, e’en all are fond of thee  
&emsp;Heav’n-descended Poetry.
