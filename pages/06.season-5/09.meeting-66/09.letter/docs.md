<div class="author">Mr Elliott</div>  

The translator of the poem from Metastasio which was read in the last number begs to offer the enclosed version of the companion piece, which, while it recants all that was said in the former, stanza by stanza, so closely resembles it in sound and structure that every line in “La Palinodia” ends with the same word as the corresponding one in “La Libertà”; and the translator has endeavoured to imitate this peculiarity as far as the different genius of the two languages would admit, but as the first poem was translated before he thought of undertaking the second, he had not the advantage of making them mutually answer to each other.
