> Lines addressed by F.R. from Dawlish, Devon to Miss Porden in London on her birthday.

Tho distant the country and wide be the space,  
And weary the way which between us we trace,  
Yet mem’ry still constant will sojourn with me  
My trav’lling companion forever to be  
And your birthday dear Ellen will ne’er be forgot  
And more than it would, if I were on the spot  
To the poles if from India may waft a sad sigh[^1]  
Fain from *Devon* to *you* thy good wishes may fly  
Tho no muse would lend wing for poetical flight  
Friendship aided by truth happly ’ll guide me aright  
Were wishes so gifted that they could impart  
The blessings abundant that spring from the heart  
Oh who w’d by poor and of blessings bereft  
As long as a friend to *wish* blessings was left!  
But yet to the mind if gives pleasure untold  
To waken the sympathy words but unfold  
Then to joy giving speeches an ear while you lend  
Reject not a line from a far distant friend  
May each year more confirm the fair promise of youth  
And the praises you meet still be given with truth  
But for Ellen a blessing or good can I trace  
Which does not her parents and kindred embrace?  
No in *them* her grail’s bounded while *she* is their treasure  
And to nothing blessings valued, they still must keep measure  
Then long, very long may you live to impart  
The joy that still springs from your own guileless heart  
And may each coming birthday still find you as gay  
As I trust this will find you dear Ellen *today*.
