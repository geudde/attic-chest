<div class="author">Communicated by Miss Beslee</div>  

> From a Gentleman in a Government Office to one in Edinburgh, in Imitation of Burns

Dear C----, your letters came on time  
&emsp;(And the receipt within it)  
To draw an answer to’t in rhyme  
&emsp;Sir I’ve a leisure minute:  
I muckle am rejoiced to find  
&emsp;Ye ha’nt forgot your duty,  
But that ye stile do bear in mind  
&emsp;The charms of female beauty  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;which bless mankind.

But yet no thanks the Glasgow dames  
&emsp;Do owe your penetration;  
Edina’s lassie only claims  
&emsp;Your lavish commendation.  
I dinna ken that one alone  
&emsp;O! bonnie Scotland’s cities  
Held undisputed, beauty’s throne  
&emsp;Tho’ such it seems your fit is  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;To give’t to one.

I love the lovely blossoms a’  
&emsp;In England or in Scotland,  
An’ evil may the wretch begla’  
&emsp;I dinna care in what land,  
Who would not, wi’ his hearts best bluid,  
&emsp;Protect the pretty creatures,  
Whom heaven has made our choicest guid  
&emsp;Wh’are dearer to our natures  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Than life or food.

Sir ye have gain’d a longer leave  
&emsp;From Mister Secretary,  
Believe me I’maun muckle grieve  
&emsp;Unless your plan you vary,  
And, ’stead of resting a’ your time  
&emsp;A’n Edinburgh billie,  
Go penetrate the highland clime  
&emsp;My honest, winsome, Willie,  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Now in your prime.

Oh, were I wi’ you C---- I trove  
&emsp;We would, I tell you fairly,  
O’er lofty hill, thro valley low  
&emsp;E’en scour the country rarely;  
We’d trace the scenes where Wallace fought  
&emsp;O’ liberty the martyr,  
When he his proud invaders taught  
&emsp;How dear he held the charter  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Which freedom brought.

How say ye — does the bride bespeak  
&emsp;O’ bairns but half a dozen?  
Weel, deil may care, she’ll not be weak  
&emsp;When sic a number’s risen,  
If that her girls are good an’ fair  
&emsp;If that her boys have honor,  
Oh, how a mother’s heart must fare  
&emsp;When bliss so smiles upon her  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Soul’s dearest care!

Then choose a wife for yoursel’  
&emsp;If life’s best joys you cherish  
For joys like these (but choose her well)  
&emsp;Wi’ life alone will perish.  
Ye’ll find in E’nburgh town, I ween,  
&emsp;Some lassie sweet an’ sonsie,  
An’ fit to be your bosom’s queen,  
&emsp;Or ye are unco donsie,  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Where ye have been.

Ye talk of bacon, ham, and tongue  
&emsp;Of Scottish ale and whisky;  
Deil man, they’ll mak the old one[8] young  
&emsp;And Jem[9] and Harry[10] frisky  
But soothe we’ll play a noble part  
&emsp;In honor o’ your giftie[11],  
An’ drink to that same oprn heart  
&emsp;That scorns to be too thrifty  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I’th giving art.

Our friend, Bob Ham, is gone to tak  
&emsp;His pleasure down at Lincoln,  
And may he no enjoyment lack  
&emsp;That fancy loves to think on  
Jack Battey, I maun grieve to say  
&emsp;Wi’ sickness still is striving  
But soon I hope will come the day  
&emsp;When he’ll again be thriving  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In health’s fair way.

Now fare ye weil until once more  
&emsp;We meet in Lunna town, man  
Come not by sea, but keep on shore  
&emsp;For fear that you should drown man  
Ye’ll think perhaps I write full oft  
&emsp;But this won’t mak ye sair man  
Here’s twenty pounds from Billy Croft  
&emsp;Which sure will keep wi’ care man  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Your head aloft.
