Said Momus to Apollo — “Brother,  
How seldom now we meet each other!  
To routs and galas I repair  
But you, it seems, are never there.  
It grieves me much to haste away;  
Adieu! I’m quite engaged to-day —   
’Tis <span class="small">ELLEN</span>’s birthday — half-past-eight!  
Have you no ticket for the Fête?”

“No ticket, Momus! — how you jest!  
I rule myself her Attic Chest:  
To-night I go unmask’d — I wor  
A hundred antic coats before.  
Once with <span class="small">ANACREON</span>’s festive lyre  
I join’d our <span class="small">ELLEN</span>’s jocund choir;  
So well I tun’d its golden string,  
His darling pigeon spread her wing  
And hover’d round to hear my sing.  
I lurk’d in Laura’s spangled cloak,  
In graceful Celia’s form I spoke,  
But in so silver-sweet a tone  
All guess’d and whisper’d ’twas my own.  

“When sage <span class="small">ELECTRO-MAG-SCRIBLERUS</span>  
With schemes and epics came to jeer us,  
I gave the busy knave his cue  
Tho’ some, perhaps, believ’d ’twas you.  
I penn’d the woes of Michael Mitre,  
I toil’d as Tabby-Letter-writer;  
They call’d me, in my cap and bib,  
Dame Nettletop and Sister Squib:  
In ev’ry shape I found employ here,  
Cook, chymist, garreteer, and lawyer.  
To-night I throw my mask away  
And only go to own my sway:  
Then, <span class="small">MOMUS</span>! never now complain  
How oft you seek for me in vain;  
’Tis true, I fly from routs and balls  
But always come when <span class="small">ELLEN</span> calls;  
And on her Birthday, ev’ry Muse  
May know APOLLO’s rendez-vous!”
