<div class="author">Mr Porden</div>  

See my Flavia gay and blooming  
&emsp;Now appears that blushing rose  
Every vernal breeze perfuming  
&emsp;Zephyr o’er it gently blows  
Soon alas! this queen of flowers  
&emsp;Will be subject to decay  
Soon, too soon, will lose its powers  
&emsp;E’er we hail another day.  

So my Fair though young and charming  
&emsp;Now you trip the verdant plain  
With love’s gentle passion warming  
&emsp;Every fond admiring swain  
Time will soon destroy those graces  
&emsp;Which your form and face disclose  
Frail are e’en the fairest faces  
&emsp;Frailer than the fading rose.
