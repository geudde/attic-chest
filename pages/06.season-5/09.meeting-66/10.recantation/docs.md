##### The Recantation, a Canzonet to Nysa

> Specimen of Translation from Metastasio No. 2  

Dear Nysa, calm thy just disdain,  
And, oh, forgive a luckless swain  
&emsp;Who pity claims from thee!  
True, I did boast thy chains were broke,  
But I no more from Love’s sweet yoke  
&emsp;Will vaunt of Liberty.

’Tis true, the ardor in my breast  
I tried to hide, and scorn suppressed  
&emsp;That love might not be seen;  
But whether at thy name my face  
Changes or not, there all may trace  
&emsp;How fares my heart within.  

If thou art not in ev’ry dream,  
Waking I always with thee seem;  
&emsp;Absent thou’rt near in thought;  
’Tis thou alone, or far or near,  
By whom with pain or joy sincere  
&emsp;My soul’s to transport wrought.  

And if I talk not of thy charms  
A peevish heat my temper warms,  
&emsp;All is forgot or wrong;  
On thee I dwell, who’er draws nigh,  
E’en to my rival’s self do I  
&emsp;With joy the *theme* prolong.

A single glance of thy disdain —   
One word of grace — I guard in vain  
&emsp;’Gainst favor or ’gainst scorn:  
Thy sweet rule only I’ll obey,  
That impulse is decreed to sway  
&emsp;Which long my heart has borne.  

Not pleasing thee, nought joys me now,  
And no delight sits on my brow  
&emsp;If ’tis not giv’n by thee:  
With thee all pleases — be it grove,  
Or hill, or mead; far from thee, Love,  
&emsp;’Tis all a blank to me.  

Now I will speak my thoughts sincere —   
Not only lovely you appear,  
&emsp;And that beyond compare,  
But oft in ev’ry other face  
Unjustly I defects can trace,  
&emsp;And only beauties there.  

I could not break the rooted dart  
I thought to draw from out my heart  
&emsp;Tho’t almost kill’d to cure;  
Trying t’escape from grief and pain,  
I’m more oppress’d, but not again  
&emsp;Could I such strife endure.  

The bird that’s caught in limy snares  
Struggling for flight his plumage tears,  
&emsp;But cannot flee away —   
The more he tries to wave his wings,  
The more the viscous traitor clings  
&emsp;That doth his flight betray.

No, I not wish my former flame  
Extinct — the more I thus declaim  
&emsp;The less I wish it so.  
A nat’ral ardor lovers prove  
To talk, and while they talk of love  
&emsp;No end their love can know.  

Thus, fate adverse, the Chief forswears  
Inconstant Mars, yet still repairs  
&emsp;Where’er his banner shows;  
But custom thus the Slave again  
Tho’ freed, resumes content the chain  
&emsp;From whence his sorrows rose.  

I speak of thee, and thee alone,  
No new affection can I own,  
&emsp;Nor can I change from thee;  
I ask thy pity in each line,  
For thy decrees, and only thine,  
&emsp;Shall always govern me.  

Ah, then, a constant heart console,  
Give, to revive a culprit’s soul,  
&emsp;Thy love as once ’twas kind!  
The lovely Nysa knows, at least,  
In her repentant Lover’s breast  
&emsp;She no deceit will find.  

Oh bid my doubts and troubles cease!  
And if thou givst one pledge of peace,  
&emsp;Balm of my heart to prove,  
As much as erst, in angry strain,  
I sung of coldness and disdain,  
&emsp;I then will sing of Love.
