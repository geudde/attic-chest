Talk not of the banquet Remembrance provides  
&emsp;Till shadows with truth can be class’d:  
One hour in the presence of new-born delights  
&emsp;O’ervalues an age of the past!  
Talk not of the flight or the ravage of time —   
&emsp;We’ll chase the dull fugitive on:  
When life is a desert and friendship a dream  
&emsp;We’ll sigh for the days that are gone!

2

Can Mem’ry dissolve the chill fetters of age?  
&emsp;Will pain from her magic depart?  
Can Fancy’s pale pictures on Memory’s page  
&emsp;Restore the rich warmth of the heart?  
Of long-buried friendship, of far-fled delight  
&emsp;The spectres pass mournfully on:  
They speak — but their whispers no rapture excite  
&emsp;They speak of the days that are gone!  

3

But is there a joy which for ever departs?  
&emsp;Can friendship to earth be consign’d?  
The joy or the love that was worthy our hearts  
&emsp;Must leave a rich relic behind!  
Have traitors deceived us with thorns among flow’rs?  
&emsp;Well! let us their folly look on:  
The rosebud of Fancy awhile has been ours,  
&emsp;The thorn to *their* pillow is gone!

4

O! let us not gaze on the wreck of our joys —   
&emsp;But build the fair fabric anew!  
The day which no hope or no friendship supplies  
&emsp;Is a day without sunshine or dew!  
Believe it — the rose-tree will flourish again,  
&emsp;Tho’ the dead leaf is trampled upon;  
Our souls, like the sun, shall their lustre retain  
&emsp;Undimm’d by the days that are gone!
