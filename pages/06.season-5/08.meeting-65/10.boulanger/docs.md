Come, come my dear no nonsense  
You’ve had enough in conscience  
Now call that powder’d fellow in  
And make him bring your pelerine  
You know I gave you warning  
I can’t stay here till morning.  

&emsp;&emsp;Pray Papa, pray Papa stay a little longer  

Your partner must excuse you  
’Twon’t break his heart to lose you  
And if you look so cross to him  
I’m sure you’ll be no loss to him,  
So bid goodnight and come now  
We ought to be at home now.

&emsp;&emsp;Pray Papa &c. &c.
