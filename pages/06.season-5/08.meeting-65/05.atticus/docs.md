<span class="title">Once more, Justice!!!!</span>


Yes, Sir, once more, compelled by wrong  
I must epistolize in song;  
Once more approach, with suitor’s air  
The Attic Editorial Chair;  
Once more intreat you not to foster  
A quack, a cheat, a bold impostor.  
No sooner one device had fail’d  
My fame and fortune that assail’d  
And I, from fear of rivals free  
In fancied fond security,  
Invok’d the Muse, and ’gan to write,  
To please my friends, my foes to spite;  
When (Oh the weight of ills and care  
A poet’s doom’d by fate to bear!  
And oh the various plans to plague us!)  
Uprose the vile Electrmagus,  
Denied th’ originality  
Of genius’ flame that burns in me,  
Pretended his electric skill  
E’en dullness’ self with soul could fill,  
And his machine the genuine source  
Of sense and wit and mental force.  
But Mr Editor beware  
You fall not in this artful snare!  
This pseudo-genius-giving sage  
I much suspect in science rage  
Has formed a diabolic plan  
To decompose at once a man  
Fuse him by force Voltaic t’earth,  
Or see what metals gave him birth;  
Or else some nymph, by scribbling’s itch  
Lured to his toils, he would bewitch  
By touch electric — ’trivance dark  
To choose *him* for her fav’rite *spark*.  
Oh let not love of science press  
To ruin’s brink our gentle Editress!  
Oh save her literary friends  
From all the ill Electromage intends!  

But should you not believe the tale  
That spark material can avail  
To kindle in the world of mind  
Etherial fire of wit refin’d —   
True genius is of different mould,  
It shines but burns not, or if bold  
Aspiring bards of deathless name  
Must be conceived the sons of flame,  
’Tis like the hallow’d fire that burn’d  
The wondrous bush, when Moses turn’d  
To marvel on the mystic power  
Of flames that burn, but not devour.

Let then this fond electric elf  
Be left to operate on himself,  
And if Castalia’s fount no more  
With inspiration bubbles o’er,  
Or few like Byron’s restless lord  
To reach Parnassus can afford;  
Yet still a chosen few shall meet  
On Attica in Berners Street.  
There slyly from the crystal vase  
The bard shall sip in Ellen’s place  
Of purity’s inspiring stream  
That clears his thoughts, refines his theme;  
For manly strength he shall resort  
To sandwich, porter, gen’rous port;  
Sweetness from custard’s luscious streams;  
Smartness and point from lemon creams,  
Meet impudence from “Busbys” gain  
From “Courtship” learn a tender strain,  
And, last not least converse polite  
Shall teach him how he ought to write.  
For ’tis with minds like flint and steel,  
Collision’s sparks their powers reveal;  
And truest inspiration’s found  
Where wit, remarks and verse go round.  
’Tis thus “my friend the member” gains  
The spirit that his Muse sustains;  
And, did not honor rule my heart,  
And secrecy I could impart  
Whose hand th’ inspiring cates conveyed  
This strain vindictive to aid,  
For oft I’ve gained a mighty power  
From cate that came in happy hour,  
By secret means from Berners Street —   
Gods! how I’d eat and write, and write and eat!  

Oh! then dismiss Electromage,  
And study the instructive page  
Of cook’ry’s art from Attic pen,  
Of which I send a specimen.  
You judge so kindly and so well  
I’m sure of justice — Sir, farewell!
