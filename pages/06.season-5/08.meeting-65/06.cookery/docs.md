Opening of the Poem — Book 1st

The joy-bestowing Art that decks the board  
With dainties cull’d from every soil and clime;  
Which ransacks Earth and Air, and Seas and Streams,  
For palate-tickling, eye-delighting cates,  
And on the genial Board of Hospitality  
Well-drest doth dish them off — Sing Heavenly Muse!  
Guide me delighted thro’ the mingling maze  
Of Fish, Flesh, Fowl, Game, Ven’son, Tarts and Tartlets;  
O! fill my soul with culinary lore,  
With all that Farley, Glasse, or Raffald knew;  
Teach my mind’s eye enraptured to survey  
The pomp of Dinners, Galas, Lord May’r’s Feasts,  
Collations, Dejeûners, Petit Soupers!  
And e’en when Hunger (pain well know to bards)  
Give direful note that the good things I sing  
By me are rarely touched and little known  
Save on some feast, to me Alas! infrequent  
Or in some page replete with cook’ry lore;  
Teach me to rise above the knawing sense  
Of cupboard-crying stomach, and to sing  
Sweetly as if sustained by Soup of Turtle  
Or with champagne and claret-song inspired!

Mr Scriblerus fears that a longer communication at present would tire the Society, but if this should meet with approbation and the plan of his work be found likely to procure him subscriber, he may be induced to send specimens of the execution of other parts of it.
