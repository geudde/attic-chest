<span class="title">Liberty, a Canzonet to Nysa</span>

> Specimen of translation from Metastasio 

Thanks to thy pow’r of giving pain,  
Nysa, at length I breathe again;  
&emsp;At length Heav’n pities me,  
For now I feel thy snares are brok,  
My soul shakes off the lover’s yoke  
&emsp;Nor *dreams* of Liberty.  

No ardor now — calm is my breast,  
So calm that nought of love suppressed  
&emsp;’Neath anger’s mask is seen.  
No more my changing color tells  
I hear thy name, no longer swells  
&emsp;My heart to meet its queen.  

I sleep, thou’rt not in ev’ry dream —   
I wake, but thou art not the theme  
&emsp;That fills my earliest thought.  
I wander far, nor wish thee near;  
And by thy presence, once so dear,  
&emsp;Nor pain nor pleasure’s brought.  

Unmov’d I dwell upon thy charms;  
No self-reproach my heart alarms  
&emsp;To think I did thee wrong;  
Confus’d no more when thou draw’st nigh,  
E’en to my rival’s self can I  
&emsp;Of thee the tale prolong.  

Glance upon me thy looks disdain,  
Or kindly speakst thou, all is vain,  
&emsp;Thy favor or thy scorn;  
No more those lips shall I obey,  
No more those eyes shall know the way  
&emsp;They to my heart had torn.  

Whate’er shall joy or pain me now,  
Be smiles or gloom upon my brow,  
&emsp;’Tis nor thy gift nor fault:  
Without thee pleases now the grove,  
The hill, the mead, with thee I move  
&emsp;Tired, where no joys exalt.

I own my shame — to break the dart  
Thou there had fix’d, it rent my heart —   
&emsp;It almost kill’d to cure:  
But, from oppression, grief and pain  
T’escape, and all himself regain,  
&emsp;What cannot Man endure?  

The bird that’s caught in limy snares  
Struggling for flight his plumage tears  
&emsp;But freely darts away;  
His feathers lost restor’d by time,  
He cautious grows, lest treach’rous lime  
&emsp;Again his flight betray.  

I know thy think’st my former flame  
Still burns — that lovers thus declaim —   
&emsp;That cure would end my song:  
No — ’tis the nat’ral wish to tell  
Of risks and scapes that erst befell  
&emsp;Makes me the verse prolong. 

I now relate, the trial o’er,  
My suff’rings — thus of wounds he bore  
&emsp;The scars the warrior shows:  
Thus blithe the slave set free displays  
The cruel chain that many days  
&emsp;He dragged mid scorn and woes.

I speak, content with that alone,  
Nor care, so easy am I grown,  
&emsp;If I’m believ’d by thee;  
Nor ask, if thou approv’st the line,  
Nor if tranquility is thine  
&emsp;Whene’er thou talk’st of me.  

You lose a heart sincere — I go  
Far from a faithless girl, nor know  
&emsp;Who first need comfort ask:  
No more you’ll meet a love so true —   
To find a nymph as false as you  
&emsp;Will be an easy task.
