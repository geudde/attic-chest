I do not propose here to trace  
Whence came the Garter’s ancient race,  
But if tradition we may trust,  
The *stocking* was invented first;  
In our third Edward’s glorious time  
Begins the subject of my rhyme,  
When chivalry, with gentle grace  
Had smoothed of war the iron face,  
And round the hero’s temples ’twined  
The myrtle with the laurel joined.

Now many a noble conquest own  
In glory’s zenith Edward shone,  
But tired at length of war’s alarms  
He bowed to beauty’s stronger charms,  
And now ’twas giv’n to Sarum’s fair  
The royal lover to ensnare.  
Large was the hall, the assembly gay,  
The torches shed a mimic day;  
The enlivening glass to all had lent  
Or heightened native merriment,  
The minstrels now to please the king,  
To sprightly measures touched the string  
And those brave knights who late in France  
Had dyed in gore the deathful lance,  
Now joined with glee the sprightly dance.  
And never was a brighter throng  
The theme of fabling poet’s song  
For Europe’s bravest sons were there  
And Albion’s fairest of the fair.  

On beauty’s breast, Love’s sweetest throne,  
Or floating locks, or sparkling zone,  
The diamonds caught the torches rays,  
And flash’d a momentary blaze.  
Her tresses floating on the gale  
Arabia’s choicest sweets exhale,  
More graceful than the swans that glide  
On winding Avon’s classic tide —  
Or swallows that in rapid flight,  
Seem lost in Heaven’s cerulean light,  
Swift thro’ the mazy dance she floats,  
Responsive to the minstrel’s notes  
Who now a louder measure ring  
And swifter strike the trembling string,  
And while her cheek alternate shows  
The lily pale, the blushing rose,  
Oft in a low and hurried tone  
Distinguished by her ear alone,  
Will Love his secret birth make known.  

The monarch now, his age forgot,  
His dignity, his corns, what not,  
Seized the fair Countess’ snowy hand  
And led to join the sprightly band.  
All to the radiant pair gave way,  
And on they tripped alert and gay.  
But here my blushing Muse would fain  
Conceal the truth, or drop the strain,  
For now as ancient legends tell  
The Countess’ azure garter fell!  
The monarch seized the envied prize  
With glowing cheek and sparkling eyes  
And twined with much of festive glee,  
The ribband round his royal knee,  
As gaily rising from the ground  
He saw each fair one standing round  
Her fan of various plumage made  
Held up, the smile, or blush, to shade.  
Then, “Honi soit qui mal y pense”  
He cried, and join’d again the dance.

Henceforth as valour’s best reward  
The badge of blue the monarch gave,  
This envied mark, which all regard  
The guerdon of the great and brave.  

Ye fair from you the order rose  
Hence modern beaux may learn of old  
What honors to the sex was paid,  
May hear, and blush, as they are told.

And now I leave the lighted hall  
The minstrel’s harp, the sprightly ball,  
To sylvan themes my lyre I string  
Your aid ye sylvan Muses bring.  

Tis May — all Nature smiles around,  
And flowers adorn the enamelled ground,  
In fragrant robe the thorn is dressed,  
Or glows with roseate hue,  
The poppy boasts its crimson vest  
The harebell hangs its head of blue.  
And see in yonder verdant glade  
A gay and festive scene displayed,  
Where clad in robes of cheerful green  
Yon stately elms extend their screen,  
See all the rural world repair,  
To taste the pleasures of the fair.  
In plain and modest garb attired,  
There rustic beauty shines admired.  
The swains in many a sylvan sport  
Contend to win some envied prize  
Ambition thus, in field or court  
Impels the simple, or the wise.  
&emsp;Round the tall pole in frolic ring,  
With artless grace they gaily spring,  
Or celebrate in pastoral lay  
The beauties of the youthful May.  
On every face, in every eye,  
Is seen the smile, the glance of joy.  
&emsp;But mark yon youth, his steady pace,  
His neat attire, and artless grace,  
Health on his rosy cheek is seen  
And joy shine thro’ his modest mien,  
While his dark eyes reveal a mind  
Tho’ steady cheerful, frank, and kind.  
In vain the rustic maidens try  
To draw the youthful Colin’s eye,  
For him in vain the flowery crown  
Amid their clustering ringlets shone,  
Or conscious of her form, the fair  
Adjusts her robe with nicer care.  
While rivals cast a jealous eye  
Unnoticed — Colin passed them by   
For Adelina favoured maid  
To whom his vows of love were paid,  
Whose charms inspired his artless song,  
Was not amid the festal throng.  
&emsp;Now where a pedlar held to view  
His stores of various kind and hue  
He came — knives, scissors, there displayed  
Needles and pins in order laid  
Laces, and songs, and ribbands gay  
Invite the passing youth to stay.  
The store he viewed nor pondered long,  
But chose the subject of my song  
Twin garters snowy white of hue  
Save where he read, in lines of blue  
“If you love me, as I love you,  
No power on earth, shall part us two.”  
His purchase made, with eager haste  
Along a sheltered lane he passed,  
And soon he reached the lovely spot,  
Where stood his Adelina’s cot;  
The garden small but neat, was planned  
And cultured by her gentle hand;  
There wallflowers shone, and tulips gay,  
In all the flowery pride of May,  
The lilac shed its rich perfume,  
Woodbines just bursting into bloom  
To the supporting trellis clung,  
And o’er the door their branches flung,  
Above, the timid vine, was seen,  
Scarce yet uncurled, her tendrils green.  
The birds, for whom around the door  
Her hand in winter, spread the store,  
Now warbled from a neighbouring grove  
Their varied notes, of joy, and love.  
He entered where the duteous maid  
Beside her mother’s couch had stayed  
Nor murmured that her parent’s pain  
Withheld her from the festal train.  
(For sickness, wont to take its wing  
At the mild influence of the spring  
Had unsubdued still lingered here  
Regardless of the advancing year,)  
Yet oft she cast toward the fair  
A wondering glance, “Is Colin there?”  
He came, her glowing cheeks revealed  
The joy her bashful lips concealed;  
As o’er her mother’s couch he bent  
With question kind, and looks intent  
Expression to his youthful face,  
And speaking eye, lent livelier grace,  
In secret, while the maiden stole  
A glance that showed her inmost soul.  
&emsp;Now Colin turning to the maid  
With hurried hand his gift displayed,  
“Now small” he cried, its worth must prove  
Weighed with her merit or his love,  
Yet trusted she would kindly take  
The humble gift, for Colin’s sake  
And hoped that it might first be worn  
On Adelina’s nuptial morn. 

With something ’twixt a smile and tear  
The maid received the gift of love  
The mother smiled upon the pair  
And joy the rapid moments drove.  

Now soon with health restored again  
The dame could join the festive train,  
When Colin to the altar led  
With bashful joy, the blushing maid,  
Hymen propitious, blest the hour  
And Heaven its blessings deigned to shower  
On his, and Adelina’s bower
