##### Epistle the 1st  

> To Celia in the Country  

Oh Celia! why delay so long?  
Hast thou forgot thy skill in song,  
Or does Albertus claim the part  
I once possessed in Celia’s heart.  
And is thy stock of love so small,  
That thou must give Albertus all!  
I thought when Love the bosom gain’d  
That Friendship still her hold retained,  
He did not make that bosom poor  
But rather added to its store  
Gave brighter smiles to Friendship’s face  
Affection decked with sweeter grace  
And bade us still more keenly feel  
Another’s woe, another’s weal;  
But yet, tho’ this and more, he gave  
Would still his due attention have.  

But if alas, as oft I’ve feared  
And Celia’s silence has declared  
Love is a selfish niggard feeling  
Like poison o’er the senses stealing  
Each purer passion to remove  
Why then, I vow, I’ll never love!  
With Reason’s Ægis armed, my heart  
Shall still unconquered brave his dart  
I’ll foil his arts, I’ll shun his snares  
Nor shall he catch me unawares.  

Nay smile not, with that roguish eye  
Nor deem, while Love I thus decry  
I think of Corydon and sigh,  
Nor while I thus with warmth accuse  
The lengthen’d silence of your Muse.  
With equal rage and indignation  
On me *retort* the accusation.  

Yon happy Maid can lingering rove  
At leisure thro’ the shady grove,  
Or by some winding river laid  
Whose banks the verdant alders shade,  
Or in some sparry grot recline,  
And there invoke the friendly Nine  
While all the Naiads of the flood,  
And all the Dryads of the wood,  
And all the gentle Gnomes that dwell  
The tenants of the crystal cell,  
And all the Fauns and Satyrs round  
Drawn by the sweet attractive sound,  
Shall to the Grotto’s gate repair,  
And feed entranced the ravished ear.  
Nay Artemis if near she strays  
Shall for awhile forget the chase,  
And circled by her virgin band  
There lost in admiration stand.  
Or if thou wakest the lyre at night  
Will check her coursers rapid flight,  
To hang delighted o’er the spot,  
And brighten with her smile the grot.  

But whither does my fancy stray,  
I only meant dear Maid to say  
What you at pleasure wake the lay,  
While I am still unhappy bound  
To flutter on in Fashion’s round.  

Forbade to seek poetic shades  
Or court the fair Aonian Maids  
And if perchance I tune the string  
What has my modish Muse to sing?  
Nothing but Concert, Play, or Ball,  
But if you wish, I’ll sing them all.  

When titled Fashion sits “at home”  
What numbers throng her glitt’ring dome,  
What Beauty reigns the favored Belle,  
What rival Maids with envy swell,  
What Lovers sigh, and what their fate,  
And what the Senate now debate,  
What *charitable* Damsels hie  
To see Lothario fall, and spy  
His diamonds with a longing eye  
In short, how all, by various ways  
Court Notoriety, or Praise  
While you in rural strains declare  
The pleasures of the Wake or Fair.
