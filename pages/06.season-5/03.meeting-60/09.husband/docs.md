1

They say this Alpine cot is drear,  
These mountain-rocks are rude and bare;  
And when the clouds of midnight scowl,  
’Tis sad to hear the torrent howl:  
Yet still I love this rocky pile  
For here I met thy fondest smile;  
’Twas sweet along the torrents side  
To watch thy coming shadow glide:  
And when yon clouded moon I see,  
I know my Henry thinks on me!

2

When in this lonely bow’r I rest  
And gaze upon the fading west,  
’Tis not because in fancy’s eyes  
My father’s castle-turrets rise;  
It is because the wild weeds wave  
Unheeded round my mother’s grave;  
Because no daughter’s duteous tear  
Drops balmy on her distant bier —   
Ah! who can tell but mine may be  
Forgotten by my babe and thee!  

3

When round my neck a sister prest  
And hid her wan cheek in my breast,  
Would Henry know why mute and weak,  
I look’d the grief I could not speak?  
Not for my native home I sigh’d,  
My father’s wealth, my kindred’s pride;  
It griev’d my conscious breast to own  
A softness to thy soul unknown;  
I griev’d that other eyes should see  
A tear in mine unfelt by thee!

4

When faithful Agnes bade me trust  
To friendship ever fond and just,  
While oft and long she linger’d near  
And watch’d my half-forbidden tear,  
I wept not that on Albion’s shore  
Our kindred hearts should meet no more —   
O no! I only fear’d to prove  
That friendship had less pangs than love:  
I would not live to feel that she  
Was truer to my trust than thee!

5

But when, a fonder kiss to claim,  
My infant lisps a father’s name,  
Or trills these echoing rocks among  
Thy Dora’s oft-remember’d songs,  
I will not, cannot fear to find  
Thy heart ungentle or unkind;  
For well I know thou could’st not press  
His cherub lips and love me less;  
Thou could’st not hear his voice and be  
A truant from thy home and me!  

6

Come, Henry, come! — our cot is warm,  
Safe shelter’d from the mountain-storm!  
Content and social Peace are here,  
They cannot fly while thou art near;  
Tho’ Beauty, Youth and Wealth depart  
My love shall find them in thy heart —   
Beneath these hills’ eternal snow  
The purest fires of nature glow:  
No winter in the clime can be  
Where Henry lives — and lives for me!
