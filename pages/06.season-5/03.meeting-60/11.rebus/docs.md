<div class="author">Communicated by Miss Flaxman</div>

The noblest object in the works of Art,  
The brightest scene that Nature can impart,  
The well-known signal in the time of peace  
The point essential in the tenant’s lease,  
The Farmer’s comfort when he holds the plough  
The Soldier’s duty, and the Lover’s vow,  
The Planet seen between the Earth and Sun,  
The prize which Merit yet has never won,  
The Miser’s idol, and the badge of Jews  
The Wife’s ambition and the Parson’s dues.  
Now if your noble Nature can divine  
A correspondent word for every line  
By the first letter will be clearly shown  
And antient city of no small renown.
