> Enter Groanilda and Melissa

Melissa:&ensp;The evening star now trembles in the sky  
&emsp;&emsp;As loth to take his ling’ring, last farewell —   
&emsp;&emsp;Sweet friend, the shop is closed — we’ll wander here  
&emsp;&emsp;While the soft blackbird chants its hymn to May —   
&emsp;&emsp;Mother of cheerfulness, whose cradle rocks  
&emsp;&emsp;The youthful poet in his dreams of love!

Groanilda:&ensp;Alas! no blackbird chants — no cradle rocks  
&emsp;&emsp;To soothe the anguish of a widow’d bride!  
&emsp;&emsp;These plumbs are all the solace, all the wealth  
&emsp;&emsp;My Tancred left me!

Melissa:&ensp;Gods! no settlement?

Groanilda:&ensp;Dire deeds find wondrous tongues — attend, Melissa!  
&emsp;&emsp;Late at the hour of twilight as I watch’d  
&emsp;&emsp;The candles clustered round my Tancred’s door,  
&emsp;&emsp;Methought his dark and silent desk unclos’d  
&emsp;&emsp;And his blest spirit stood in earthly shape  
&emsp;&emsp;Strip’d cotton vest and hose of speckled blue!  
&emsp;&emsp;He smil’d — a husband’s smile! then sad and stern  
&emsp;&emsp;His eyes roll’d on me, and his golden hair  
&emsp;&emsp;Hung loose and stain’d with blood!

Melissa:&ensp;Mysterious tale!

Groanilda:&ensp;The glimm’ring tapers sunk; a shadowy hand  
&emsp;&emsp;Unveil’d his awful forehead and disclos’d  
&emsp;&emsp;Beneath the velvet circle of his cap  
&emsp;&emsp;A wide and ghastly wound!

Melissa:&ensp;’Tis strange! Go on!

Groanilda:&ensp;Deep thunder shook the shelves — the spectre cried  
&emsp;&emsp;“Remember me! remember!” when I knelt  
&emsp;&emsp;And crav’d its will, it vanish’d with a howl —   
&emsp;&emsp;O seek to know no more!

> Enter Teapottus and Bertram

&emsp;&emsp;What, moping still?  
&emsp;&emsp;Evermore show’ring for a lover’s death?  
&emsp;&emsp;Tancred is food for worms — but here is Bertram  
&emsp;&emsp;Bertram, the sage, the valiant, the renown’d!  
&emsp;&emsp;Heir of my wealth and foreman of my shop!  
&emsp;&emsp;Why scorn the living to adore the dead?  
&emsp;&emsp;The widow’s soul to witless grief resign’d  
&emsp;&emsp;Wastes like the tapers doom’d to burn in tombs,  
&emsp;&emsp;Or like the tea-dust held in infant hands,  
&emsp;&emsp;Unseen and unenjoy’d!

Groanilda:&ensp;’Tis true, my father!  
&emsp;&emsp;But let me nurse the glorious grief I love;  
&emsp;&emsp;Grief is my wealth, my company, my pride!  
&emsp;&emsp;And it is sweet to sit behind this board  
&emsp;&emsp;Counting the papers twirl’d by Tancred’s hand  
&emsp;&emsp;Or the white glossy leaves he lov’d to clip,  
&emsp;&emsp;Till my soul sinks in that delicious trance  
&emsp;&emsp;Which never had a name!

Bertram:&ensp;Such trance is mine  
&emsp;&emsp;When on thy downcast eyes I sit and gaze  
&emsp;&emsp;While from their gold-fring’d lids a tear descends  
&emsp;&emsp;On the faint roses of thy faded cheek.  
&emsp;&emsp;O! as that tear-drop represents a pearl  
&emsp;&emsp;Tho’ but a wat’ry image, cold and weak,  
&emsp;&emsp;So let thy pity now resemble love  
&emsp;&emsp;And I will bless the gracious counterfeit,  
&emsp;&emsp;Though the true gem lies buried with my Brother!  

Teapottus:&ensp;Yes, wed him, Daughter! — think how oft and long  
&emsp;&emsp;His hose have slept undarn’d, his frill unsmooth’d,  
&emsp;&emsp;While his fond heart drank poison from thine eye.  
&emsp;&emsp;Think too what gorgeous bales of new-spun silk,  
&emsp;&emsp;What precious rings and watches unredeem’d  
&emsp;&emsp;From Dobree’s sale he brought home yesterday:—   
&emsp;&emsp;All these are pack’d for thee!

Groanilda:&ensp;You urge me sorely;  
&emsp;&emsp;But if this frozen heart can yield a spark  
&emsp;&emsp;Of Love’s electric fire, he may expect it —   
&emsp;&emsp;And take the tissue to my milliner’s!  

Teapottus:&ensp;Why, this is wisely said — come, fill the bowl  
&emsp;&emsp;With spicy arrack and the lemon’s juice:  
&emsp;&emsp;We will be glad — then bring the caitiff-minstrel  
&emsp;&emsp;Who with grim face and engine of strange sound  
&emsp;&emsp;Chants forth “Galanty Show!” — haste, call him hither.

> Enter Showman

&emsp;&emsp;My eldest hope, my brave, my buried Tancred  
&emsp;&emsp;Lov’d music when a boy — before the frock  
&emsp;&emsp;Of childhood was cut short, and wond’rous oft  
&emsp;&emsp;With plumbs purloin’d or new-coin’d halfpenny  
&emsp;&emsp;We found him greeting the brown ballad-nymphs:  
&emsp;&emsp;My long-lost Tancred! (weeps and sobs)

Showman:&ensp;If it pleases you  
&emsp;&emsp;To see the long-lost dead reviv’d again  
&emsp;&emsp;In shape corporeal and in known attire,  
&emsp;&emsp;My lanthorn and old clothes-bag will supply  
&emsp;&emsp;Both vest and visage.

Groanilda:&ensp;Has thine art such pow’r?  
&emsp;&emsp;Then it would cheer my widow’d soul to see  
&emsp;&emsp;My Tancred, my betroth’d, my soul’d espous’d,  
&emsp;&emsp;E’en as he look’d, in apron of pure white,  
&emsp;&emsp;Fill’d with the tears he carried when he fell  
&emsp;&emsp;Alas! to rise no more!  

Showman:&ensp;Let all be silent  
&emsp;&emsp;While from its mansion in the sev’n-fold spheres  
&emsp;&emsp;I call his wand’ring shadow — Soul of Tancred!  
&emsp;&emsp;Come from the crystalline and convex orb  
&emsp;&emsp;Bright with ethereal gas-light, where thou sittest  
&emsp;&emsp;Drinking the fragrant and nectareous tea  
&emsp;&emsp;Assign’d to those who weigh it well below!  
&emsp;&emsp;If midst the interminable flood of sound  
&emsp;&emsp;Too fine for ears to hear or tongue to name,  
&emsp;&emsp;Thou heedest ought on earth, descend and answer!  
&emsp;&emsp;Come in thy mortal robes of Tyrian blue  
&emsp;&emsp;Spun from Merino’s fleece and sold in Holborn —   
&emsp;&emsp;Then with thy fleshless arms and shadowy thumbs  
&emsp;&emsp;Show us the ghastly, deep and yawning wound  
&emsp;&emsp;From whence thy pure innocuous life escap’d  
&emsp;&emsp;Like a white pigeon thro’ a crimson net!  

> An invisible chorus of groans —   
> Displays his magic lantern

Bertram:&ensp;A wound! what wound! — he died of bruises dire —   
&emsp;&emsp;His coat was without stain — I have it here —   
&emsp;&emsp;Here in the garret-chest!  

Groanilda:&ensp;Behold and see!  
&emsp;&emsp;It is, it is my Tancred! ’tis his vest —   
&emsp;&emsp;I bought it second-hand — lo! there the patch  
&emsp;&emsp;I put upon his sleeve!

Bertram:&ensp;The caitiff mocks us —   
&emsp;&emsp;My Brother sleeps in peace — his spirit rests —   
&emsp;&emsp;If it could visit us, it would return  
&emsp;&emsp;As the fond dove returns to bless its mate,  
&emsp;&emsp;A messenger of peace and joy and love!  

Showman:&ensp;Perhaps thou seest him now! perhaps he looks  
&emsp;&emsp;E’en *thus*, on *thee*, his murd’rer!

> Drops his mask. A very loud scream heard. Teapottus leaps upon the counter. Bertram creeps under it and enter — 

Bow Street Officers:&ensp;Seize th’ impostor!  
&emsp;&emsp;His robe is borrow’d and this vehicle  
&emsp;&emsp;Of painted witchcraft and prismatic light  
&emsp;&emsp;He filch’d from Sidney’s Alley.  

Showman:&ensp;Sirs, I bought it  
&emsp;&emsp;Of Benjamin the Jew.

Bertram:&ensp;Believe him not!  
&emsp;&emsp;He is a crafty vagrant, and he came  
&emsp;&emsp;To pour his tales of fortune in the ear  
&emsp;&emsp;Of this fair dame whose conscious blushes vie  
&emsp;&emsp;With the soft folding of the damask rose.  

Bow St. Off.:&ensp;Sir Bertram fairly met! — within that draw’r  
&emsp;&emsp;Lie stores of newspun silk and pearls and toys  
&emsp;&emsp;Won by your wily hand from Dobree’s shop.  
&emsp;&emsp;Justice has pois’d her scales — her red right arm  
&emsp;&emsp;Is stretch’d to crush ye all — prepare and tremble!  

Teapottus:&ensp;What, both my sons! — both felons and both captives!  
&emsp;&emsp;Have these few hairs been blanch’d by threescore years  
&emsp;&emsp;Without a stain, and must I rend them now  
&emsp;&emsp;In ruin and despair? — The King of light  
&emsp;&emsp;Ne’er stopp’d his blazing chariot wheels to view  
&emsp;&emsp;A Grocer’s shop more honest!  

Bow St. Off.:&ensp;Rev’rend sage,  
&emsp;&emsp;A father’s tears look beauteous on thy cheek  
&emsp;&emsp;Like balmy incense on a silver shrine.  
&emsp;&emsp;We know the sun of wisdom gilds the age  
&emsp;&emsp;And wealth improves its brightness — follow *us* —   
&emsp;&emsp;The Judge will take thy bail.  

Groanilda:&ensp;My Sire and Husband!  
&emsp;&emsp;Alas! — ***I’m very sorry!!!***
