Ladies

Permit an old Limb of the Law to offer his services to conduct the legal part of your affairs which I trust are such as to require my assistance. Should my presumptuous rival enter the lists with me as to this appointment I shall be ready to fight him with his own weapons. The place of Treasurer would if also bestowed upon me save your fund, as I would fill that office without any *fixed* salary, merely reimbursing myself for expenses out of pocket.  

I remain with profound respect  
Ladies  
Your obsequious devoted servant  
Gallus
