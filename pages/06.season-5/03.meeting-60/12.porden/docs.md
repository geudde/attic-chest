Those whom the Muses still invite  
Imagine it no task to write  
Their sprightly Fancies can resist  
Sol’s scorching Ray — November’s mist  
Alike in country, or in town  
Alike if fortune smile or frown  
While such as only can aspire  
By casual starts to touch the lyre  
Oft slight the boon when it is lent  
And soon diverted from their bent  
Find in each change, impediment.

To Eleanor all seasons smile  
Winter’s harsh hours she can beguile  
Can, in the nerve relaxing heat  
With various lay, flowing and sweet  
The Ear enchant, inspire the feet  
And place the languid frame and soul  
Under Terpsichore’s control  
To her the sound of London’s cries  
From “Sweet Briar” to “Hot Meat Pies”  
For Pastorals can give a hint  
As steel can strike our fire from flint  
While her conservatory’s flowers  
Shall sketch out fair Arcadian Bowers  
But no such inspiration shines  
O’er her when Friendship pens these lines  
Partly to show she has the will,  
Could she but animate her quill,  
Partly to shield her taste from blame,  
And as a member hold her claim;  
Praying that should she be away  
On Hermes’ next propitious day  
Ellen would smile on this Essay.
