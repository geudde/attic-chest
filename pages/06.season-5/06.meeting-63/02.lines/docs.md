I hope this little plant beneath your care  
And kindly-culturing hand will stronger grow  
Let it sometimes adorn your bosom fair  
Nor all its sweet perfumes in vain bestow.  

I wish when peaceful resting near your heart  
Its branch could *know* what *virtues* it concealed,  
A fairer dye would all its leaves impart,  
And to oblige me, kinder odours yield.  

What tho’ ’tis not in flowery tints arrayed  
Nor ever boasts a bloom of color bright,  
What tho’ unmasked it lifts its humble head  
Nor feels ambition to attract the sight;

Yet still its virtues unimpeached remain  
Its sweeter scent not lilies can excel  
E’en years its balmy fragrance it retains  
Theirs oft is withered by each ruder gale.

Veritas
