> An Antient Fragment Found in the Skeleton Case of the County Hospital at York 

Behold this ruin! — ’twas a skull  
Once of ethereal spirit full!  
This narrow cell was life’s retreat,  
This space was Thought’s mysterious seat:  
What beauteous pictures fill’d this spot!  
What dreams of pleasure long forgot!  
Nor Love, nor Joy, nor Hope, nor Fear  
Has left one feeble record here!  

Beneath this mould’ring canopy  
Once shone the bright and busy eye!  
But start not at the gloomy void!  
If Social Love that eye employ’d,  
If with no lawless fire it gleam’d,  
But thro’ the dew of kindness beam’d,  
That eye shall be for ever bright  
When stars and sun have lost their light!  

Here, in this silent cavern hung  
The ready, swift, and tuneful tongue!  
If Falsehood’s honey it disdain’d  
And when it could not praise, was chain’d;  
If bold in Virtue’s cause it spoke,  
Yet peaceful Concord never broke  
That tuneful tongue shall plead for thee  
When Death unveils Eternity!

Perhaps these fingers, shrunk and bare,  
Might once adorn the diamond’s glare;  
To delve the more or wear the gem  
Can nothing now avail to them:  
But if the prose of peace they sought  
And comfort to the mourner brought  
These hands a richer meed shall claim  
Than all that waits on Wealth or Fame!  

Avails it whether bare or shod  
These feet the path of duty trod?  
If from the bow’rs of Vice they fled  
To seek the poor man’s friendless bed,  
If Grandeur’s guilty bribe they spurn’d  
And home to Virtue’s lap return’d  
Those feet with angel-wings shall vie  
And tread the Palace of the Sky!

Perhaps the enclosed may deserve a place among the sprightlier Jeu d’esprits in the Attic Chest.
