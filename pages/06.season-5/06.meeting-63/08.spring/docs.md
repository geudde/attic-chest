##### A Canzonet

1

Youth of the rising year, sweet spring,  
Parent of new-born loves and flow’rs  
That joy and fragrance lavish fling,  
Now blithe returns, but not to bring  
Aught that can soothe my lonely hours,  
For Isabel, thou’rt false to me,  
And all I’ve lost, in losing thee.

2

Yes, spring returns, in beauty bright  
But sheds on me no beam of joy,  
For nought it brings my mental sight  
But memory of last delight!  
That doth each present good destroy  
Now Isabel thou’rt false to me,  
I’ve lost my all in losing thee.

3

The vernal glories of the year  
Now rise the same as erst they rose  
But I the same no more appear;  
To Isabel no longer dear,  
I wail in broken strains my woes  
My Isabel is false to me!  
I’ve lost my all in losing thee!

4

Oh what a blissful state were love  
If the enchanting dream could last!  
Or when its joys no more we prove  
Then mem’ry too would far remove  
Nor turn to pain the raptures past!  
Ah Isabel, thou’rt false to me!  
I’ve lost my all in losing thee!
