##### To a Friend

It starts, it falls — a trembling tear  
&emsp;Down thy lov’d cheek, Maria, steals,  
A second follows — ah I fear  
&emsp;Some pain thy gentle bosom feels:  

It does, and I full well can know  
&emsp;The secret spring which gave them birth,  
And while like lucid pearls they glow  
&emsp;Account them more than millions worth.

For know, the heart that prompts the eye,  
&emsp;At tales of woe with tears to shine  
Possesses Sensibility  
&emsp;That makes its owner half divine.  

But let me wipe those tears away  
&emsp;Thy rose-resembling cheeks that stain;  
And Oh, believe me when I say,  
&emsp;I never more will give thee pain.
