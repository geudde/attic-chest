Yes! while Youth and Health are mine  
&emsp;I will shun the shaft of sorrow,  
Bend today at pleasure’s shrine,  
&emsp;None are certain of tomorrow.  

Youth, tho’ like the rainbow bright,  
&emsp;Like the rainbow melts away:  
Yet I’ll catch the glorious sight  
&emsp;Ere its brilliant tints decay.  

At the withering hand of time  
&emsp;Soon the rose of health may pine,  
But while blooming in its prime  
&emsp;Be its treasured perfume mine.  

Mirth their reign shall long extend  
&emsp;And a brighter charm shall give,  
The warmth that bids the rose expand,  
&emsp;The sun that bids the rainbow live.

Some in youth are never young —   
&emsp;Some in age are ever gay,  
Time unheeded flies along,  
&emsp;Ev’ry month to them is May.  

Then while Youth and Health are mine  
&emsp;I will shun the shaft of sorrow —   
Bend today at pleasure’s shrine  
&emsp;None are certain of tomorrow.  

If tomorrow grief should bring  
&emsp;I can greet her with a smile,  
Soften down her keenest sting,  
&emsp;Half her bitterness beguile.  

Expectation cools our joys,  
&emsp;But to grief imparts new pain;  
Fear’s dark cloud our bliss destroys  
&emsp;When delight alone should reign.  

Then I will not think how soon  
&emsp;Joy’s ambrosial cup may sour,  
Nor amid the blaze of noon  
&emsp;Shrink from midnight’s frigid hour.

Still while Youth and Health are mine  
&emsp;I will shun the shaft of sorrow;   
Bend today at pleasure’s shrine  
&emsp;Nor fear the care that comes tomorrow.
