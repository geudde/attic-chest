> A Letter to - - - - Esq.

1

Where love is the day-star that guides the fond youth,  
He ne’er long with incertitude roves;  
To his Ellen he flies, at the altar of truth  
In the grot in the midst of the groves.

There pledging his vows — crowns with blossoms his bride  
An emblem celestial, which proves,  
That constancy, peace, and content will abide  
In the grot in the midst of the groves.
