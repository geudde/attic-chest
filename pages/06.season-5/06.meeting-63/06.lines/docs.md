<span class="title">Lines addressed to a young friend on her birthday</span>

What it is to your friends, may this day be to you  
And each year in revolving the pleasure renew!  
May no cloud cast its shade, and no cold chilling blight  
Destroy youth’s fair promise of opening delight  
But may heaven watch o’er you with fostering care  
And blessings unfading disperse to your share.  
Or if sorrow’s dark hour one day must be yours  
Whose winter of pain ev’ry mortal endures,  
May heaven but frown as a parent dear child  
And its chastening hand still be lenient and mild,  
Then like the fair lily that bends in the rain  
You will shake off the drops and rise fresher again  
But long may the season of gaiety last  
Which smiles on the present, the future, and past  
May pleasure long tune your soft voice’s clear sound  
And lend wings to your feet in the dance’s light round  
Long may you the winning playfulness happily blend  
With sense that endears the companion and friend  
Nor e’er affectation with sick’ning grimace  
The intelligence banish which beams in your face  
Nor e’er may the flatt’ry you one day will hear  
Be thought of but just as it passes your ear,  
Still the pride of your friends and reward of this verse  
Be it ever *your* blessing, that you may be *theirs*.  

And you own chosen comforts may heaven improve  
By show’ring its mercies on those you best love.  
Tho’ future attachments your feelings engage  
Still the friends of your youth be the friends of your age.  
In the bosom of kindness thus may you remain  
And heaven avert you should e’er feel the pain  
As chords twin’d round the heart but to sunder again  
But may time as it proferrs new blossoms of joy  
None cherished before, take away or destroy  
And long may you be, as you ever *have* been  
The bright little sun-beam that gladdens the scene.
