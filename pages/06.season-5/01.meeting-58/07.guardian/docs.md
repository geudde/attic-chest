##### Address for the Opening of the Attic Chest

Dec. 1812

Hark I hear the tempest roar,  
&emsp;Hark the rain and driving hail  
Summer’s cheerless reign is o’er  
&emsp;Gloomy King December, hail!  
Oh how many view with gladness  
&emsp;Summer’s vaunted roses blooming  
Oh how many view with sadness  
&emsp;Wintry clouds the welkin glooming  
Oh how few like me, so gaily  
Dark December, thus will hail ye.  

Now the rose and jasmine turning  
&emsp;Now the lily’s bloom is fled  
But the laurel brightly shining  
&emsp;Lifts thro’ storms and snow its head  
Brighter green its boughs adorning  
&emsp;See the favourite of Apollo  
Bids from lighter themes returning  
&emsp;You the bright example follow  
Waking from inglorious slumbers  
Pour again your magic numbers.

Hark obedient to the call  
&emsp;Friends again around me prest,  
And with looks of transport all,  
&emsp;Hail the *opening* of the *Chest.*  
Joy illumes the well known faces  
&emsp;Every eye more brightly glances  
While amid her sister Graces  
&emsp;Now the Editress advances  
Stored with many a votive offer  
Opes the consecrated Coffer.  

As the last in sense and spirit,  
&emsp;Every former year surpassed  
So may this in sterling merit  
&emsp;Brighter still, excel the last.  
Future years to this succeeding  
&emsp;Still with added lustre shining  
Every year the past exceeding  
&emsp;For your brows fresh laurels twining  
Till the Attic Chest in story  
Swells the note of Albion’s Glory.

Oh my friends ’tis yours to say  
&emsp;Must these hopes I fondly nourish  
Now forgotten pass away,  
&emsp;And your Chest no longer flourish.  
No! that burst of indignation  
&emsp;From so hard a fate secures me  
And that smile of approbation  
&emsp;Of your firm support assures me,  
Place on us you say reliance  
We to time will bid defiance.
