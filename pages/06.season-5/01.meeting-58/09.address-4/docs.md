<div class="author">Miss Porden</div>

The Chest unfolds — a stream of dazzling light  
Dispels the darkness of a polar night!  
My ears already catch the joyful sound  
Of welcome friends in social circle round:  
In gayer smiles each well-known face is dressed  
And purer pleasure fills each tuneful breast.  
And oh! with these what throngs aerial come  
By mortal eyes unseen, and fill the room!  
The flame of genius there serenely towers  
And sunbright fancy weaves her wreath of flowers!  
Wit shoots his pointed darts secure to wound  
Yet pleasure mingled with the smart is found:  
For Friendship’s hand the polished point supplied  
And kindly dipp’d it in her honied tide.  
There smiling Pleasure comes with frolic youth  
Nor shuns, as wont the piercing eye of Truth;  
And Science there, in simple garb array’d,  
Fancy and Taste adorn the rigid maid.  

Around the members, forms impassive throng  
That found ideal being in their song.  
Some boast, like Charity, a *num’rous* race,  
From varying climes adorn’d with varying grace:  
While some (oh! shameful truth!) in silence stand  
Nor own one straggler of the lovely band!  
See gay “Amanda” with her “Donald” hear  
“Philander” and the fair *“Recluse”* appear;  

In Scottish plaid is *“Lady Flora”* dressed  
And in her bower “sweet Annie” sinks to rest.  
See round the haughty *“Eborina”* rise  
Orlando’s and Lothario’s fruitless sighs:  
While, crown’d with willow, many a maid complains  
Robb’d by a *stranger* of *her faithless swains.*  
“Silvius” and “Cittus” in alternate lays  
Their *pastoral love* or *loveless idlesse* praise;  
With trembling rapture while the Spanish maid  
Hears in her moonlight bow’r “Alphonzo’s serenade!”

What countless troops of “Sylphs and Gnomes” arise,  
What valiant warriors meet my wond’ring eyes!  
See two brave “Henrys” court “Maria’s” smile  
But no mean envy stains their pleasing toil:  
In friendly rivalship they both agree  
From “Umbriel’s” power the injur’d maid to free.  

The “Unhappy Spinster” there with many a sigh  
(A fruitless search) explores “the soft blue eye:”  
In *Birchall’s shop* no *soft blue eye* is found  
And her fair bosom feels a cureless wound!  
While *Slenderwit* her favour asks in vain  
The slow *“West Indian”* and the gilded swain  
*“Antigynes”* and *“Alopex”* the sly  
And “Damon” seeks in her  — “his *Emily!”*

Then these behind what countless tribes appear  
That claimed the laurels of an earlier year!  
There Mars and Hermes with their attic war  
Of Heav’n’s bright sphere the beauteous order mar;  
There “Knights and Dames” for pow’r the contest wage,  
“Lysander” and “Camilla” there engage,  
And *Tancred*, *Timon*, and *Thalestris* rage!

The “Lawyer” there derides “Emilia’s” fears  
Her interesting grief and charming tears!  
Fam’d “Gotham’s” sons their wonted sapience show,  
And the gay “Rose” coquets with either beau:  
While *Tinderella* lights the fatal fire  
And lost in smoke poetic worlds expire;  
The “Muses lost” *Mercurius* seeks in vain,  
And soars “Roberto” to the lunar reign,  
While “Cupid” pleas’d to play the painter’s part,  
Touches the “Landscape” with unrivall’d art.

And oh! to claim sad Mem’ry’s mournful tear  
The shades of *friends departed* linger here!  
And *absent friends* in *mind* still hover near,  
Fill ev’ry **vacant seat** and anxious wait  
While **your** lips fix their tuneful offspring’s fate!  

My Patron’s! ever honour’d and belov’d,  
Whose cheering smiles my earlier years approv’d  
***Yourselves** bestowed* — ’tis yours to *raise* my fame  
Or with a breath annihilate my name!  
Another season claims your fostering care,  
In *you* I trust, nor feel the throb of fear;  
Secure through *you* my laurels still shall bloom  
Unchang’d thro’ many a Winter’s frigid gloom:  
That Indolence shall never sap their root,  
Nor Envy *blight* nor *Rivals* snatch the fruit;  
***Self-love*** invites you to the task, for know  
That as my laurels spread, your ***own*** shall grow!
