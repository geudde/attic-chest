##### Epistle the Third  

Oh Celia! fickle, faithless maid,  
Jest you, or have I falsely read —   
And can you thus inconstant prove  
Forgetful of your former love.  
Yes — howsoe’er by you denied  
Once for Albertus Celia sighed,  
Once when the gentle youth drew nigh  
Beamed brighter light from Celia’s eye  
And deepened on her cheek the dye.  
No voice so pleasing to her ear  
No gift from *other* hands so dear.  
Then what Adonis in your breast  
Now claims the share he one possessed?  
The Captain, young, and smart, and gay,  
Does he entice your heart away?  
Alas! too oft these warriors prove  
Sad recreant to their vows of love,  
Their chain ere Hymen’s hand has seal’d  
Mars often calls them to the field  
Attracted by some foreign dame  
They soon neglect their former flame  
Or often widowed Love must mourn  
O’er Truth and Valour’s timeless Urn.  
Then Oh! my friend your heart recall  
Albertus well deserves it all  
Firm as the rock, his love reward  
Nor for a scarlet coat discard.  
&emsp;But since you ne’er his presence name  
Perchance ’tis *absence* cools your flame,  
Tho’ love should ever be the same,  
Or burn in absence still more bright  
As stars upon a moonless night.  
&emsp;But long ere this, perhaps my friend  
My wish my *lecture* at an end,  
Tho’ watchful friendship still reproves  
With keenest lash, whom most she loves,  
&emsp;So now a sprightlier note I’ll sound  
To sing of fashion’s changeful sound.  
&emsp;O Novelty! whose ample sway  
The sage, the simple, grave, and gay  
Poor, wealthy, young, and old obey.  
Oh thou whose form is ever-changing  
Thro’ science, art, and nature ranging  
A poet, chemist, for or cit  
Aladdin’s lamp, or Busby’s wit!  
A warrior dressed in ancient mail  
A Coates, a cossack, or a whale  
A charlatan with projects dire  
To see the wond’ring Thames on fire  
A ghost, an eagle, or a sword,  
And still in every form adored.  
While daily severed whence they grew  
Self-formed, thy hydra heads renew,  
How may I paint in feeble strain  
The glories of they varied reign  
Where in this town, thy fav’rite court  
Such myriads at thy call resort.  
&emsp;And where, my Celia, shall I choose  
My subject, that it *may* be *news*.  
The public prints will best declare  
The events of politics and war.  
How at the opera, t’other night  
Each lady fainted with affright  
When the assailants big with rage  
In sable phalanx stormed the stage  
And the poor ghosts of Frenchmen dead  
Before th’avenging *black legs* fled.  
Some scene where Laura bore a part  
Will better please her Celia’s heart.  
&emsp;Olinda’s fête demands the song  
And can I ponder here so long  
All was so elegant, so neat  
So well arranged, and so complete  
Magnificence, yet ruled by taste  
Appears in every part confessed.  
The spacious hall, tho’ simply grand,  
Art decked, but with a sparing hand  
That her full banquet of delight  
Might burst more splendid on the sight.  
There richest odours breathe around  
And music lends a soften’d sound  
Reflected from the room beyond,  
Where the full concert poured along  
Or Emma raised her sweetest song.
