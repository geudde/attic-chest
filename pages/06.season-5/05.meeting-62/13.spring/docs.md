Again sweet spring delights the laughing earth,  
&emsp;With verdure clothes the grove, with flow’rs the vale,  
To lumb’ring nature gives a second birth,  
&emsp;Blooms on each tree, and breathes in ev’ry gale.  

Still in yon cloud the ev’ning crimson flows  
&emsp;As light it floats o’er ether’s boundless scene,  
Like that bright hue remember’d pleasure throws  
&emsp;O’er the pure azure of a mind serene.  

Till where yon mountains mingle with the skies  
&emsp;Their loftiest summits catch the ling’ring beam,  
First on those heights the morning sun shall rise  
&emsp;And longest there the moon’s soft lustre gleam.  

The feather’d choir still tune their ev’ning song,  
&emsp;And who on such a lovely scene can gaze  
Nor, fill’d with holy joy, like them prolong  
&emsp;The varied notes of Piety and Praise?

Hence metaphysic eyes — I care not why  
&emsp;Yon varied landscape glads my ravished sight,  
Why yon warm tints impart a livelier joy  
&emsp;Then the chill horrors of a starless night.  

Why when on nature’s wide expanse I gaze,  
&emsp;Earth and its joys or sorrows I despise,  
My thoughts unfetter’d as the solar rays  
&emsp;In holy transports soar above the skies.  

As children oft will break some fav’rite toy,  
&emsp;To know whate’er its polished <span data-tippy="ink blot" class="green">[???]</span> contains,  
Seeking its cause, your pleasure you destroy  
&emsp;Yet waste in vain your ineffectual pains.  

While you the rose of happiness resign,  
&emsp;Its parent tree still anxious to explore,  
And find alone the thorn — still be it mine  
&emsp;To know I’m happy, and to know no more.

And far from me be those whose jaundiced souls  
&emsp;To all things give their melancholy hue:  
Where now its peaceful tide yon river rolls,  
&emsp;Whose minds alone the wintry torrent view.  

Who where yon mountains stretch their length’ning chain  
&emsp;Can see no beauty on their *barren* brows,  
At noon of Phoebus’ scorching ray complain  
&emsp;That genial ray that life and light bestows.  

Like passing clouds reflected in the tide  
&emsp;Who deem all pleasure but a shadow vain,  
Illusion ever; by a breath destroy’d  
&emsp;Or past and vanish’d ere you look again.  

What tho’ yon rising stream that mead o’erflow’d,  
&emsp;’Tis thence its herbage drew its brighter dyes;  
A richer nectar for her fragrant load  
&emsp;The thyme-clad mountain to the bee supplies.

Take from yon firmament its glorious sun,  
&emsp;And where is earth and all its beauty fled?  
Its jarring seeds to second chaos run,  
&emsp;A joyless scene, to life and pleasure dead.  

If earthly pleasure be a shadow vain  
&emsp;And fleeting like a summer’s cloud away,  
It is the shadow of her purer reign  
&emsp;In the bright regions of eternal day.  

Still be it mine amid life’s stormy course,  
&emsp;To catch the transient beam that shines serene;  
Tho’ thorns unnumber’d guard her fairest flow’rs,  
&emsp;To pluck them gaily as they bloom between.  

If fortune grant me all my heart desire,  
&emsp;Or plunge me deeply in the sea of care,  
Oh may I still in trembling hope aspire  
&emsp;The sunshine of that cloudless day to share.
