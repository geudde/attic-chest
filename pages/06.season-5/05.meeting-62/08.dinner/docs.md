Mr Editor  

As the Society of which you are the able Generalissimo occasionally love a laugh even at the expense of the learned professions, I have sent the enclosed “Jeu d’esprit” as an attack on their risible faculties.  

It was occasioned by the serious loss to the church of a good Saturday’s dinner from the circumstance of a court in one of our large towns having sat to so late and hour, by the anxiety of the lawyers to get all their business done, that the dignitaries of the church who had been invited to partake of the feast that usually succeeds on such legal labours, found it necessary to creep home dinnerless to bed, or at least only such as their own cupboards could afford and unattended with the pomp and circumstance of a public feast, and I am very sure that many members of your Society are sufficiently admirers of the Epicurean as well as of the other distinguished sects of philosophy, heartily to sympathize with, however they may be inclined to laugh at the diappointment of the Rev. Gentlemen.

Yours

Epicuretto

In full uniform, the turtle to storm  
The church and the army had met  
They waited till five, with hopes still alive  
For in truth they were pretty sharp set.  

At six some few scowl’d, at seven all growl’d  
Their stomachs at eight “Cupboard cried”  
At nine in a pet they went home for a whet  
And swore that their patience was tried.  

At last with a maw, as hungry as law  
The court breaks up half after nine  
At ten as I ween, with appetites keen  
They sat down in order to dine.  

But each Reverend Guest had crept home to rest  
With stomach that had not a full pit  
And some sad rogues say that all the next day  
A languor pervaded the pulpit.
