##### Advertisement  

“The Pleasures of Sentiment” is a title that sufficiently explains to the refined mind the nature of the poem which bears it, and the author will only slightly mention the nature of his general plan.  

He proposes to illustrate his subject in the manner in which Imagination, Memory, and Hope have been illustrated by his illustrious predecessors, treating in the first part of Sentiment as distinguished from Love, and in the second of Love as united to Sentiment.  

He subjoins the opening of the poem as a specimen of the manner in which he has executed his design.

##### Part the First

O Sentiment, sweet soother of the soul  
That hold’st the melting mind in soft control!  
O Sentiment, enlivener of the heart  
That canst to mortals bliss divine impart!  
O Sentiment, sweet softener of sad care  
To dainty cakes that turnst the coarsest fare!  
Balm of our sorrows! sweet’ner of our joys!  
Without thee every earthly pleasure clogs;  
And with thy healing hand to bring relief  
Sharp sorrow turns to balm-distilling grief.  
O Sentiment! thy heartfelt powers I sing  
And frame for fervid flight a scarce-fledged wing.  
Aid me, then, power immortal to display  
Thy blush-impurpled graces to the day:  
Be thou at once my subject and my muse,  
And in each line thy thrilling touch infuse;  
Teach me to draw from flinty breasts a sigh  
To fill with tears the yet unmoistened eye,  
And wake the heart to rapturous ecstasy!  
Come Sentiment and fill my teeming soul  
Whether my eyes with thought impassioned roll,  
Or bend in solemn sadness down to Earth —   
Oh aid each glowing thought, each tuneful verse’s birth.
