##### Strophe

O thou, th’oppressor of a struggling world!  
&emsp;Thou by the iron sceptre known  
&emsp;Who oft hast fix’d thine adamantine throne,  
&emsp;And, in thy lawless night, a destined day  
&emsp;O’er prostrate nations held thy sway,  
Till by Almighty vengeance hurled  
&emsp;&emsp;Down from thy guilty height;  
&emsp;Then for a space sweet liberty  
&emsp;Uprises blithe; th’oppress’d go free;  
&emsp;&emsp;But soon thy sweeping flight  
&emsp;&emsp;Returns with gather’d might,  
And o’er the subject air thy standard waves unfurl’d  
&emsp;How shall I paint thee, gloomy, grim, and vast,  
&emsp;A form that o’er a thousand realms can cast  
&emsp;&emsp;The fearful shade of terror’s dismal night;  
&emsp;An arm that nought can scape, a piercing eye  
&emsp;Of pow’r the deed most secret to espy,  
&emsp;&emsp;An ear that ev’ry whisper hears aright;  
A heart no plaints can pierce, no woes can move,  
A steady purpose that no change can prove,  
Feelings self-center’d, dead to social joy and love.  

##### Antistrophe

Thee, Tyranny, the elder ages saw  
&emsp;When the replenish’d earth began,  
&emsp;The deluge o’er, to teem with Man,  
&emsp;The mighty ones, who toil’d for fame,  
&emsp;By building sought a deathless name,  
&emsp;And Babel’s tow’rs they rais’d with one accord,  
&emsp;A mighty hunter then before the Lord.  
Nimrod arose the gathering tribes to awe,  
And wide o’er Shinar’s plains spread sov’reign rule and law.  
&emsp;Though to presumptuous Man it was not given  
&emsp;To build a tow’r whose top should reach to heav’n,  
&emsp;And speech confound’d sent their tribes to roam  
&emsp;Each through the world to seek a distant home,  
&emsp;Yet Shinar’s plain was still dominion’s seat,  
&emsp;And Tyrants ruled in Babylon the great.  
&emsp;Behold Semiramis, whose mighty sway  
&emsp;Afric and India’s distant realms obey —   
&emsp;&emsp;See from the still-famed heroine springs  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;A long tyrannic line  
&emsp;&emsp;Of now forgotten “Kings of Kings”  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Once honor’d as divine.  
&emsp;But chief o’er Egypt’s fam’d mysterious land  
&emsp;With baleful superstition hand in hand,  
&emsp;&emsp;Most meet companion, she of all thy way  
&emsp;For ages, faded now in hist’ry’s page,  
&emsp;Whose might relics wonder yet engage  
&emsp;&emsp;Thou heldst dread pow’r, an undisputed sway.  
How did thy minions human joys despoil!  
&emsp;To build, in time-defying strength, a tomb,  
&emsp;The bones of some now unknown king t’inhume,  
What countless myriads died of never ceasing toil.

##### Epode  

&emsp;Yet not alone in barb’rous climes,  
&emsp;&emsp;Or where the many, slaves by birth,  
&emsp;Without a murmur at their crimes,  
&emsp;&emsp;Obey’d the few, the mighty of the earth,  
Tyrannic pow’r was known in antient times:  
&emsp;E’en in fair Greece and mighty Rome,  
&emsp;&emsp;Where ev’ry social virtue flourish’d,  
&emsp;Where liberty had fix’d her home,  
&emsp;&emsp;And arms and arts alike were blest,  
With freedom, wealth and fame while some were blest,  
Oppression’s grinding chain enthrall’d the rest.  
&emsp;See in each fam’d republic state  
&emsp;Where all were free and all were great  
&emsp;(As now the modern patriot raves)  
&emsp;A num’rous host of suffering slaves.  
&emsp;See the poor helots doomed to toil  
&emsp;Mid grief and scorn on Sparta’s soil  
&emsp;See Rome her conquer’d states oppress  
&emsp;With cold rapacious haughtiness.  
&emsp;And then behold, the scene to close,  
&emsp;The mighty fabric which arose.  
&emsp;From democratic ages strife,  
&emsp;Propose of human woe and life  
With an imperial race of tyrants crown’d  
And Rome’s dread master rule the world around.  

##### 2nd Strophe  

Mother of Empire! Italy’s fair queen  
&emsp;What wond’rous changes hast thou known  
&emsp;Since ’mid thy sev’nfold hills was fix’d a throne!  
&emsp;Thro’ all the revolutions of thy state  
&emsp;The nurse of tyrants mark’d by fate,  
Kings, consuls, emperors, by turns thou’st seen;  
&emsp;Goths and barbaric chiefs;  
&emsp;And sov’reign pontiffs from St Peter’s chair  
&emsp;Their will as Heav’n’s own high behest declare:  
&emsp;And now, to crown thy griefs,  
Thy beauteous relics spoil’d by plund’rers keen  
Thyself to foreign tyranny a vassal mean.  
&emsp;But sure the genius I essay to sing  
&emsp;Ne’er wav’d so high and wide his lordly wing  
&emsp;As clad in purple stole and triply crown’d;  
&emsp;The body erst he could alone control,  
&emsp;But then his gather’d pow’r enslav’d the soul,  
&emsp;And priestcraft ruled the ’nighted world around.  
Lo, kings themselves before the papal throne  
Submissive bend, and pow’r superior own,  
Though by opinion’s force the Pontiff rules alone!

##### 2nd Epode

&emsp;Thus, tyranny, thy mighty race  
&emsp;&emsp;Was seen through ancient times,  
&emsp;And still thy whelming course we trace,  
&emsp;&emsp;By misery and crimes.  
&emsp;Thy footsteps ev’ry soil have press’d,  
&emsp;&emsp;Thy wing swept ev’ry sea;  
&emsp;Britain alone kind Heav’n has blest  
&emsp;&emsp;With peace and liberty.

&emsp;But see mid yonder northern snows,  
&emsp;Where battle’s rage more fiercely glows,  
&emsp;Where smould’ring cities sink in fire,  
&emsp;Where various hosts on hosts expire,  
&emsp;Where famine and resistless cold  
&emsp;Subdue the strong, appal the bold,  
&emsp;What glories spring to view!  
&emsp;And is the vision true?  
&emsp;Yes, the rav’ning vulture’s flight  
&emsp;Now has reach’d its utmost height,  
&emsp;And now he flags with broken pinion!  
&emsp;Now, tyranny, thy last dire minion  
&emsp;Schemes of wide rule no more shall plan  
&emsp;O’er all the subject race of Man,  
&emsp;But bend his ev’ry art and force  
&emsp;To stem the rising torrent’s course,  
&emsp;That, bursting o’er each barrier realm,  
&emsp;Threatens his empire to o’erwhelm.  

O thou Supreme! that o’er a sinful world  
&emsp;Sendst forth the conq’ror, thy avenging rod  
&emsp;To scourge the nations that forgot their God;  
&emsp;Teach them to own thy pow’r and worship thee,  
&emsp;Then bid them from the tyran’ts yoke be free,  
And on his guilty head be ample vengeance hurl’d!
