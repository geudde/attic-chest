<div class="author">Miss Porden</div>

How often my lyre, on this morning of love  
&emsp;To thy name has rung loudly, but still rung in vain,  
Nor my strains nor my truth thy cold bosom can move  
&emsp;To hear thy sad victim, and pity his pain.

Not the woods of proud Latium, more frequent the name  
&emsp;Of fair Amaryllis were taught to resound,  
The tall groves of Oxford have echoes thy fame  
&emsp;“Eborina” the hills of Llangollen rebound.  

Oh think ere the roses of youth shall be past  
&emsp;In the gay spring of life that still brilliantly bloom,  
In its winter how dreary and chill is the blast  
&emsp;If Love warm not the air and enliven the gloom.  

Orlando
