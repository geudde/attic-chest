> The Pen’s Address to the Successful Candidate 

Formed through the fields of air to range  
We suffer no inglorious change  
Since gentle Ellen signs our doom  
To lend our aid to Fancy’s plume  
Through Wit’s etherial realms to stray  
And bask in kind Apollo’s ray.  

No mortal artist’s hand prepared  
These engines of the favoured Bard  
These from the stores of Nature lent  
Are for her best-loved children meant,  
Accept our aid — let Nature guide  
The power her beauty has supplied  
Then *We*, from Æther’s tenants riven  
May reach again our native heaven.
