“Beauty without smiles is like heaven without the sun.”

**Memorandum** This has been said *twice* to Emily Echowell who is too silly to understand it; but it will do for *Saccharissa*.  

“Speak of yourself; for those who speak *well* should always speak on the *best* subject.” A mighty pretty saying from many occasions.  

**Mem.** Must not use it too often to Lady Belle or Mrs Nettletop, for fear they should think me *in earnest*.  

&emsp;When Love is rash and Fortune kind,  
&emsp;Fortune and Love, they say, are *blind*;  
&emsp;But Nature veils *your* eyes to shew  
&emsp;That Beauty may be sightless too.  

This will do for Miss Croaker who has *bleared* eyes, and looks as if she expected me to *say something*.

**N:B:** I wonder who wrote these lines under St Agnes’s portrait? — but they may pass for mine.  

“Presents gracefully given are the most persuasive ways of courtship” says Ovid. **N:B:** My grandmother’s watch-case will be a pretty cheap gift to Miss Squib as a porringer for her lap-dog.  

“Bo, bo, bo!” is the chorus of Greek lovesong. It may be dangerous therefore, to say BO to a goose.  

“The company of men wants *a certain softness* — the company of women, *without you*, wants everything!” A pretty sentence, but rather *too particular*: it might raise *unwarranted expectations.*

&emsp;By turns a mortal and his mate  
&emsp;Might govern in due season,  
&emsp;If Nature taught mankind to *prate*  
&emsp;And Woman how to *reason*.  

&emsp;But as it is, we helpless Men  
&emsp;Are worsted in the battle;  
&emsp;For oft we lose our *wits* — but when  
&emsp;Do Women lose their prattle?  

A good retort-courteous for Miss B. **N:B:** I owe her a quip, for while I was merry last night, she said Lucian must have been wrong when he supposed *apes could not laugh.*

&emsp;Here Nature doth her works display  
&emsp;In wonders huge and great:  
&emsp;Besides there are large clumps of trees  
&emsp;Which earth do OPARATE!  

**Mem.** May serve for the 1st stanza of my descriptive sonnet on Dovedale.
