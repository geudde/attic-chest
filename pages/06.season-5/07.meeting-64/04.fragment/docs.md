’Tis true: the rose has left thy cheek  
&emsp;Thine eyes no longer shine;  
And vulgar soul in vain may seek  
&emsp;The charm so priz’d by mine:  
But there is one which loves to trace  
&emsp;Amidst the ruins of thy face,  
&emsp;Departed Beauty’s shrine:  
There is an eye that could not bear  
To lose the light still living there!  


2

Yet it is sad to think those eyes  
&emsp;Now dim and sightless grown,  
Had once the beam which love supplies  
&emsp;And shone on me alone:  
But sweeter ’tis to mourn thee blind  
Than from unclouded eyes to find  
&emsp;The ray of kindness flown  
O! it had been a pang too dire  
To see that cherish’d ray retire!  

3

And thou art blest; — for life’s decay  
&emsp;Thine eye shall never see;  
Nor mark the cold and blighted sway  
&emsp;Of envious Time in me:  
Thou canst not watch my transient sleep  
Nor grieve while by thy side I weep  
&emsp;For joys withheld from thee; —   
Thou seest not how I hate the light  
Which brings no blessing to thy sight!  

4

Yet those dim eyes a speech possess  
&emsp;Which Beauty’s voice excels;  
The pow’r of brightest eyes is less  
&emsp;Than in thy darkness dwells.  
A light which asks no sunbeam’s aid,  
Like stars that reign in midnight shade,  
&emsp;Thy earthly gloom dispels; —   
Fate may thy mortal sight remove  
But gives thee still the eye of love!
