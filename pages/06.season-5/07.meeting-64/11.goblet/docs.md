> Lines on drinking out of a goblet, which a lady had previously used.  

Where the goblet’s crystal lip  
Challenges the transient sip,  
Deep I drink the flowing bowl,  
While rapture fills my tranced soul.  
Ask you why so deep I drink?  
Why still I hover o’er the brink?  
Because those lips so red, so fair  
Have left a kiss commingling there.  
Whose sweets the sparkling juice refine  
And into nectar change the wine:  
’Tis why I deeply quaff the bowl,  
While rapture fills my tranced soul!
