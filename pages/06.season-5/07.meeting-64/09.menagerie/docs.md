Our lapdogs and monkeys, our squirrels and cats,  
Our parrots, canaries and larks,  
Have furnished amusements to many old maids,  
And once in a while to young sparks.  

In Heaven, where time passes heavily too,  
When the gods have no subject to take on,  
*Jove* calls for an eagle he keeps in a mew,  
As an old English baron his falcon.  

He lets it jump up, on his sofa and chair,  
And dip its crooked beak in his cup;  
And laughs when it pinches young Ganimede’s ear;  
Or eats his ambrosia all up.

Queen *Juno* who fears from rough play a mishap,  
Keeps peacocks with rainbowy tails;  
And when she’s disposed to grudge Saturn his nap,  
Their screaming or screeching ne’er fails:  

Fair *Venus* most willing coaxes the doves,  
That coo, coo and wed on her wrist;  
The sparrow her chambermaid *Aglae** loves,  
As often, is fondled and kissed.
