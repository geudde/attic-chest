<div class="author">Miss Richardson</div>

Edinburgh March 1813

Written by S.R. Jun<sup>r.</sup>

For *Howd’yedoing* ill are fit  
The accents sadden’d by *Goodby’ing*,  
Or to hail learning, verse, and wit,  
Dull strains in broken measures dying.

Fancy, to youth’s delighted hand,  
Her choicest flow’rs is still presenting,  
Which time, in sovereign command,  
Snatches with vigor unrelenting.  

Thus time goes on, whilst time shall live,  
Delay his weapons oft concealing,  
And, when we’ve no more flow’rs to give,  
At last, ourselves he thinks of stealing.  

But round your circle as he flies  
May time his ancient charter breaking,  
In honor of the good and wise,  
Be *giving* flow’rs instead of *taking*.

The above trifling attempt was written soon after parting from friends equally beloved and kind. The expressions of *Howdyedoing* and *Goodbyeing* are borrow’d from the Hon. W. Spencer’s beautiful little poem of Howdyedo and Goodbye.
