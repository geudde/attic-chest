Come reach me old Anacreon’s lyre  
&emsp;For wintery storms are hovering near,  
And soon shall chill the autumnal fire  
&emsp;That gleams on life's declining year.  

Then let me wake the rapturous shell,  
&emsp;With cords of sweet rememberance strung;  
While grateful Age delights to tell  
&emsp;Of joys that glow'd when life was young.  

And, let the languid pulse forego  
&emsp;The throb that Fancy’s flight inspires,  
Anacreon’s flowing cup bestow,  
&emsp;And urge with wine the waning fires.  

But temper me the Teian bowl!  
&emsp;And chasten me the Teian shell!  
The visions that in memory roll  
&emsp;And such as Nature's bosom swell.  

If, while the mantling goblet flows,  
&emsp;I sing of Beauty’s charms divine;  
The breast that heaves, the cheek that glows,  
&emsp;And beaming like stars that shine;  

The draft on Memory’s tablet true  
&emsp;That pictures each entrancing grace,  
Without a frown shall Stella view,  
&emsp;Or there some lov’d memorial trace;  

And when with high-enraptur’d air,  
&emsp;My lavish verse shall most commend,  
Shall find her youthful image there,  
&emsp;Or, in each portrait, view a friend.  

Then reach me old Anacreon’s lyre,  
&emsp;And temper me Anacreon’s bowl;  
That youthful joy’s remember’d fire  
&emsp;May Age’s numbing frost control.
