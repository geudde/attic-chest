> Lines composed on a Mail Coach in a stormy night addressed to a young lady

From those we love “’tis death to part”  
&emsp;’Tis death to leave my *home* and *you*  
So cries full many a faithful heart  
&emsp;But *who* shall prove the assertion *true*  
To prove its *truth* the task be mine  
&emsp;For what is death? Ye sages say;  
’Tis when the soul, that spark divine  
&emsp;Leaves its dull tenement of clay  
And seeks the blissful seats above  
&emsp;Its destined *home*, its *native sky*;  
If this be *so*, from those we love  
&emsp;Well may we say “’tis death to fly:”  
For while the steeds with flying feet  
&emsp;Bear thro the night my earthly form  
Unconscious of the driving sleet,  
&emsp;The piercing cold, the raging storm,  
My every thought, my mind, my soul,  
&emsp;Scorns with this drooping *frame* to roam  
And turns to seek its favorite goal  
&emsp;Its paradise, its heaven, its home.
