Oh why, so sweetly smiling,  
&emsp;Those eyes are turn’d on me,  
The captive soul beguiling  
&emsp;That struggles to be free.  
Since frowns would sooner smother  
&emsp;My ardent hopeless love?  
Your heart you give another,  
&emsp;Let me your hatred prove.

For Pit (sweet deceiver!)  
&emsp;Adds fuel to the flame,  
Which burns more bright than ever  
&emsp;Tho’ hopeless in its aim:  
Then, Mary, look less kindly;  
&emsp;Oh cease to smile on me!  
Teach me to love less blindly,  
&emsp;Since I’m not lov’d by thee!
