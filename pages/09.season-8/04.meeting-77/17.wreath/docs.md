When the Hermits turn’d Cupid out of doors  
&emsp;In a cynical fit sublime,  
He gather’d in haste his flowery stores  
&emsp;And ran to meet flying TIME.  

Time laugh’d when he saw the urchin’s haste —   
&emsp;“Why, whither so fast?” he cried;  
“When flow’rs are gather’d and butterflies chas’d  
&emsp;My measureless speed you chide.”  

“O gentle Time, more tardily tread  
&emsp;While my first spring-garland blooms!  
I’ll weave these primroses round your head  
&emsp;And these snowdrops in your plumes.”  

Love gave the Wreath from his flowery store  
&emsp;To Tempt old Time’s delay,  
But Time flew faster than before  
&emsp;When he bore the prize away.  

First Beauty’s lily and half-blown rose  
&emsp;In his withering grasp decay’d;  
And the frail narcissus which Folly chose  
&emsp;He left in the dust to fade.  

Whim’s gay convolvulus chang’d its hue  
&emsp;When his cold hand touch’d the Wreath;  
He shook from the heart’s-ease its honey-dew  
&emsp;And its fragrance ceas’d to breathe.  

The roses by Love’s own fingers tied  
&emsp;Ere another hour were dead;  
And the sweet-briar-leaves by Wit supplied  
&emsp;Time scatter’d as he fled. 

The canker of Shame and the thorn of Grief  
&emsp;’Midst the dying flow’rs were seen  
While only the modest myrtle-leaf  
&emsp;Retain’d its triumphant green:  

That myrtle by Truth and Reason grac’d,  
&emsp;Was pluck’d from Life’s fairest tree;  
And TIME the unfading trophy plac’d  
&emsp;In the crown of ETERNITY.
