Oh why did he go!  
&emsp;I meant not to refuse him,  
How could he think so?  
&emsp;For worlds I would not lose him;  
But alas! he’s flown from me,  
Boasting that his heart is free,  
And I ne’er shall see  
&emsp;His sweet face again —   
&emsp;&emsp;Again, again,  
&emsp;His sweet face again.  
Oh silly! thus to lose  
&emsp;A heart once my own,  
His proferr’d hand refuse  
&emsp;To pine thus alone.  
Ah me, alone! — ah me, alone!

Oh what shall I do,  
&emsp;My lost swain to recover?  
I’d ever prove true,  
&emsp;All trifling should be over;  
And no more with frown or flaunt,  
Angry look or peevish taunt,  
His sly love to daunt  
&emsp;For yes, I’d say nay;  
&emsp;&emsp;Oh no! oh no!  
&emsp;No tricks I’d display.  
Then prithee, dearest Youth,  
&emsp;In pity return;  
Receive my plighted truth,  
&emsp;My penitence learn.  
Ah me, return! — ah me, return!
