The Associated Hermits and the Committee of Tabby Hall return their united acknowledgements to the Editor and Editress of the Attic Chest for the encouragement bestowed on their projected Lottery; and they beg leave to enclose fourteen tickets to be distributed among the ladies and gentlemen of the Attic Society. The holders of the tickets will be entitled to the prizes appropriated to their respective numbers as arranged in the sealed envelope.

Documents and vouchers will be sent with the prizes in a casket lent by the President of Tabby Hall for the occasion.
