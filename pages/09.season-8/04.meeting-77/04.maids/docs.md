The sun gleams on Lisbon’s tow’rs,  
And gilding fair Cintra’s bow’rs,  
His last bright rays o’er ocean shining  
&emsp;Are fast declining  
To western worlds inclining.  
&emsp;Oh sweet banks of Tejo’s stream,  
&emsp;&emsp;Where are scenes serener, fairer!  
&emsp;Oh sweet maids for poet’s theme  
&emsp;&emsp;Where are nymphs of beauty rarer!

2

With forms of grace like fairies light,  
With eyes that shine like planets bright,  
Thro’ orange groves by twilight playing,  
&emsp;Night’s reign delaying,  
See loveliest nymphs are straying.  
&emsp;Oh sweet banks of Tejo’s stream,  
&emsp;&emsp;Ever let me wander near ye!  
&emsp;Oh sweet maids for poet’s theme,  
&emsp;&emsp;Let your smiles for ever cheer me!

All lands their own dear maids extol,  
Love’s ruling pow’r confess’d by all;  
The prize of beauty each desiring,  
&emsp;To shine aspiring,  
Tho’ diff’rent charms admiring.  
&emsp;But our nymphs of olive hue,  
&emsp;&emsp;Oh they’re fairer than the fairest!  
&emsp;Their dark eyes outshine the blue,  
&emsp;&emsp;Theirs to me is beauty rarest!
