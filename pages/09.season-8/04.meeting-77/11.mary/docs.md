Sweet Babe! whose yes just opening on the day  
Scarce yet reveal the intellectual ray  
Whose looks can all thy mother’s cares beguile  
Tho’ yet scarce conscious of that mother’s smile  
Soon may those eyes, with livelier beam impart  
Each varied feeling of thy youthful heart  
Soon may they gaze upon thy mother’s face  
Until thine own has caught her every grace  
Like her thy lips in sweetest sounds dispense  
Veiled in the softest words, the strongest sense  
Like her in gentleness of mind, in form  
Of Sylphid grace in heart for ever warm  
In playful wit in purity of soul  
That ever feels, but never shows control  
And when matured thy frame, thy lovelier mind  
Like her in Hymen’s happiest bonds confined  
With all the gifts of favouring fortune blest  
But most content, which bids us prize the rest  
Then to o’erflowing, full will be thy store  
Of earthly bliss — I cannot wish the more.

The Fairy of the River
