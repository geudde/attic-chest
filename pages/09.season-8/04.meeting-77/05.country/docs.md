Thro’ a night of darkest sorrow  
&emsp;My lov’d country have I seen,  
When no hope of brighter morrow  
&emsp;O’er it shone with light serene;  
When despair each bosom rending,  
&emsp;Her free spirit seem’d to sleep,  
&emsp;&emsp;Or die in sending  
To heaven its murmurs sad and deep.

“Has her sun then set for ever,  
&emsp;His long race of glory o’er;  
Shall his rays relumine never  
&emsp;Lusitania’s wretched shore?”  
Thus the Patriot Bard lamenting  
&emsp;Forth in strains indignant broke,  
&emsp;&emsp;Deep curses venting  
Beneath th’ Oppressor’s iron yoke.

But how bright the morn was breaking   
&emsp;When fair Albion’s heroes came,  
And our sons from slumber waking  
&emsp;Kindled Freedom’s sacred flame!  
Oh ’twas light too pure and glorious  
&emsp;For the eyes of slaves to bear —   
&emsp;&emsp;Soon shouts victorious  
Our triumph to the world declare!
