Come, my love, the twilight star  
&emsp;Glistens o’er yon chestnut grove,  
And our swains, from toil at rest,  
&emsp;Fly to join the maids they love:  
Then, Zorayda, haste away,  
Without thee no scene is gay!

2

Hark, my love, what blithesome sounds  
&emsp;Float so sweetly on the air —   
From the village green they come,  
&emsp;Where our nymphs and swains repair:  
But, Zorayda, without thee  
Dull are gayest strains to me!

3

See, my love, they take their stand  
&emsp;For the gay bolero’s dance,  
Now they move with graceful bend,  
&emsp;Or with agile step advance:  
But, Zorayda, who like thee  
Glides in airy motion free?

Fleeting as the sunny gleam  
&emsp;Scudding o’er you mountain’s sides,  
When the passing clouds fly fast,  
&emsp;Are the hours that pleasure guides:  
Then, Zorayda, haste away!  
Pleasure flies while you delay
