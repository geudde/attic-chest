Calm contemplation! oh descend,  
And make my mind serene;  
Thy heavenly presence deign to lend,  
And sanctify this scene,  
I want to learn, I wish to know  
If *all* is vanity below.  
Say, shall *ambition* fire my breast  
And fill my vast desires,  
Can the high honors make me blest  
To which my heart aspires;  
For much alas! I wish to know,  
If *all* is vanity below.  

Can riches calm the troubled mind  
Can they all joys impart?  
Inform me Goddess, where to find  
A cordial for my heart,  
For greatly do I wish to know  
If all is vanity below.

Oh cannot love’s most holy flame,  
Eternal comforts bring;  
An union chaste can know no shame  
From thence true joy must spring;  
Oh tell me, for I long to know  
If *all* is vanity below.

Say shall I seek fair learning’s seat  
And cultivate the muse?  
Or to the silent shades retreat  
And nature’s page peruse?  
Vouchsafe to say, that I may know  
If all is vanity below?  

Does happiness with friendship dwell?  
That balsam to the soul  
Or does she seek the hermit’s cell  
And each vain thought control,  
Inform me pray, that I may know  
If all is vanity below  

*All* is *not* vanity below,  
(The Goddess sweetly said)  
You there may learn your God to know,  
And conquer every dread;  
I tell you this — that you may know  
All is not *vanity* below

To heal the sick, and wipe the tear  
From sorrow’s pallid cheek;  
To give to those who poor appear,  
The pittance that they seek;  
Do this, and I will let you know  
All is not vanity below

The orphans sigh, the widows moan  
In pity oh attend;  
And I will hear their dying groan,  
And God shall be their friend;  
And then be sure, that you shall know,  
*All* was not vanity below.
