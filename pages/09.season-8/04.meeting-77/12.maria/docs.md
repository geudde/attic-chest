<div class="author">Miss Porden</div>

Tho’ they frown may be keen as the blast of the sky  
Tho’ the ice is less cold than the glance of thine eye  
Tho’ thy breast where affection with fervour should glow  
Is more frozen more fair than the soft falling snow  
Yet hope rises fondly to bid me complain  
’Tis the morning of spring, and it wakes her again.

She says tho’ thy bosom be cold as the snow  
The germen of love it may foster below  
That the coldness which chills in thine eye maybe won  
To sparkle and melt in the rays of the sun  
That the breath of fond love o’er the blast may prevail  
Till its keenness be lost in the warmth of the gale.

Then one sunny ray to thy suitor dispense —   
’Tis St Valentines morn, and the change should commence.
