Time will not stay, for myrtle leaves    
Nor for the garland Fancy weaves    
Tho’ fairy hands the pencil bring    
And dip it in the hues of spring    
&emsp;Time will not stay.  
Yet round united hearts entwin’d    
That fairy wreath he loves to find    
Then from the bond he takes no flower    
But adds another every hour.  
&emsp;He passes flying.  
For well he knows that holy bond    
Shall bloom his earthly date beyond    
Till hope and joy their kingdom greet    
And death in chains at mercy’s feet    
&emsp;Himself lies dying.    
Time bids the minstrel’s brief wild rose    
In cold oblivion’s lap repose    
The links by vagrant Cupid spun    
The laurels by ambition won    
&emsp;His scythe shall sever    
But when he sees their trophies bound    
Bland virtue’s steadfast altar round    
He comes with downy wings to give    
His sacred seal and bids them live    
&emsp;With him for ever
