My lovely Zara, dearest weep no more    
Again thy Hassan sees his native shore    
For he whom love protects can safely go    
O’er Afric’s sands, or Chimborazo’s snow.  
  
Charmed by thy voice the winds forgot to rise    
It seem’d no ruder than thy tender sighs    
Those sighs which, forc’d to leave thee, firm tho’ griev’d    
My ear rejected, but my heart receiv’d.    
  
Fearless I met the Simoom’s arid blast,    
Or flying columns of the sandy waste    
Harmless o’er me the hot Sirocco flew    
Or death’s chill wind, the icy Sarzar blew.  
  
I heard the fierce hyena laugh around    
The jackal moaning o’er the game he found    
The lion eyed me as he roam’d for prey    
But only growl’d, and sullen slunk away.
