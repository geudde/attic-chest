Dear Editress  
  
As you are a connoisseur in Valentines, I cannot help sending you the enclosed beautiful lines, which I have accidentally discovered to have been addressed last year to my sister Sarah. In offering these M.S. lines for the amusement of the Attic Society, I am guilty of no break of confidence, as the shy girl never would own the real cause of her predilection for everything Eastern.

Yes! when wintry blasts decay    
And winter’s snows dissolve away    
I love to see the snowdrop rise    
First produce of the changing skies.    
  
I love it for the promise given    
Of warmer gales and brighter heaven    
But who when ardent summer glows    
Would change it for the blushing rose.  
  
The fragrant woodbine gadding wild    
Or May, the summer’s earliest child    
Or e’en though niggard of perfume    
The Thalmia’s bright and lavish bloom.    
  
When flowers are rife, how oft ’tis seen    
We slight the glossy evergreen    
But when the feathery snows descend    
We hail it as a long lost friend.    
  
The earliest violet of the spring    
Delicious odour seems to fling    
But when a thousand scent the air    
We scarcely feel the sweets they bear.    
  
Hope bids the snowdrop fairer bloom    
Hope lends the violets mild perfume    
And hope in winter loves to see    
The laurel bloom, her chosen tree.    
  
She loves, like her, to see it last    
And brave the frost, the rain, the blast    
The comfort of the darkest hour    
The brightest in the leafless bower.
