**E**&hairsp;re the world was created and order began,    
**L**&hairsp;aws enacted to rule and to civilize man;    
**E**&hairsp;ngulf’d and entomb’d in an unfathom’d deep,    
**A**&hairsp;lone Father <span class="small">CHAOS</span> lay snugly asleep.    
**N**&hairsp;ought dreaming what feats he’d to act, the first peep,    
**O**&hairsp;r what a fine farce would appear in our time    
**R**&hairsp;ais’d by <span class="small">ELEANOR PORDEN</span> in musical rhyme.    
  
**P**&hairsp;our forth all ye fountains, fresh streams to her fame    
**O**&hairsp;’er each temple on Earth and in air write her name    
**R**&hairsp;ear altars, heap incense, eternize the blaze    
**D**&hairsp;ue to nature’s new Laureat her Lyre and her Lays,    
**E**&hairsp;ach element hasten its gifts to supply,    
**N**&hairsp;or the laurel to <span class="small">ELEANOR PORDEN</span> deny.
