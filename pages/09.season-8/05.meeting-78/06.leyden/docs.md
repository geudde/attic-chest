Ere Learning’s sacred beam expanded far,    
&emsp;Shone like the sun diffused o’er every clime,    
Beamed thro’ the darkness many a scatter’d star.  
  
With beacon light, the glory of the time    
&emsp;To Science vowed, proud Leyden’s walls arose    
Still fresh in youth, exulting in their prime    
  
’Twas night, and all were sunk in soft repose,    
&emsp;Unwrinkled now the furrow’d face of Care,    
E’en Avarice slept, and Love forgot his woes.  
  
Alone the midnight bell alarm’d the air    
&emsp;And to her vigils rose each cloister’d dame    
While heavy slumber crush’d the half-form’d prayer.    
  
Yet still to Leyden’s Sage no slumber came    
&emsp;Tho’ chill the blast, the fading fire was low.    
And in the socket burn’d th’ expiring flame.    
  
Thick were the crucibles in many a row    
&emsp;Enrich’d with earth, or gem, or precious ore,    
Here black with fire, here white as virgin snow.    
  
Dark stood Cunaeus ’mid his cumbrous store    
&emsp;Of phials with hermetic wisdom closed,    
With names of snaky volume labell’d o’er,    
  
Such as Prince Geber to the world disclos’d.    
&emsp;(Arabian Sage! thy name Gibraltar bears)    
Such words had Recker and Van Helmont posed.  
  
Oh see! the fruit of long laborious cares    
&emsp;Yon retorts, rich with loads of nameless wealth,    
Earths, metals, yet unknown, unchristen’d airs.    
  
See round yon furnace, grave of youth and health,    
&emsp;Whose murky fumes now tinge Cunaeus’ brow,    
And sallow cheeks, whose roses but by stealth    
  
To that red flame their short existence owe.    
&emsp;See round its brink what countless treasures lie    
And speak of future danger, toil and woe.  
  
But most that globe of sulphur meets the eye    
&emsp;Revolving swiftly on its ligneous pole,    
See from its orb th’ electric sparkles fly!    
  
But what bright thought Cunaeus, fires thy soul?    
&emsp;A nail within his phial held with art,    
He bids the globe in quicker circles roll.  
  
It takes the charge but whence that sudden start    
&emsp;Why sinks Cunaeus lifeless on the floor    
Methinks that piercing scream has burst his heart.    
  
Fainting he lies, and speaks and moves no more    
&emsp;In greasy flannels wrapt, and aged dame    
All pale and trembling, oped the study door.    
  
“And was it hence the sound of terror came!    
&emsp;Is this the doom ungrateful science gave!”    
Lifeless she sunk upon his lifeless frame.    
  
But Science will’d not that her faithful slave    
&emsp;Should die, the victim of a zeal so true,    
She came, and snatch’d her favourite from the grave.  
  
Warm thro’ his heart the lifeblood play’d anew    
&emsp;Clasp’d in this wife’s fond arms he rose again    
And tells the source whence all his terrors grew.  
  
With Eve’s impatience fill’d, his words in vain    
&emsp;Would stop her progress, to the globe she flies    
Of danger reckless, nor afraid of pain.    
  
She holds the nail prepared, the shock she tries    
&emsp;Controll’d by fate, her senses bear the blow,    
Yet in his arms o’ercome and faint she lies.    
  
Sooner she cried shall seas forget to flow    
&emsp;Than Science to her smile Cunaeus’ claim    
Thy laurels with each added year shall grow    
  
By thee condensed, the concentrated flame    
&emsp;Of yon machine with tenfold strength has shone    
Oh long shall Leyden dwell upon thy fame    
&emsp;Adopt this great discovery as her own    
And grace thy phial with her awful name.
