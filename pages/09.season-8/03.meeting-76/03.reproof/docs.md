##### The Poet to his Love

Hush! Hush! ye winds, ye zephyr sleep  
Let nought disturb his soft repose.  

The Graces, Helicon, the tuneful Nine  
Swift to the poet’s fancy rose  
The chorus raised their voice and sung.  
The poet’s heart was rapture fired  
And every cadence pierced his soul  
And every strain new joy inspired  
They sung of virtue, love, and truth,  
In rev’rend age, in blooming youth  
Sweet was the song, yet at the close,  
The poet’s heart was filled with woes;  
And thus is was   
We’ve given the sceptre  
And the laurel crown  
To *thee* Ingrate!  
Who sings of other love  
But not thine own;  
The just reproof the poet stung  
The glittering tear stood in his eye  
He seized his harp which lay unstrung  
He blushed, and breathed a heart-felt sigh,  
He tuned his lays to higher themes  
Than those he sang before,  
He sings his love! and virtues fair  
Which dwell in Jove’s high bower  
“Irene good, Irene dear!  
To me in bounty given  
To soften care, to sweeten life,  
The gift of favoring heaven.  
Fair justice rules thy mind,  
Great Pallas lights thy soul,  
Thy heart still feels for others woes,  
By pity’s soft control.  
Dear other-self, my earthly good  
To me in bounty given  
To soften care, to sweeten life,  
The gift of favoring heaven.”

Well hast thou sung, the Muses cried,  
Thy theme so good, thy words so true  
Tomorrow string thy harp afresh,  
we’ll hear thy faithful strain anew.
