Come listen to a tale of old,  
Of love, and truth, and magic spell  
Such as, in wildest number told,  
Oft charm’d Norweya’s warriors bold  
To act the deeds they lov’d in song so well.

Fair smiled Biorno’s youthful morn,  
A gallant Prince was he;  
Of Hringo, King of Upland, born,  
A monarch brave and free.

None to Biorno could compare  
For courage, sense and truth;  
For eagle eye and raven hair  
For manly form and beauty rare;  
And every grace of youth.  

No royal maid the North that graced  
To win his love but sigh’d;  
No damsel noble, fair and chaste,  
Of Upland, but in joyful haste  
The glorious proffer had unbraced  
To shine Biorno’s bride.  

But royal charms or noble art  
Alike he held in scorn,  
For, from sweet childhood’s days, his heart  
Love’s gentle chain had worn.  

Round Bera’s heart love’s gentle chain  
In equal measure twined,  
And never was a worthier twain  
By that sweet knot conjoined!  

Old Gothmund was her humble sire  
A warrior stout and bold,  
Biorno o’er his wintry fire  
No tale of days gone by could tire;  
But Bera’s flood ran cold.  

When came the martial time of spring  
And o’er the seas should roam  
Her country’s heroes, prince and king  
Thro’ strife and danger bound to bring  
Renown and booty home.

The ships are mann’d, the banners fly,  
Bold Hringo courts the breeze;  
But see, the Queen with tearful eye  
Beseech him not to lead his boy  
Out o’er the dangerous seas.  

And why should she her safety prize  
When not his mother she,  
But one who, versed in fraud and lies,  
Late charmed the King’s misjudging eyes,  
A skilful Witch-Ladye.

The Prince remain’d, the sails were spread,  
And then the Queen began  
To tempt Biorno to her bed —   
“Sweet youth, be my leman!”  

“Avoid! false Queen! away for shame!  
Is this thy plighted troth?  
I hate and scorn thy impious flame!”  
How sudden then the weird step-dance  
Changed love to deadly wrath!  

“Hence,” she exclaimed, “while yet alive  
Hence to the lonely wood!  
There on thy father’s herds to thrive,  
There be it still thy fate to live  
Pursuing, die pursued.”  

With this the sorceress raised her hand  
A wolfskin glove it bore  
No mortal can that blow withstand,  
And henceforth none in all the land  
Prince Biorno e’er saw more.  

But soon a black and shaggy bear,  
Of monstrous strength and size,  
Rush’d nightly from his forest lair  
And of the flocks the choicest tore  
E’en in the herdsmen’s eyes.  

“Alas,” they cry, “Biorno wight  
Was foremost in the chase!  
He best could urge the arrows flight  
What spear like his, what sword so bright  
Who fleeter in the race;  
What arm like his in equal might  
This furious bear can face?

Whose eyes are those of softest blue  
That mournful fix on earth?  
Whose cheek is that of pallid hue,  
That smiled, e’er steeped in sorrow’s dew,  
The rosy haunt of mirth?  

Whose golden locks dishevelled fly?  
Whose bosom heaves with many a sigh?  
Who wildly roams the groves  
’Tis Bera mourns with haggard eye  
The loss of him she loves.  

Beneath a willow’s mournful shade  
Her weary length she threw;  
There as her sad lament she made  
And sometimes wept and sometimes pray’d  
What wonder met her view!  

The bear, the terror of the land  
In shaggy pomp appeared —   
She nor can flee, nor can withstand  
Those dreadful paws upreared.  

But see! the savage crouches low  
And fawns upon her feet!  
By youth and expressive show  
He gives the astonished maid to know  
’Tis joy e’en thus to meet.

No more her limbs with terror shook;  
She gazed upon his face  
And seem’d in every wondrous look  
Some well-known glance to trace.  

And soon a wild and frantic cry  
Burst from her trembling tongue  
“What volumes in those glances lie!  
’Tis his, my own Biorno’s eye!  
But ah, this dreadful semblance why?  
What fiend has done this wrong?”

Tears such as tender lovers shed  
And looks of woe he gave;  
Then on the dauntless damsel led  
To where he made his mossy bed  
Within a secret cave.  

There for short space the potent spell  
His human form restored,  
There speech was his the maid to tell  
The doings of his step-dame fell,  
And much the maid deplored.  

Oh wond’rous pow’r of youthful love!  
Here will that maiden stay  
Biorno’s only joy she’ll prove,  
She’ll be his wife, tho’ he must rove  
A bear each fated day.

Thus she who shone in hall and bow’r  
In savage den would live;  
Ah who in this degenerate hour  
Believes that sweet affection’s pow’r  
Such constancy can give!  

So time roll’d on, and summer passed;  
Biorno call’d his wife,  
“My best belov’d, I know at last  
The thread is spun, the shuttle’s cast,  
That ends my web of life.

“Soon shall my flesh the banquet grace  
Of Hringo and his court,  
Soon shall the last of my sad days  
Afford my step-dame sport.  

“But thou, my Bera, ah beware!  
Remember our sad love!  
The fiend-like Queen shall bend her care  
To make thee eat, but may that snare,  
Her last successless prove!”  

Now would he take a last farewell  
Of her, and that drear home;  
But, powerless ’gainst the wicked spell,  
Once more he roars a savage fell,  
And o’er the woods must roam.  

What sounds disturb the lone greenwood  
With clam’rous shout and bay?  

’Tis Hringo, from the field of blood  
Victorious come, in jocund mood  
With hound and horn and hunter good  
The fell black bear to slay.  

The generous bear to fly disdains,  
But many a hound he tore  
And, ere he yielded, dyed the plains  
With many a hunter’s gore.  
Wearied at length, and faint with wounds  
He sought at Hringo’s feet  
Protection from assailing hounds,  
And what he might not ask in sounds  
He begg’d in gestures sweet.  

But duller were paternal eyes  
Than those of love so clear,  
Cowering in vain the suppliant lies  
And gallant good Biorno dies  
E’en by his father’s spear.  

The weeping Bera, who beheld  
From far the dreadful fight  
Is now to meet with fear compell’d  
The royal sorceress’ sight.  

“Bring hither, bring hither, my faithful page  
A mess of royal meat!”  
Oh then how rose the weird-queen’s rage  
When the damsel would not eat!

One piece of flesh she had refused,  
Another touched her tongue,  
The third, such force the weird-queen used,  
She swallowed down, and thus abused  
Was from the palace flung.

Then Bera sought her father’s home  
All sad and mournfully;  
And when her day of pain was come  
Three various sons bore she.  

One rough and cruel, prone to blood  
And savage in his form  
Betray’d the bear in ev’ry mood,  
And dwelt a robber in the wood  
The trav’ler’s dread and harm.  

The next with foot of dog deform’d,  
All else well-shaped and tall,  
Was fair in mind and body form’d  
And men him Houndsfoot call.  

But Bodvar all his sires surpassed  
In every princely grace,  
Consoled his mother for the past,  
Destroyed that wicked Queen at last,  
And o’er the North a glory cast,  
The champion of his race.
