The real occurrence which occasioned the following little jeu d’esprit (which is offered with some diffidence for the Attic Chest) was the escape of its hero, who was usually kept tied for the service of some young ladies, near their cottage, and who was brought home as will be seen in the sequel.

<span class="title">On a late Remarkable Event</span>

From shafts and collar, bit and rein,  
Poor Dapple had escaped again;  
But still for his capacious mind  
The halter’s range is too confin’d;  
At large he meditates to be  
For donkeys e’en love liberty.  
Swift down the lane he takes his way,  
Nor stops for one short parting bray;  
The thistle now appears more sweet  
Than oats or vetches, dainty meat!
