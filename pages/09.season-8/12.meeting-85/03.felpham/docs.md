1

Young Freemen! who learn to obey and command,  
While Providence favours our brave native land;  
While to Britain this guardian new honour imparts,  
Let our country’s just praise be the joy of our hearts!

2

Britannia’s achievements resound o’er the globe,  
Since Waterloo saw her in victory’s robe;  
*Since the waster of earth to a rock she confined*  
And, by caging a vulture, gave rest to mankind.

3

Her sons, all enjoying her glory in arms,  
See peace, with mild radiance, endearing her charms,  
While her young royal fair, now in Hymen’s gay scene,  
From a hero’s pure love learns the task of a queen.

4

Kind Princess! for whom, in a union most rare,  
Affection, and grandeur, new blessings prepare,  
We feel, in recording the joys of thy lot,  
Thy favour enlivened this maritime spot.  

5

Here for thee to the sky our devotions ascend:  
Royal Charlotte! be ever the villager’s friend!  
An example thyself, that no time shall efface,  
Of true British honour and conjugal grace.
