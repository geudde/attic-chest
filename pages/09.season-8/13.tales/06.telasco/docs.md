<span class="title">An American Tale</span>

<span class="pencil">Attic Chest Wednesday May 8th 1816</span>

1

O’er plains where Chile’s warlike race  
&emsp;Th’ invading Spaniard’s force withstood,  
And still Aranco bears the trace  
&emsp;Of stern Valdivia’s noble blood,  
The fleet Telasco urged the chase,  
&emsp;He speeds o’er mountain, lake, and wood,  
Swift fly the birds, for well they know  
The terrors of his sounding bow.

2

The blood of brave Caupolican   
&emsp;Flowed freely in his grand-child’s veins  
Less fleet the agile llama ran  
&emsp;O’er mountain crags, or naked plains  
And in the combat, not a man  
&emsp;Of all the tribes, his arm sustains.  
Victorious o’er a thousand foes  
To hunt the youthful chieftain goes.


3

No mother’s baneful cares defaced  
&emsp;The beauty of his ample brows,  
Or marred that form, by Nature graced  
&emsp;With all that healthful toil bestows.  
As o’er the wide uncultured waste  
&emsp;With godlike energy he goes.  
A Grecian bard, as swift he strode,  
Had deemed the youth their archer god.  

4

With poisoned shafts a quiver filled  
&emsp;A bow of stubborn wood he bore,  
A tiger which his arm had killed,  
&emsp;Supplied the only garb he wore.  
A lance of pointed wood he held,  
&emsp;Which many a llama shall deplore,  
And in his slender scrip was seen  
That powder famed, of potent green.  

5

Where pungent salt and pounded maize  
&emsp;With sweet angelica unite,  
Sustained by this, thro’ rugged ways  
&emsp;He roams for many a day and night,  
Nor courage fails, nor strength decays,  
&emsp;Nor calls the craving appetite,  
While with unerring shafts he slays,  
Provision for the wintry days.

6

The lofty peak of Tencapel  
&emsp;In burning pride before him rose  
And far behind in bolder swell  
&emsp;Flamed Chillan mid a waste of snows.  
O’er rugged steep, thro’ woody dell  
&emsp;With foot untired Telasco goes.  
He starts not from impending ice,  
He skirts the desperate precipice.

7

In vain the mild alpaca flies,  
&emsp;His darts the llama’s speed attain  
By him th’ unwieldy tapir dies,  
&emsp;The birds ascend the skies in vain.  
From rock to rock the hunter hies,  
&emsp;He springs thro’ thicket, grove and plain,  
The tiger marked his rapid way,  
And dared not rush upon his prey.

8

Now plunging in primeval shades  
&emsp;That scarce admit the light of day  
Thro’ tangling brakes and trackless glades  
&emsp;Telasco forced his desperate way.  
More thick the verdant umbrage spreads  
&emsp;While dangled from each graceful spray,  
The clematis of rich perfume,  
The purple cogul’s scentless bloom.

9

In lilac pride or fragrant white  
&emsp;The rich magnolia blossomed there  
And flowers that scent the silent night,  
&emsp;And pale syringas sweet as pair,  
And trees that in the pallid light,  
&emsp;As clothed with silvery scales appear.  
And there the vermil kalmia vies  
With the loved rose of Eastern skies.

10

But whence that cry, so loud and near,  
&emsp;That echoes thro’ the quivering shade?  
A wandering nation visit there  
&emsp;The turf that hides the mighty dead  
And by their honoured bones they swear  
&emsp;To feed the hate their fathers fed  
While vengeance mingles with the wail  
Of filial grief that loads the gale.

11

And well their chief Telasco knows,  
&emsp;The crimson feathers of his crest  
The fiery eye and flattened brows  
&emsp;His deadliest enemy attest.  
Another day, the furious foes  
&emsp;His unprotected tribe molest,  
While heedless he pursues the chase,  
Destruction hovers o’er his race.

12

But who is she whose sable hair  
&emsp;A curious wreath of shells entwines?  
While her short vest of feathers rare  
&emsp;A band of glittering beads confines.  
A ring of gold in either ear  
&emsp;On either polished ankle shines,  
Her lively smile, her graceful mien,  
Seemed brighter in so rude a scene.

13

But hark! thro’ all the startled air  
&emsp;Reverberates low a sullen sound,  
The screaming birds attest their fear,  
&emsp;Heaves like the waves the quaking ground.  
And thro’ the darkened atmosphere,  
&emsp;The scorching cinders fall around  
Hark! distant Cotiapo roars  
His vast eruptions shake the shores.

14

The opening ground a rent displayed,  
&emsp;Dense fumes and noxious vapours rise,  
And on its brink the trembling maid  
&emsp;Stands while her heedless father flies.  
And all his tribe refuse their aid  
&emsp;Regardless of her piercing cries.  
Her dangerous state Telasco viewed,  
He bore her to the sheltering wood.

15

But woods afford no friendly shade,  
&emsp;She branches wave, the trunks are riven,  
Swift from the falling groves they fled  
&emsp;They seek again the open heaven —   
The shocks have ceased, the skies are red  
&emsp;Red with the tranquil light of even  
But that broad flame in middle air  
Is that the dread volcano’s glare.

16

“No,” cried the maid, “in that bright blaze  
&emsp;Telasco’s hated race expires  
My father’s tribe, by secret ways  
&emsp;Approach to spread the fatal fires.  
Perchance amid those sanguine rays  
&emsp;The savage chieftain’s soul aspires.  
Then farewell sorrow, doubt alarm,  
My sire need fear no meaner arm.”

17

Telasco’s hand the hatchet raised —   
&emsp;It sunk inactive by his side;  
His eyes with sudden fury blazed —   
&emsp;In pity’s dew the flashes died.  
While on the gentle maid he gazed,  
&emsp;Grief, anger and and revenge subside?  
In her he less had liked to trace  
A heart and alien to her race.

18

“Farewell!” he cried, “my duty calls,  
&emsp;The combat I must seek to share,  
Due westward and lie thy native walls,  
&emsp;Its issue wait in safety there.  
Secure whate’er thy sire befalls  
&emsp;Telasco’s arm he need not fear.  
By his if thy preserver die,  
Give to his fate one passing sigh.”

19

Fleet as the archer’s winged reeds  
&emsp;Yet silent as the dews of night.  
Low crouched amid the tangled weeds  
&emsp;Telasco still pursues the light.  
Swift as the gliding snake he speeds,  
&emsp;His blazing huts are full in sight,  
While standing on their comrades slain,  
His men a fruitless fight maintain.

20

Concealed behind a spreading tree,  
&emsp;With fatal aim his javelin flew,  
While sent by hands they cannot see  
&emsp;His shafts the foremost foemen slew.  
&emsp;Some with sudden panic flee  
Telasco’s rallying friends pursue,  
While to avenge their comrades’ blood  
The holder few surround the wood.

21

Now hence now there Telasco goes,  
&emsp;At every turn he makes his stand,  
And darts as from a thousand bows.  
&emsp;Fall thick upon the shrinking band,  
Again their lives the wood enclose,  
&emsp;Their Cacique seized a lighted brand.  
He fires the wood, the crackling blaze,  
Shoots to the skies its sanguine rays.

22

Now fall primeval groves, and wide  
&emsp;The devastating fury spread,  
Trees that in patriarchal pride  
&emsp;Waned o’er their great forefathers dead,  
And tender saplings by their side  
&emsp;Gleam one sad mass of dusky red.  
They totter, lo! the crashing sound  
The fiery hail that rises round.  


23

Affrighted by the sultry glare  
&emsp;On high the screaming birds arose  
The tiger started from his lair,  
&emsp;And howling sprung upon his foes,  
From slumber roused the unwieldy bear.  
&emsp;Swift o’er the blazing branches goes,  
And followed by the angry boar  
The nearest of the assailants tore.

24

Still fought Telasco unsubdued,  
&emsp;His arrows kindle as they fly,  
And branches from the blazing wood  
&emsp;His quiver’s failing store supply.  
And now against a pine he stood  
&emsp;Whose shady honours flamed on high.  
His sinewy arms its trunk enclose.  
It falls, it whelms an hundred foes.

25

With it the brave Telasco fell  
&emsp;But rose, his hatchet in his hand,  
And leaping forth, with hideous yell  
&emsp;He slays the boldest of the band.  
His force not all their ranks repel.  
&emsp;They fly, or strew the blazing sand.  
Their chief alone to combat runs,  
Their chief alone Telasco shuns.

26

For well Oneyda’s sire, he knows,  
&emsp;Whose cherish’d life he vowed to shame  
But while he falls on meaner foes  
&emsp;The Cacique’s hatchet rose in air.  
Deep in his naked side it goes.  
&emsp;He fell, and life had ended there,  
But vengeance, still unsated saves,  
For keener woes the life she craves.

27

Far from the burning scene of strife  
&emsp;They give him to Oneyda’s care,  
Oh! could he spurn the draught of life  
&emsp;From heart so kind or hands so fair  
Tho’ for the hour with tortures rife,  
&emsp;Those cares his wasted strength repair.  
Or could she see his sunken eye,  
And sternly kind those cares deny.

28

Telasco cannot hope for grace  
&emsp;Nor could his spirit brook to be  
Adopted offspring of a race  
&emsp;His arm so oft hat taught to flee,  
Nor shall his end a chief disgrace  
&emsp;No sign of pain his foes shall see,  
In death alone he hopes to prove  
He might deserve Oneyda’s love.

29

Yet fancy sometimes pictures scenes  
&emsp;The fairer, that he knows them vain.  
A gleam of rapture intervenes  
&emsp;E’en in his darkest hours of pain  
Now on his arm Oneyda leans,  
&emsp;For her he seeks the juicy cane.  
Or lists to the bird that tells,  
Where bees conceal their honied cells.

30

And now for her with pointed spear  
&emsp;He wounds the ocean’s finny race,  
Or bounding high, in full career  
&emsp;Outstrips the llama in the chase.  
Or while she sings, assists to rear  
&emsp;Their field of manioc or of maize  
to her the mocking bird replies —   
Alas, the golden vision flies.

31

But time rolls on: the hour is nigh,  
&emsp;Fixed for Telasco’s sacrifice,  
Each warrior comes to feast his eye  
&emsp;With the lost hero’s agonies.  
Oh, say, does less of mercy lie  
&emsp;In those by whom a prisoner dies;  
Who tear his senseless flesh, or those,  
Who banquet on his living woes.

32  

Yet once Oneyda strove to wake  
&emsp;Some pity in her stubborn sire,  
No tears the fires of vengeance slake  
&emsp;On her she draws his fiercest ire,  
“Thou alien, pleadst thou for his sake,  
&emsp;Then thou shalt light the fatal pyre,  
And learn like me to glut thine eyes  
While he in lingering torments dies.”

33

The hour is come, the victim placed,  
&emsp;The gathering crowds each moment swell,  
And thrice her torch Oneyda raised  
&emsp;Thrice nerveless at her side it fell.  
At once her eye more brightly blazed  
&emsp;Her glowing cheeks new courage tell  
Telasco with unshrinking frame  
Beholds her light the fatal flame.

34

But yestermorn those youthful trees  
&emsp;Spread their green branches to the day  
Yet now they blaze and vengeance sees  
&emsp;Half his rich harvest torn away  
Oneyda from th’ industrious bees  
&emsp;Had stolen their waxen cells away  
Haste wretches, glut your savage ire  
Soon will your helpless prey expire.

35

But pause we here, the Muse delights  
&emsp;In scenes of horror less o’erbearing  
When for his country’s weal he fights  
&emsp;She loves the hero’s matchless daring  
She follows to his funeral rites  
&emsp;Where grief with patriot pride is sharing  
But sickening turns her heavenly eye  
From brutal coward cruelty

36

Yet still the victims limbs sustain  
&emsp;Exhausted hatred’s fiercest store,  
“Fool, fools,” Oneyda cried, “’tis vain  
&emsp;Desist! your senseless arts give o’er.  
Tho’ keen your instruments of pain  
&emsp;This simple dart shall touch him more.”  
She spoke, she plunged it in her side  
Gazed on his altered face and died.

37

Oh! then Telasco’s shriek of woe  
&emsp;Was mingled with her father’s cry  
His cheeks a deadlier paleness show  
&emsp;His hands are clenched in agony.  
Then as the fires more keenly glow  
&emsp;To end his hour of misery,  
He smiles to see his wasting frame  
He sinks amid the hottest flame.
