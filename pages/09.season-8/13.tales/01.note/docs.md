Fascicle No. 36 of the Attic Chest materials is numbered 86 on the cover, and filed between Meetings 85 and 87. It bears no date and contains no contributions from Meeting 86. Entitled ‘Tales’, it is a compilation of longer poems by an author identifying himself as Sadi. 

Annotations in what appears to be William Porden’s hand identify the earlier meetings at which each of the Tales was read. To avoid confusion, these longer poems are reproduced as they have been filed in the Gell Collection, with internal links from the respective meetings.
