<span class="title">An Arabian Tale</span>

<span class="pencil">Attic Chest Wednesday March 13th 1816</span>

No! Sadi, No! my frozen ear  
&emsp;Not e’en thy choicest tale could move.  
Of war the vanquish’d must not hear  
The vanquished may not speak of love.  
Cursed Ali’s happier stars prevail —   
Yet haste thee! seek the shelter’d vale,  
My mother with a virgin train,  
&emsp;There waits to wreath my victor head.  
Alas! she weaves the palm in vain,  
&emsp;The palm on Ali’s brow is spread.  
Yet when my bands return again,  
Say, Mahmoud sleeps not with the slain.    
Thro’ favouring darkness lead them here —   
Vengeance and Ali’s camp are near!  
Meanwhile yon palm-grove’s spreading shade,  
Shall hide a vanquish’d chieftain’s head.  
&emsp;Soft o’er his head the branches play’d  
And brightly thro’ the grassy glade  
The silver fountains gurgling creep,  
But humbled pride can never sleep.
Fire burns in Mahmoud’s tortured brain  
He seeks for rest with toil as vain,  
As if in yonder desert bare  
’Mid sands that float in burning air.  
And less of danger there were found —   
Oh! who is she with agile bound  
Who ’mid a train of dark-eyed maids  
Flits lightly thro’ the feathery shades  
Tall as the palm her graceful height,  
Than mountain snows her foot more white  
On her full lip the Syrian rose  
In fragrance breathes, in beauty glows  
Her glossy hair might emulate  
The lustre of the golden date.  
She speaks, the stream that murmuring strays  
With less of silver music plays.  
The gazelle’s eye less darkly bright,  
Less fleet the gazelle in its flight.  
&emsp;Her glance has met the stranger’s eye —   
She flies not, wherefore should she fly?  
The silver moon is scarce so pure,  
She moves in innocence secure.  
And from the fountain’s emerald brink  
Bears the full cup, and bids him drink.  
Those draughts his torturing thirst assuage  
But kindle passion’s fiercer rage.

He wakes in Ali’s ample tent  
The lovely Laila o’er him bent,  
And seems to Mahmoud’s opening eyes  
An houri form of Paradise.  
While Ali’s liberal soul repays,  
The care that saved his daughter’s days,  
But brimming cups from Ali’s hand  
&emsp;Are sour’d by hatred’s keenest stings  
While love the tempting beverage fann’d  
&emsp;Which lovely Laila frequent brings.  
His touch can taint the melon’s juice,  
While hers can magic sweets infuse.  
Now Mahmoud wish’d his bondage pat,  
That he from Ali’s sight may fly  
Now think his wounds are healed too fast  
&emsp;While he may live in Laila’s eye.  
Yet but by stealth he dares to trace  
Her winning smile, her form of grace.  
He dare not gaze upon her eye,  
He dare not trust the softest sigh  
Or call by tender accents down,  
The father’s rage, the daughter’s frown.  
His wounds are closed — from day to day,  
Still Ali’s asks the stranger’s stay  
And Mahmoud’s soul has scarce the power  
To hasten his departing hour.

He gazes on her jet-black eye  
And speaks of love with many a sigh.  
“Art thou of Arab race?” she said,  
“And know’st thou not an Arab maid?  
The Turks they say who dwell in towns  
In walls their countless wives immure,  
Yet scarcely hold their faith secure  
But Arab maids o’er sands and downs  
Range free as air, and Oh! as pure.  
Fond Youth thy senseless love restrain,  
A powerful chieftain’s anger shun  
Not Arab maids are false and vain  
Not Ali’s daughter lightly won.”

“Thou Ali’s child!” he cried — the sound  
In thrilling shrieks of woe was drown’d,  
Sweet Laila’s maidens, sporting there,  
Had roused a lion from its lair,  
On Laila now it furious flies  
On yonder tree her bow is hung  
Across her path the streamlet flung,  
Her damsels pierce the air with cries  
But Mahmoud comes, his powerful hands  
Have stretch’d the savage on the sands  
His arm its dying fury tore  
He faints amid his weltering gore.  

At morn he gazed upon the sun,  
At noon, when half its course was run,  
At eve, when with the setting ray  
His every bliss seemed passed away,  
Yet deeper crimson flushed his cheek,  
When thus he forced his tongue to speak.

“Ali, for kindness past, receive  
Such thanks as grateful Arabs give  
And yield that hand to friendly clasp  
Which soon the hostile steel may grasp.  
’Tis Mahmoud speaks, and Ali knows  
In Mahmoud’s race his worst of foes,  
Yet surely for my grandsire’s guilt  
Enough of blood has Ali spilt.  
No more can Hussun’s spirit claim  
No more an injured chieftain’s fame.  
The deadly blood feud well may cease  
When fiery Mahmoud asks for peace.”

“Talk’st thou of peace! of faith renew’d!  
Can words atone for Hussun’s blood?  
Thy father’s sire my father slew  
Nor can thy fawning words efface  
The stain of blood that taints thy race —   
My daughter’s thanks to thee are due  
And Ali owns, altho’ with thee  
The laws of hospitality,  
Nor will he lift a hand to shed  
His blood who shares his salt and bread.  
But quit this this tent with dawning light,  
A toad would less offend my sight,  
And impious Nazarene accurst,  
Or Shah, of infidels the worst!  
When next we meet upon the plain  
Or thou or I shall swell the slain  
Then may the rankling blood feud cease,  
Let victors only talk of peace.”

“Forbear thy taunts, a happier sky   
May see thy boasting squadrons fly,  
E’en Ali in the hour of need,  
May try and bless his courser’s speed;  
Yet heaven from Laila turn the frown,  
The pride of Ali’s race calls down.”

He ceased — a sudden gleam of light,  
Breaks through the ebon gloom of night,  
Amid the clash of hostile spears  
His well known battle cry he hears,  
And sees an hundred blazing brands,  
Reared in his followers’ faithful hands.
One moment, and in baleful fire  
Ali and Ali’s race expire.  
“Proud man,” they cry, “thy vaunts are brief,  
And flames avenge our murder’d chief.  
We found his steed in yonder wood,  
The fountain’s brink was stained with blood — ”

“Pause, kinsmen, pause, your chief is here —   
Now Ali, know my words sincere,  
By fraud unstained, unswayed by fear  
If I but speak the flame ascends.  
On Mahmoud Ali’s fate depends,  
Victors thou say’st may speak of peace,  
Then now I bid the blood-feud cease!  
Yet think not I would have thee buy  
Thy remnant days with infamy  
How worthless then the gift of life.  
No! nobly close our lengthened strife,  
On death has Ali often smiled  
Nor death appals a soldier’s child,  
Yet — save her from destroying flames  
And yield her — yield to tenderer claims.”

“Mahmoud, a true with needless art,  
Think’st thou I cannot read thy heart.
Thy speech was never meant fo rm  
Not sorrow for thy grandsire’s guilt,  
For all the blood in contest spilt,  
But Laila’s charms have waked in thee,  
This cant of generosity.  
But he Great Prophet in this hour  
Give to they words unearthly power.  
I feel my rankling hate expire  
Like those decaying brands of fire  
Let Laila speak — if she approve  
I frown not on her grateful love.”

She came, a blush was on her cheeks,  
Humble she knelt upon the sands  
And meekly kissed her father’s hands,  
Then thus in faltering accents speaks.  
“An honour’d mother to supply  
A father’s looks of love to view,  
With him to live, with him to die  
Were all that Laila’s wishes knew  
And if such doom her parent gives,  
With him his daughter dies or lives.  
Yet if he stanch the deadly feud,  
If she may own her gratitude
If such indeed the wondrous power  
To Laila given in this blest hour,  
Then let the horrid discourse cease  
And Laila’s hand confirm the peace.  
With blood has Hussun’s tomb been laved,  
&emsp;Can injured honour more require?  
Then be a daughter’s being saved  
&emsp;Atonement for a slaughter’s sire.”

She paus’d, the rugged warrior smiled,  
“Here! Mahmoud, take this duteous child!  
I need not say our contents close  
For well an Arab chieftain knows  
How we, who own nor house nor land,  
Pause ere we yield a daughter’s hand.  
Our swords, our offspring, all our pride  
We have, we ask not aught beside.  
Save the cool breeze, the sunny beam,  
The golden date, the murmuring stream.”

The ring on Laila’s finger shines,  
And either tribe its hate resigns.  
Two days have hastened to a close,  
The spousal’s latest morn arose.
The first, in robes of state  
In maiden beauty Laila sate,  
While Ali’s numerous kinsmen vied  
In presents to the lovely bride.  
The next the henna’s matron dye  
In fragrance bathes her blushing hands  
Her feet that erst with snow might vie  
Gleam purple on the yellow sands.  
The third, with Ali’s warrior train,  
She moves in triumph o’er the plain.  
No other maid in Yemen’s land  
&emsp;Might dare that fiery steed to ride,  
But gentle Laila’s skilful hand  
&emsp;Curbs with a touch his foaming pride.

&emsp;And Mahmoud comes, on prancing steeds  
The chief his armed kinsmen leads  
&emsp;The orange at the bride is thrown,  
He turns and o’er the desert flies  
While all pursue with shouts and cries,  
&emsp;Whoe’er shall draw the bridegroom down  
His steed and robes remain their prize  
That steed of all his steeds the best  
That Syrian blade, that jewelled vest.

At Mahmoud’s tent her winding course  
Now Laila stops — his kinsmen bear  
Their presents to the blushing fair.  
With grace she quits the prancing horse,  
In vain her maidens round her kneel’d  
To win her stay with streaming tears,  
And Mahmoud’s kinsmen bid her yield,  
Her promised dowry to their prayers.

She enters, and with mirthful din  
A thousand antic sports begin,  
The bridegroom claims despotic power  
And strange behests amuse the hour.  
Some tale with wonders filled to find.  
Or recreant slaves to whip and bind,  
To eat, to sing, to dance, to laugh,  
Perchance forbidden bowls to quaff.  
For little Arab wanderers know  
Of fast or vigil, prayer or vow.

A Kurd of respectability speaking in private to an Englishman said his tribe were more like Europeans that Turks. “We eat hog-flesh, keep no fasts, and say no prayers.” !!!
