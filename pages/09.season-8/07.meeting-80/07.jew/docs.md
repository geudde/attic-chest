The Editor of the Legends of Lampidosa has been anticipated by a Brother Antiquarian in his communications to the Attic Chest. As M. Laboree has sent a Tale which should have been the third in the series promised by the Editor, the 4th and last is now enclosed. The “Saxon” and the “Swede” show some resemblance to the “Englishman” and the “Jew” in shape and feature, but none in language and manners to justify the charge of plagiarism. Moral philosophers of *more* than &emsp; agree that knaves are only *parodies* of honest men.

<span class="title">4&#46; The Jew</span>

Down the Green Dragon’s darkest stair  
Slow comes a lonely lanthorn’s glare  
Bright as a firefly o’er a swamp  
It glides thro’ cellars drear and damp  
’Midst countless casks with iron bound  
And binns with hoary saw-dust crown’d  
Hid in the hollow lap of earth—  
Dark fountains of celestial mirth!  
Now thro’ the vast cylindric throng  
An awful stranger stalks along —   
His sable beard with rev’rend grace  
Floats around the margin of his face,  
Like worsted fringe on yellow chintz,  
While thro’ his shaggy brow he squints  
With red and lurking eye-balls, seeming  
Two glow-worms in a thicket gleaming,  
Before him, with capacious sides,  
The Lord of the Green-Dragon glides!  
His face, by purple Bacchus sign’d,  
Burns like a flame in crystal shrin’d,  
Or like a chymist’s window bright  
With azure and vermilion light.  

First speaks the Jew—“To one alone  
The mighty talisman is known  
Which from a cask without a flaw  
Pure *white*, and racy *red* can draw:  
As thou has sworn to burn thy bill,  
Landlord! for thee I shew my skill —   
For thee alone!—and all I ask  
Is here to view thy eldest cask.”  

“Deep in the hollow of yon cave  
Known to no vile revenue-slave,  
Unwatered stands my oldest pipe  
From rich Oporto—rough and ripe;  
Worthy to make a monarch frisk, sir!  
Or wet immortal Blucher’s whisker;  
The Duke whose deeds astound the Gauls  
For purer nectar never calls —   
And they (the sons of Glory reckon’d)  
The ninety-fifth and forty-second,  
Who drank twelve casks a day of wine  
Had only wanted one of mine.  
Such nectar as my binns supply  
Man, while he *drinks*, can never die!”

He said — with cabalistic hand    
The Jew that holy cask has scann’d:    
Thrice from a phial’s liquid stores  
Ammonia’s potent salt he pours  
And mingles (in a mystic glass hid)  
Sulphurous oil with nitrous acid  
Then spoke triumphant—“All is done  
Well, by the faith of Abraham’s son!  
But that thou may’st thy treasure see  
Two holes must in this hogshead be —   
White sparkling Port from one shall flow  
The other shall pure *red* bestow.  
Here fix thy thumb—with now with care  
Thy left-hand thumb lodge firmly there —   
Wait but an instant while I go    
To bring two goblets down below    
Then may’st thou own how much a Jew  
To serve a Yorkshireman can do.”  

Thro’ the arch’d cellar’s gloom profound  
The Rabbi’s parting footsteps sound —   
While the red minister of wines  
Thus musing, on his cask reclines  
And breathes the anxious thought which brings    
Food to the fancy whence it springs.

“’Tis true by those who patents seek    
	Much money can be lost —     
And coward souls in vain may speak    
	Of what a sum they cost:    
But here is one who vows to make    
Both *red* and *white* Port, for my sake,    
	Dwell in one cask, uncross’d;    
And he is one who would not dare    
To waste the wine that ripens there!  

“Howe’er it prove, all vintners know    
	Art has a pow’r divine;    
To water honest wine may grow    
	And water change to wine:    
Since we who live to make men merry    
Turn white to red, and Port to Sherry    
	By secrets in our line;    
Sure wine may be both red and white    
Like lovely cheeks by candle-light.

“When Ladies frown and love is blind    
	Ladies and Love give trouble    
But when the bottle’s balm they find    
	Both swains and dame see double:    
If then, while bowls are full and bright    
All men enjoy a twofold sight    
	And call old care a bubble,    
Why should not wine have double hue    
And landlord’s bills be double too?”

Still in the cask he rests his thumbs  
He listens, but no Rabbi comes:  
Yet yonder gleams a lamp—it pours  
Red light among his cellar-stores —   
He stiffens with affright—his eyes  
Behold his wife before him rise!  
  
“Robin, awake!—what, always here?  
Always thy eldest hogshead near?  
On taverns rear’d, in cellars nursed  
Nor ale nor wine can quench thy thirst!  
See, numskull, how much Port is spilt!  
Gone are my cups of silver gilt,  
While you sit dozing, deaf and dumb,  
Making a spigot of your thumb!”

There is a sound in Robin’s sigh,  
A wildfire in his flashing eye —   
Dire was her blow—that blow to pay  
He draws his captive thumbs away —   
Forth o’er the ample cellar’s floor  
Streams the rich pipe’s nectareous store —   
“The Jew has cheated me!” he sigh’d —   
Clung to his empty cask, and ***cried!***
