<span class="title">Prize Poem by Artemisia Bustleton</span>

O thou, the winged courser of the Nine,  
Whirl me aloft, on tireless wings upborne!  
And if I snatch from our thy rainbow pinion  
One quill immortal, be it mine to write  
On themes that soar above all vulgar strains —   
That soar indeed! for flight itself I sing.  
Or if the Muses’ winged steed disdain  
To bear the bard that scarce requires their aid,  
Illumin’d by th’ inspiring pow’r of Her  
Who on the winged lightning flies sublime,  
Weeps in the dew, and sighs in ev’ry gale;  
Thee, purest spirit of aërial race,  
Who, throned above our vulgar atmosphere  
Play’st in the solar beam, thee I invoke,  
Oh Hydrogen! thou surest, best ally,  
To waft us through the pathless element!

When was the period that aspiring Man  
Sought not to find some transport to the skies?  
When gentle sleep in pleasing torpor lulls  
Our grosser corporal frames, our soaring spirits,  
In fancied flights delighting, love to bask  
In the bright regions of etherial day:  
And, mid Munchausen’s wondrous voyages,  
Not tales of loaves, or ready-roasted beef,  
Or skins of wine, that hang on every tree;  
Or men whose heads, disjointed from their shoulders,  
Serve them for balls; or stags with cherry-trees  
Upspringing from their haunches, so delight  
Th’ enraptured mind, as when he sings of men  
And lovely virgins, that in liquid air  
Weave the light dance with forms of sylphid grace  
Thus prone to soar is buoyant fancy ever,  
And oft have active hands essayed the means  
To realize the hope of active minds.  
The antient poets sing Daedalian art,  
And elder Bacon turned his mighty mind  
And fertile pen to treat of flying lore;  
But ere a greater Bacon rose to scan  
Fair science’ boundaries, and fix her laws,  
No shame was formed that safely promised flight,  
Twere long to tell, since wise Borelli taught  
No human arm had muscles fit for wings,  
What crotchets filled each philosophic brain.  
Tho’ Wilkins inly deemed a globe of fire,  
Or air etherial, self-sustained would rise,  
Buoyed by its own inherent levity,  
As floats an empty vessel on the wave;  
On springs and mechanism his hopes of flight  
The high-aspiring prelate vainly rests.  
Of air exhausted, Lana’s metal sphere,  
Collapsed by atmospheric pressure, falls.  
Friar Gusman’s bird-like kite, with tubes and sails,  
Magnetic spheres, amber, and bellows driven,  
Excites but mirth in these enlightened days;  
Tho Lusitania’s monarch placed the sage  
In cloister’d ease beneath Santarem’s shade,  
And when his wicker basket paper’d o’er  
Soar’s up two hundred feet in ambient air,  
The crowd by magic deemed the wonder wrought.

But when, O Cavendish! thy deep research,  
And thine, O Black! of air inflammable  
Had proved the levity, and Cavallo tried  
To raise a bladder and a paper sphere,  
Who but had thought the grand arcanum found,  
Till ends his guest in blowing soapy bubbles?  
’Tis thus with Man — his wit and wisdom spent  
To gain th’ applause of a deceitful world,  
He finds too late ’tis but a bubble all.

Yet could not soaring science thus be foiled,  
Where from Lutetia’s thickly-clustring hearths  
The wreathing smoke aspired, two Brethren sage  
(Reckless how splashing mud assailed their hose,  
Or cars life-threatening rolled their ceaseless din)  
Mark’d its light curls, and deem’d th’ expansive pow’r  
That thus propell’d it, might the means afford  
To raise in middle air a swelling globe.  
Hail, glorious thought! Montgolfier, honor’d name,  
For this shall live in song while song shall live  
The great inventor of the famed BALLOON!

First, as the eaglet tries his tender wing,  
Small spheres, inflated by a pendent flame,  
Rose quiv’ring in mid air to point the way.  
Then at Versailles (ere dire rebellion’s pow’r  
Despoiled fair France of nobles, King, and Queen)  
The Court beheld with joy a wondrous sight.  
First of aërial voyagers went forth,  
Oh favor’d Three! a Sheep, a Cock, a Duck,  
Who, when the bleat and quack and crow of triumph  
Mingled with royal plaudits, noble “bravo!”s,  
And joyous general shouts that rent the air,  
Who but, with generous emulation smit,  
Had wished himself that sheep, that cock, or duck?  
E’en thus, when first immortal Priestley found  
His retorts filled with empyrean air,  
First of created things a favored mouse  
He chose to breathe it, he beheld her quaff  
The draught delighted, and delighted dance  
Inspired with new-born life — Oh! who but envies  
That happy mouse, the happiest of her kind!  
Thus on immortal frogs Galvani proved  
His new-found pow’r; and hecatombs of rabbits  
By Spallanzani’s poisons glorious died!

Not long may sheep, frogs, mice, or poultry move  
Philosophers to envy; Paris saw  
Pilatre de Rosier, advent’rous sage!  
Hover o’er all her domes, his gay balloon  
Just held to earth by one slight trembling cord.

Bold was the man who first tried unknown seas  
Beyond the sight of land; but bolder far  
The man who, by a fragile sphere upborne,  
The treacherous elements (like fabled fiends  
That guide their motions) prove, as proverbs say,  
Good servants but bad masters. Had they not  
With rapid hand applied the moistened sponge  
Fire had cut short their voyage, fame, and life.  
Oh early warned, beware! de Rosier learn  
To trust no more the dangerous ally!  
In vain he’s warned! again he mounts the car,  
A new machine with Romaine’s help he tries,  
And science mourns her martyrs. Love too weeps  
For not her lonely lamp Pilatre’s breast  
Illumin’d wholly; other flames aspired
