Say not, my Celia, that I’m prone  
To rove from Fair to Fair;  
My heart once giv’n to thee alone  
Thou ever reignest there.

When love sincere upon the soul  
Had fix’d its genuine seal;  
It aye preserves its soft control;  
And such the love I feel.  

Then, say not that to other Fair  
My eye to often strays;  
I only see thy beauties there,  
When on their charms I gaze.  

And quick comparison I trace  
’Tween thee my Fair, and them;  
And many a lovely form and face  
On scrutiny condemn.

Those jet black eyes may fire the youth  
Who Celia never knew  
But want the tenderness and truth  
That beam from hers of blue.  

I grant the lily and the rose  
Bloom beauteous in that face,  
But in my Celia’s aspect glows  
Expression’s lovelier grace.

That mouth is small, those teeth are white,  
But where’s the silver tongue  
That, when they pall upon the sight,  
Can ecstasy prolong?  

Tho form’s best grace, and motion’s skill  
In many, charm combin’d  
They’re but as lovely statues still  
Without my Celia’s mind.

Yes, Celia yes, ’tis thee alone  
I ever lov’d and love;  
The earliest Queen my heart would own,  
The last it e’er shall prove.

Hippolytus
