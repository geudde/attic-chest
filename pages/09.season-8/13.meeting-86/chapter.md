Fascicle No. 36 of the Attic Chest materials is numbered 86 on the cover, and filed between Meetings 85 and 87. It does not, however, contain any contributions from Meeting 86. Instead, it is titled ‘Tales’ and consists of a compilation of longer poems by an author identifying himself as Sadi. 

Annotations in what appears to be William Porden’s hand identify the meetings at which each of the Tales was read. To avoid confusion, these longer poems are reproduced as they appear in the Gell Collection, with additional links from the respective meetings.
