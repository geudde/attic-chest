> Gormo, Private Secretary to the King of the Blue Mountain!  
> to Stella, Maid of the Sounding Song

Twelve moons have passed since first our Royal Gnome  
Heard thy sweet verse beneath proud Cairn Gorm’s dome.  
The feast was spread, the Chieftains thronged the board  
Returned from conquest o’er Ben Lomond’s board;  
Elate, they told the glory of the day  
To brother Chiefs who had not shared the fray,  
The banquet cheer’d, the goblets pass’d so free,  
The crystal halls resound with revelry.  
At length a pause, when lo! the warlike throng  
Heard the soft warbling of a distant song!  
Starting, tho pleased, at the unwonted sound  
They sought the cause in many a cave profound  
Through many a rocky arch and passage rude  
The voice they followed and their search pursued.  
Ascending still toward the upper earth,  
They see a creature of aerial birth,  
Deep in a grotto of fantastic form  
The unconscious tenant of the great Cairn Gorm!  
A minstrel sylph who left the flowery plain  
And wandered thoughtless to our dark domain,  
Careless he sat, in youthful fancy free  
Wooing the echoes with his minstrelsy.  
Straight to the Mountain King they bear their prize  
Far from enamelled meads and azure skies,  
The monarch smiled upon the captive boy  
And soon in music found a new-born joy
