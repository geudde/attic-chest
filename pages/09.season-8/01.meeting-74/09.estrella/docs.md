##### A Poem

On fam’d Vittoria’s proud but fatal plain  
Estrella roam’s, the fairest maid of Spain.  
The sun, declining in the western sky,  
Fixt for a moment’s space her eager eye.  
Oh! what reflections did that pause contain!  
What varied horrors shot athwart her brain,  
Ere o’er the dreary field she rang’d again.  
&emsp;That beam was lingering on the mountain side  
When Carlos hastened from his trembling bride;  
Oft had he left her, and that fatal word,  
“Farewell,” tho’ sad she oft had calmly heard;  
But *then*, tho’ still his tearless eye was bright,  
And not a word betray’d the coming fight,  
There was unwonted sadness in his air,  
She knew not why — her bosom sunk with fear,  
And while he grasp’d her trembling hand, and pressed  
Her pallid lip, and strain’d her to his breast,  
And earnestness she ne’er had mark’d before  
Appear’d to whisper, “We may meet no more.”  
In vain she strove her wonted calm to find,  
His last, last look was rooted on her mind;  
When, as he held his restless courser’s rein,  
Sudden her turn’d him round, and gaz’d again,  
And fix’d upon her face an earnest look,  
That thrill’d her sould, and more than volumes spoke.  
She strove to speak — his heart her meaning knew,  
And durst not risk another sad adieu;  
He wav’d his hand, and soon with loosen’d rein,  
His steed impatient bore him o’er the plain.  
Yet still she watched him, till the waning light,  
And distance, hid him from her eager sight;  
And still unmoved she linger’d on the spot,  
The night grew dark and cold — she mark’d it not —   
Oh! still she felt his grasp, his form was there,  
And his last words yet vibrate on her ear.  

At length the moon in silver lustre throws  
Her softer colouring o’er the mourner’s woes.  
By slow degrees her magic beams impart  
Their clam and pensive sadness to her heart,  
And down her cheek each sparkling tear that stole  
Appeared to win some sorrows from her soul.  
And now once more the landscape meets her sigh,  
Half sunk in shade, and half in glory bright,  
Yon mountains that the far horizon bound,  
And yon dark woods that stretch their ample round.  
Here native beauty grac’d the lovely land,  
And there it show’d the cruel spoiler’s hand.  
In yon far convent, once the favoured dome  
Of sacred peace, the raven builds his home.  
Lone are its court; the bell is silent there  
That calle’d the simple sisterhood to prayer  
And wak’d to piety the careless ear.  
But war had spar’d that pensive willow grove  
Where oft with Carlos she was wont to rove,  
What time pale Cynthia’s pure and placid beam  
Shone on the windings of Zadora’s stream.  
While still, as now, the magic of the scene  
Shed o’er their thoughtful hearts its calm serene.  
There oft, responsive to her tender lute,  
She sang, till Philomel herself was mute  
While Carlos’ breath inspir’d the mellow flute.  
That lute was near; she seized it, and her hand,  
Unconscious half, its strings attun’d and spann’d.  
Once where Valencia holds her ancient reign,  
And Guadalaviar mingles with the main  
Where, rich with flow’rs and many a fruitful treee,  
Her father’s gardens sloped towards the sea.  
At eve she oft within her jasmine bower,  
That bears her name reflected in its flower,  
Would sing so sweetly that the rowers near  
Have often paus’d upon their oars to hear;
