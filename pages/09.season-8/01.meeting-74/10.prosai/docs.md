Mr Editor!

There are traitors in Positive House! My chronicles shall not be dumb of it!  
Our Sixth Brother’s Tale has been filch’d, and we could not guess  
&emsp;&emsp;What had become of it,  
Till we heard it was read in your court when all the Nine Muses were round ye,  
As a “Lesson for Lovers” in verse subscrib’d by — Sir Pertinax Townly!  
Now, sir, a man’s dying in love or in wine is a tale fit for travellers —  
Brother Bibo fell only *asleep* and will swear he’s alive to all cavillers  
Who stole the best half of his rhymes let Pertinax Townly make clear, as  
We guess they were bought and retail’d by his Muse’s stock-broker,  
&emsp;&emsp;Scriblerass —  
Let him deal him in no more stolen goods, for an action *qui tam* is begun to-day  
And our Seventh Brother’s Tale shall be sent, tho’ he lurks, we know where, like a run-away!
