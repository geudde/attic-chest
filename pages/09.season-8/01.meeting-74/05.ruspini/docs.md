Mr Editor

As the Attic Society encourage *all the Arts*, I cannot resist the temptation to send you the inclosed specimen of more than one of them.

The first stanza of the Illustration is an imitation of a well known poem on the subject of George Barnwell, the rest appear quite original.  

Yours &c. &c. &c.

![Ruspini](ruspini.png?resize=500)

Esculapius sat at his shop door,  
&emsp;A customer hoping to find Sir;  
His beard it was hanging before,  
&emsp;And his serpent’s tail twisting behind Sir:  

When Venus she brought him her son,  
&emsp;For tooth-drawing to tip him a guinea,  
Says he, “Ma’am your business is done  
&emsp;If you go to **Chevalier Ruspini**.”

“Pray who is Ruspini?” says she —   
&emsp;“A sage who to me was apprentic’d  
To learn all the myst’ry,” says he,  
&emsp;“That belongs to the trade of a Dentist.”

“I wonder, my dear Esculape,  
&emsp;*You* relinquish the lucrative custom  
Of giving our teeth all a scrape,  
&emsp;And selling a Dentifrice Nostrum!”

“Why, Venus, so great was the knack,  
&emsp;The skill and the cunning of the gent:  
That Pall Mall quickly saw my young quack  
&emsp;Surgeon-Dentist unto the Prince Regent:

“Opposition I found of no use,  
&emsp;My apprentice becoming so clever  
At drawing, or fixing, teeth loose;  
&emsp;And I gave up the bus’ness for ever.”
