The Phoenix sent cards to the whole feather’d race  
Inviting them all her assembly to grace  
But Phoebus, well pleas’d such a bevy to win  
Sent Mercury’s birdcage and lock’d them all in.    

The soft Tuscan nightingale, blackbird and dove  
Sat all in one corner like minstrels of love;  
The porcupine could not find room for a quill,  
But one little humming-bird push’d in her bill.  

The fam’d Grecian pigeon, once Venus’s care,  
And three sister-swans from Castalia were there,  
With *them* in the conclave an eagle’s eye shone  
Whose nest is where Phidias placed Jove on his throne.  

Apollo exclaim’d — “Such a prize, I protest,  
No bird fancier ever yet found in a chest;  
Their pinions may furnish new plumes for Love’s wing  
But who brought them all in one concert to sing?”  

The Blackbird replied — “We are captives and dumb  
Till Joy opes our cage and the Phoenix is come;  
If now you would hear us our music write  
Whisper three magic words — **Attic Readings Tonight!**”
