<span class="title">One way of raising the wind</span>

Captain Peale of Antigua, black’d his face and sold himself for a negro!  

Then wash’d the soot off, and escap’d with the money.

A half-hearted sweep, sans stockings, hat or shoes,  
Caught by the fragrance of spring-garden stews,  
Descends the area, and for food he cries —   
The smell’s enough for you, the Cook replies.  
Food, food! the boy rejoins, and takes his crust —   
Well then! since eat you will, now pay you must —   
With looks askant the cunning sweep withdraws,  
Clinking his halfpence in his sooty paws,  
Thanks! Master Cook — to pay I’ve no intent —   
As well you live by sound, as I by scent.
