Inscription upon a stone erected to the memory of a favorite dog — interred in a park in Upper Saxony

Near this low grave, now pensive and alone  
I think upon the mute companion — gone —   
By instinct taught, affectionate and kind  
How nearly rational was Leo’s mind!  
Bold as the animal whose name he bore  
As much attached as Argus was — of yore —   
The faithful servant by long trial proved  
The watchful guardian of the friend he loved.  
Oft in this silent unfrequented glade  
With him I’ve wandered, here — where now he’s laid,  
And should some lover seek this shaded spot  
To whisper vows, and hopes of happiest lot  
May he, while suing, watching, for a smile  
Use no false arts nor the fond maid beguile —   
Let him be cautious how he steals her heart  
Nor here perform the base deceiver’s part —   
But shun this chosen path, this hallowed grove  
’Tis sacred to fidelity, and love!
