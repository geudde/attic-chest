When darkly rose the louring morn,  
Tall waved the thickly-ripening corn,  
By Soignies’ Wood, as yet untorn  
&emsp;By war’s destructive enginry:

But, when a noontide beam had broke,  
How startled Soignies’ echoes woke  
To peals that swelled, mid fire and smoke,  
&emsp;Dread warfare’s fatal revelry!

In squares immovable arrayed,  
There shone the British bay’net blade,  
And many a gallant charger neighed  
&emsp;To meet the coming enemy.  

Then rolled the prodigal of blood  
Fast o’er the plain his armed flood,  
And like their cliffs the Britons stood,  
&emsp;Firm in unyielding bravery.

How poured the cannon’s sulph’rous breath,  
How thickly fell the volleying death,  
How steeped in blood th’ unfading wreath  
&emsp;That crowns this day’s dread mastery!

How glowed the crimson hue of even,  
Yet still they rush, to battle driven,  
And volumes still ascend to heaven  
&emsp;Of battle’s smouldering canopy.  

One effort more — the Tyrant’s last —   
’Tis foiled — he flies in coward haste,  
And leagued pursuers, following fast,  
&emsp;O’erwhelm his proudest chivalry.

When next those trampled fields shall wave,  
Their stems shall shelter many a grave,  
And many a heart shall mourn the brave  
&emsp;In Waterloo’s great sepulchre.
