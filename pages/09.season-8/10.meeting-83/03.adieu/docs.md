<span class="title">Adieu</span>

To say Adieu excites a tear,  
When from a friend we sever,  
Hard ’tis to part if harrowing fear  
Whispers we part for ever.  
Still hope will shed a softer gleam  
To dry the drop of sorrow,  
Again to meet, will sweeter seem  
Than joys that wealth can borrow.  

Long absent from the friend we love,  
If providence permitting,  
Again our friendship we can prove  
Then each sad grief forgetting.  
We feel a joy steal o’er the soul,  
While friendship’s call obeying,  
That seems with merciful control  
Our worst of woes repaying.
