Young Willy once liv’d in a peaceful vale,  
And had nothing to touch him with sorrow;  
He tended his sheep, and he told his tale,  
&emsp;And as yesterday, so was his morrow:  
&emsp;&emsp;Yet no moment could he measure  
&emsp;&emsp;By the traces of pleasure,  
&emsp;He sigh’d, he knew not wherefore,  
“Oh how dull is a lone shepherd’s life!”  
&emsp;He sigh’d, he knew not wherefore,
“Oh! how dull is a lone shepherd’s life!”

But Willy at last knew a Damsel fair,  
Who dispell’d his sad fancies by smiling;  
And his bosom was fill’d with pleasing care,  
&emsp;Ev’ry thought into rapture beguiling:  
&emsp;&emsp;Now each moment can he measure  
&emsp;&emsp;By the traces of pleasure,  
&emsp;He sigh’d, he knew not wherefore, 
’Twas that Lizzy might soon be his Wife!  
&emsp;He sigh’d, he knew not wherefore,
“Oh! how dull is a lone shepherd’s life!”
