The Voltaic Battery  

A Poem in Two Books

Book the 1st  

by Atticus Scriblerus Junr. a pupil of  

Electromagus

Oh thou unseen yet all-pervading power  
Source of the blast, the meteor and the shower  
Like the proud master of some Eastern throne  
Thy sway acknowledged, yet thyself unknown.  
Oh! hear thy slave, who on his throne of glass  
Woos thee bright Spirit, from the shining brass.  
Whether thou lovest to hear the thunder roll  
Or clothe in roseate light the burning pole,  
To bid the downy fibres horrent stand,  
Then touched collapse, but sting the venturous hand,  
Or balls of cork in nice suspension held  
Alternate move, attracted and repell’d,  
Or placed beneath th’excited glass advance,  
And fall and rise and urge the rapid dance.  
Oh! wheresoe’er thou art, my song inspire  
And breathe thy spirit o’er thy votary’s lyre  
To nerve its strings, but not to fuse the wire.  
Resplendent Power! to whom alike belong  
The flash *electric* and the flame of song.  
Oh smile on me, a genuine Child of Earth,  
Of genius guiltless, even from my birth.  
For Phoebus hid his light that fate morn  
Owls sung and monkeys danced when I was born.  
My Muse her charge with milk of asses fed  
And poppy syrup lavished on my bread  
Lest infant cries should rouse her from her bed.  
Then let thine inspiration richly flow  
Till all my soul with newborn ardour glow,  
In brilliant sparkles, pungent, long, and free  
To fire his soul who only writes of thee.  
Thyself I sing, my daring strain inspire  
And as thou lovest thy fame befriend my lyre,  
Say in what clime, from what distinguished man  
Thy favorite boast, thy powerful pile, began.  
	High favoured Frame! Let Britain vaunt no more  
Her Newton, glory of the years of yore!  
With foreign thieves his envied rights discuss  
Or artful Leibnitz claim his calculus[^1]  
Let all the sages join the loud acclaim  
And Newton’s light be lost in Volta’s fame![^2]

Connubial Love! whose wondrous influence can  
Brute nature’s soften, and ennoble man!  
Here grateful Science pays the tribute due —  
Her vaunted battery owes its birth to you!  

Galvani’s spouse, whose snowy fingers lave  
His soil’d cravats in the ablucient wave,  
Forgets how fast the precious moment steal,  
Forgets *her task* to dress their noontide meal.  
Her husband long had watch’d her as she stood,  
Her red arms buried in the foaming flood,  
Mark’d how she saw and strove with every stain,,  
And rubb’d and soap’d, and soap’d and rubb’d again,  
Mark’d how her cheeks with deeper crimson glow  
And drops of toil stand trembling on her brow.  
“Be mine,” he thought, “to ease thy household care,  
Myself our frogs for dinner will prepare!”  

The reptiles on a pewter platter laid  
Their limbs he separates with his iron blade,  
When lo! they start, convulsed with sudden life —  
He drops the blade, and trembling calls his wife.  
She comes, nor heeds attentive while she stands  
The chilling blast that chaps her reeking hands  
Surprised at each repeated touch to view,  
The frogs,[^3] long dead, revive and leap anew.

’Twas hence that Volta’s great and active mind  
Th’exciting metals variously combined,  
Till now complete, the wondrous pile was seen  
Of zinc and silver,[^4] with moist cloth between.  
What rapture thrill’d his soul, as in the dark  
He made the contact, saw the *sudden* spark  
And felt the stroke, that mystic strange control  
Which numbs the limbs but elevates the soul.

Nor let the sage in idiot wonder pause,  
“So great a triumph from so slight a cause!”  
What feeling mind can void of reverence pass  
O’er Newton’s apple or his broken glass.[^5]  
Or think unaw’d on Franklin’s soaring kite  
Its strings all horrent with electric light?  
The rankest weed may precious balm infold  
The touch of genius turns the dross to gold.

Seven is the golden number — seven are ours  
Of wonders, worthies, and mechanic powers.  
Seven were the Pleiades, the planets seven  
Till Olbers, Harding, Piazzi, found eleven.  
Sevan are the decades man enjoys at most,  
And seven the triumphs science loves to boast.  
The compass, type of constancy and hope,  
The air pump next, and next the telescope.  
Next electricity thy loved machine,  
And next are Faust’s ingenious labour seen.[^6]  
Steam’s mighty engine! glory of our Isle,  
And last, not least, the proud Voltaic Pile.

Descend Oh Muse! thy lofty spirit chain  
And breathe a humbler, more didactic strain.  
Tell with alternate strips of zinc and brass  
Immersed in water, held by cups of glass,  
How Volta formed his famed “Couronne des Tasses”  
And how, while acid water flowed betwixt,  
In wooden troughs the sodder’d plates were fix’d,  
How Babington the guardian porcelain gave  
And Davy raised the metals from the wave,  
Alas! the Muse disdains the *arid* task,  
In vain in Volta’s cherish’d name I ask,  
She scorns the Battery’s progress to relate  
But views its wonders in a perfect state.

When small the metal plates we always find  
The spark is feeble, and th’effect confined,  
At first th’effect increases with the size.  
But to this rule a limit Fate supplies.  
Large are plates we for *conductors* use  
To burn the charcoal or the wire to fuse,  
For *non-conductors* we prefer them small  
The size is useless here, the number all.  
From size intensity and strength are ours,  
From number quantity, and chemic powers,  
And oft a single pair of plates will urge  
The golden tests[^7] more strongly to diverge  
Than all that pile that from their stubborn earth  
First called the wondering metals into birth.

Between the plates when nitric acid plays  
Th’effect is stronger, but it soon decays.  
Bright is the spark, and long the glowing wire  
But waning light betrays the fading fire.  
With fainter glow when water flows between  
For months or years th’unchanging spark is seen.

Twice twenty plates, two feet by one, on fire,  
Will keep twelve inches of thick iron wire.  
Yet not from water bid one bubble rise  
Or give one grain of metal to our eyes,  
While with two thousand, inches four by four,  
The metals shine, the gaseous volumes soar,  
Yet will its power th’Electrometer spurn  
And not one inch of wire or carbon burn.  

’Tis thus — in Volta’s mighty pile we find,  
Electric force and chemic power combined[^8]  
But, like a pair of well adjusted scales,  
Whene’er we heighten one, the other fails.  
As in the spectrum of divided light  
The vermil rays superior heat excite,  
Yet there is nought of chemic power confessed,  
And e’en metallic oxides bear the test,  
But coldly where the violet lustre plays  
Their changing hues attest the chemic rays.  
When powerful acids chemic force excite  
And yellow fumes perplex the gazer’s sight,  
And trembling at his task, his lungs inhale  
The piercing vapours of the poison’d gale  
The chemistry in all her might descends  
And o’er the awful pile triumphant bends,  
While electricity with downcast eyes  
Soars on the tawny vapours as they rise,  
Yet smiles to see the plates so bright and clear  
In dirty oxides veil their glittering sheen  
And in her rival’s boasted pride of sway  
Her sceptre broken, and her strength decay.  
Like Semele, with mad ambition fired  
Who perish’d in the glory she desired,  
Or in the socket, as the expiring light  
Emits a brighter flash, and sinks in night.

When electricity triumphant tells  
The virtues of De Luc’s electric bells,  
Fair chemistry, who stands neglected by  
Feels her lost sway, and listens with a sigh  
Between his columns hears how true to time  
Fall the soft notes of his perpetual chime  
Despairing sees the plates so pure and bright  
And drops a tear to mar their silver light.[^9]


[^1]: The differential calculus, or theory of fluxions, discovered by Newton, but afterwards claimed by Leibnitz, who if he was not indebted to Newton’s observations, was at least posterior in discovery.

[^2]: What heresy! does Volta excel Newton? Yes! as a quack medicine excels the prescription of a physician. But Volta was no quack. No! but Galvani was. No poet but places his theme above all others if it be but an onion.

[^3]: Two metals are necessary to render this effect striking, tho’ one will produce it in a small degree. This discovery was the origin of Galvinism.

[^4]: Zinc and silver, or zinc and charcoal form the most powerful arrangement but zinc and copper is generally preferred, as being less expensive than the former, more durable than the latter, and not much inferior in power. The form of the pile is now generally discontinued, and that of the trough or battery adopted.

[^5]: An apple which fell on the head of Newton, while sleeping in his orchard, is said to have led to the development of the laws of gravity, and the accidental observation of the brilliant colours in a piece of broken glass, to his analysis of light. It is well known that Dr Franklin first established the identity of lightning and electricity, by means of a schoolboy’s kite.

[^7]: The gold leaves of the electrometer.

[^8]: The phenomena of attraction and repulsion, the brilliant light, the deflagration of metals, and that peculiar numbing sensation which can rather be felt than described, are owing to the electricity, and are much more powerfully displayed in a few alternations of large plates than in a great number of small ones. While the decomposition of bodies, and the violent heat produced by a battery consisting of a great number of small plates are the effects of its chemical power. Large plates are necessary for operating on conductors, where chemical power is required, the size is immaterial, and the number only of importance. From recent experiment it appears however that electric power does not increase uniformly with the size of the plates, nor chemical force with their number.
