Oh thou unseen yet all-pervading power  
Source of the blast, the meteor and the shower  
Like the proud master of some Eastern throne  
Thy sway acknowledged, yet thyself unknown.  
Oh! hear thy slave, who on his throne of glass  
Woos thee bright Spirit, from the shining brass.  
Whether thou lovest to hear the thunder roll  
Or clothe in roseate light the burning pole,  
To bid the downy fibres horrent stand,  
Then touched collapse, but sting the venturous hand,  
Or balls of cork in nice suspension held  
Alternate move, attracted and repell’d,  
Or placed beneath th’excited glass advance,  
And fall and rise and urge the rapid dance.  
Oh! wheresoe’er thou art, my song inspire  
And breathe thy spirit o’er thy votary’s lyre  
To nerve its strings, but not to fuse the wire.  
Resplendent Power! to whom alike belong  
The flash *electric* and the flame of song.  
Oh smile on me, a genuine Child of Earth,  
Of genius guiltless, even from my birth.  
For Phoebus hid his light that fate morn  
Owls sung and monkeys danced when I was born.  
My Muse her charge with milk of asses fed  
And poppy syrup lavished on my bread  
Lest infant cries should rouse her from her bed.  
Then let thine inspiration richly flow  
Till all my soul with newborn ardour glow,  
In brilliant sparkles, pungent, long, and free  
To fire his soul who only writes of thee.  
Thyself I sing, my daring strain inspire  
And as thou lovest thy fame befriend my lyre,  
Say in what clime, from what distinguished man  
Thy favorite boast, thy powerful pile, began.  
	High favoured Frame! Let Britain vaunt no more  
Her Newton, glory of the years of yore!  
With foreign thieves his envied rights discuss  
Or artful Leibnitz claim his calculus[^1]  
Let all the sages join the loud acclaim  
And Newton’s light be lost in Volta’s fame![^2]

Connubial Love! whose wondrous influence can  
Brute nature’s soften, and ennoble man!  
Here grateful Science pays the tribute due —  
Her vaunted battery owes its birth to you!  

Galvani’s spouse, whose snowy fingers lave  
His soil’d cravats in the ablucient wave,  
Forgets how fast the precious moment steal,  
Forgets *her task* to dress their noontide meal.  
Her husband long had watch’d her as she stood,  
Her red arms buried in the foaming flood,  
Mark’d how she saw and strove with every stain,,  
And rubb’d and soap’d, and soap’d and rubb’d again,  
Mark’d how her cheeks with deeper crimson glow  
And drops of toil stand trembling on her brow.  
“Be mine,” he thought, “to ease thy household care,  
Myself our frogs for dinner will prepare!”  

The reptiles on a pewter platter laid  
Their limbs he separates with his iron blade,  
When lo! they start, convulsed with sudden life —  
He drops the blade, and trembling calls his wife.  
She comes, nor heeds attentive while she stands  
The chilling blast that chaps her reeking hands  
Surprised at each repeated touch to view,  
The frogs,[^3] long dead, revive and leap anew.

’Twas hence that Volta’s great and active mind  
Th’exciting metals variously combined,  
Till now complete, the wondrous pile was seen  
Of zinc and silver,[^4] with moist cloth between.  
What rapture thrill’d his soul, as in the dark  
He made the contact, saw the *sudden* spark  
And felt the stroke, that mystic strange control  
Which numbs the limbs but elevates the soul.

Nor let the sage in idiot wonder pause,  
“So great a triumph from so slight a cause!”  
What feeling mind can void of reverence pass  
O’er Newton’s apple or his broken glass.[^5]  
Or think unaw’d on Franklin’s soaring kite  
Its strings all horrent with electric light?  
The rankest weed may precious balm infold  
The touch of genius turns the dross to gold.

Seven is the golden number — seven are ours  
Of wonders, worthies, and mechanic powers.  
Seven were the Pleiades, the planets seven  
Till Olbers, Harding, Piazzi, found eleven.  
Sevan are the decades man enjoys at most,  
And seven the triumphs science loves to boast.  
The compass, type of constancy and hope,  
The air pump next, and next the telescope.  
Next electricity thy loved machine,  
And next are Faust’s ingenious labour seen.[^6]  
Steam’s mighty engine! glory of our Isle,  
And last, not least, the proud Voltaic Pile.

Descend Oh Muse! thy lofty spirit chain  
And breathe a humbler, more didactic strain.  
Tell with alternate strips of zinc and brass  
Immersed in water, held by cups of glass,  
How Volta formed his famed “Couronne des Tasses”  
And how, while acid water flowed betwixt,  
In wooden troughs the sodder’d plates were fix’d,  
How Babington the guardian porcelain gave  
And Davy raised the metals from the wave,  
Alas! the Muse disdains the *arid* task,  
In vain in Volta’s cherish’d name I ask,  
She scorns the Battery’s progress to relate  
But views its wonders in a perfect state.

When small the metal plates we always find  
The spark is feeble, and th’effect confined,  
At first th’effect increases with the size.  
But to this rule a limit Fate supplies.  
Large are plates we for *conductors* use  
To burn the charcoal or the wire to fuse,  
For *non-conductors* we prefer them small  
The size is useless here, the number all.  
From size intensity and strength are ours,  
From number quantity, and chemic powers,  
And oft a single pair of plates will urge  
The golden tests[^7] more strongly to diverge  
Than all that pile that from their stubborn earth  
First called the wondering metals into birth.

Between the plates when nitric acid plays  
Th’effect is stronger, but it soon decays.  
Bright is the spark, and long the glowing wire  
But waning light betrays the fading fire.  
With fainter glow when water flows between  
For months or years th’unchanging spark is seen.

Twice twenty plates, two feet by one, on fire,  
Will keep twelve inches of thick iron wire.  
Yet not from water bid one bubble rise  
Or give one grain of metal to our eyes,  
While with two thousand, inches four by four,  
The metals shine, the gaseous volumes soar,  
Yet will its power th’Electrometer spurn  
And not one inch of wire or carbon burn.  

’Tis thus — in Volta’s mighty pile we find,  
Electric force and chemic power combined[^8]  
But, like a pair of well adjusted scales,  
Whene’er we heighten one, the other fails.  
As in the spectrum of divided light  
The vermil rays superior heat excite,  
Yet there is nought of chemic power confessed,  
And e’en metallic oxides bear the test,  
But coldly where the violet lustre plays  
Their changing hues attest the chemic rays.  
When powerful acids chemic force excite  
And yellow fumes perplex the gazer’s sight,  
And trembling at his task, his lungs inhale  
The piercing vapours of the poison’d gale  
The chemistry in all her might descends  
And o’er the awful pile triumphant bends,  
While electricity with downcast eyes  
Soars on the tawny vapours as they rise,  
Yet smiles to see the plates so bright and clear  
In dirty oxides veil their glittering sheen  
And in her rival’s boasted pride of sway  
Her sceptre broken, and her strength decay.  
Like Semele, with mad ambition fired  
Who perish’d in the glory she desired,  
Or in the socket, as the expiring light  
Emits a brighter flash, and sinks in night.

When electricity triumphant tells  
The virtues of De Luc’s electric bells,  
Fair chemistry, who stands neglected by  
Feels her lost sway, and listens with a sigh  
Between his columns hears how true to time  
Fall the soft notes of his perpetual chime  
Despairing sees the plates so pure and bright  
And drops a tear to mar their silver light.[^9]

**Book the Second**

All hail, Minerva! hail thy noble fane[^10]  
May science bless, and time confirm thy reign,  
May future Davys fill thy chemic chair  
Dear to the great, the wealthy, and the fair.  
’Twas thine, illustrious knight! ’twas thine to raise  
The work of Volta to immortal praise,  
And Truth must still when most she lauds thy name  
Own Volta’s pile the base of Davy’s fame.  

Oft, Fashion! have I seen thy votaries throng  
To hear the truths of science from his tongue,  
The groaning benches fill, the staircase grace  
For e’en that seat was then an envied place,  
And when his entrance joy’d the longing crowd  
What thunders shook the Circus, as he bowed  
And when the ceiling lower’d, in deepest gloom  
For nice experiment, involved the room,  
And by th’electric glare, he seem’d to stand  
Like some magician with his elvish band.  
(For by that livid and unearthly light  
Each dark assistant look’d an evil sprite,  
And the surrounding nymphs, their roses fled,  
Seem’d the pale spectres of the *summon’d* dead;)  
In oxygen when burnt the iron wire,  
Or charcoal fell in scintillating fire,  
Or when his brilliant gases might *induce*  
Each nymph a vest of iodine[^11] to *choose*  
Or when some metaphor announced his close  
How loud and long the rapturous plaudits rose.

How often have I seen with eager eyes  
The gas from decompounded water rise,  
The oxygen in gentle stream aspire  
Its course determined to the vitreous wire,  
The hydrogen in ampler volumes roll,  
And see with energy the minor pole.[^12]
  
But his what transport in that happy hour  
When the fixed[^13] alkalis confessed his power  
Besieged in vain, attacked in many a field,  
Victorious o’er a thousand foes, they yield!  
Oh! what new raptures filled his mind, to view  
The grains of newborn metal as they grew,  
Yet while they swelled in lustre pure and bright  
A cloud of oxide hide their silvery light,  
Mark on the crowd the Sage enraptured turns  
And cries, “I see it! Lo it burns! It burns!”

Sodium, potassium, long they vainly claim,  
The metals scarcely yield a brother’s name[^14]  
Proud of their stubborn frames, unequalled weight  
Their heat-defying powers and radiant light.  
They scorn the strangers who assert their right  
Whose plastic frames the moulding hand obey,  
Whose transient lustre scarcely hears the day,  
Who thrown on water, burn in floating fire,  
Or, pressed on ice, in sudden flames expire.[^15]

Ye antient worthies, pride’s false voice beware,  
Your rivals sleep in earth and float on air!  
Beneath the electric pile, in bright array  
See the young warriors rising into day!  
See o’er their forms in beamy splendour dressed  
Etherial naptha[^16] spreads her guardian vest!  
Their names expressive of their parent earth,  
Four shining strangers boast their kindred birth.  
And who is he, o’er whom a phantom fair  
Spreads her light pinions with maternal care.  
He shakes his spear with more than mortal grace  
Metallic offspring[^17] of etherial race.  
Ah, young ammonium! beauty’s wiles beware  
For thee an airy siren spreads the snare.  
See in her arms the fainting hero lies,  
From life and light she bears th’expiring prize.

E’en thus, alas! the Sage was borne away  
From the full light of science’s brightest day  
Not only round each mute attentive fair  
Mephitic chlorine floated on the air,  
The tainted gales love’s softer poison bear!  
Another Circe lights the fatal flame,  
And love and knighthood crop the buds of fame.  
Yes! Davy’s magic lips had charms to win  
From ball or theatre the New Corinne[^18]  
Ere on St Paul’s, the earliest sunbeam fell  
True to her chemic studies rose the Belle,[^19]  
And when for fashion’s nightly round arrayed  
Her sable locks their diamond wreath displayed  
The happy *Institution* still had power  
To claim the weekly tribute of an hour.  
But by her eyes’ soft fascination caught,  
She held entranced, the envied teacher fought,  
Oft felt he, while he held th’exited wire  
A spark more rapid than th’electric fire,  
And when he vow’d, “Should carbon own his power  
And science round him new-made diamonds shower  
The earliest triumphs of his art to bear  
A grateful tribute to each studious fair,  
Yet that those eyes which shone so oft on him  
Must surely make the brightest diamonds dim.”[^20]  
Oh then! now truly by his mien was shown,  
He spoke to all, but only thought of one!

But oh! dread source of immaterial light,  
What nameless splendours burst upon my sight;  
What fierce volcanoes rage, what meteors glare,[^21]  
What sounds, what sights, around, in earth, in air!  
My spirit faints before the dazzling ray —  
In mercy spare th’unutterable day.  
Enough for me with weak and trembling string  
The present triumphs of thy power to sing.  
Let happier bards thy future fame relate,  
And see the glories of thy heavenly state,  
But on mine eyes, oh let thy favour stream,  
A mild, a steady, but a softened beam.  
Or I, like Milton with excess of light  
May sink o’erpowered, and droop in *endless* night.

Close by the pile, behold on either hand  
In hostile guise a numerous army stand[^22]  
In vain her succour powerful friendship lends  
Or chemistry the olive branch extends.  
Thro’ all temptations on they freely roll  
True as the needle to their favourite pole.

Oh Man! inconstant, treacherous, insincere  
Oh! blush to see the bright example here!  
Blush deep, to think how oft thy race have sold  
Their truth, for ease, for pleasure, or for gold!  
What man while wandering in the desert sees  
The crystal fountain sparkling thro’ the trees,  
Nor leaves his path to seek the sheltered spot  
His trust neglected, and his haste forgot?  
Or faint and weary, who with careless eye  
Will pass untouched, the tempting banquet by.  
Yet alkalis thro’ winning acids pass,  
Unmixed, unaltered, to th’appointed glass,  
And while the acids own electric reign,  
Their long loved alkalis attract in vain![^23]  
Oh electricity, thy power is great,  
When senseless matter thus can own thy state  
But greater were thy glory, couldst thou bind  
To truth and honour man’s deceitful mind!  
Enough the lyre has rung with Davy’s fame,  
Electric science boasts a nobler name!  
The glory of our town, our isle, our age.  
The poet’s friend, the wonder-working Sage.  
Electromagus, he who first defined,  
The power electric o’er the human mind.[^24]  
The works of genius meaner bards may tell,  
Long on her antient favourites fame may dwell,  
But still the purer, nobler praise his lot,  
Who gives the flame, where Nature gave it not.  
Who bids its fervor frozen age inspire,  
Or mid the fog of dullness lights the fire —  
No more shall bards for inspiration run  
To soft Vaucluse or older Helicon,  
No more from Bacchus shall the poet’s mind  
And transient and insidious vigour find,  
Or drink it, like the insect of an hour,  
Or Persian genie, from some fragrant flower,  
Or seek the vulgar streams of ale or beer,  
A purer fount of sacred song is here!

E’en those where Spurzheim’s practised touch in vain  
Would seek a single organ thro’ their brain,  
On whom their flattered, narrow skulls at once  
Impose the dread opprobrious name of Dunce;  
Let such but come, but touch th’electric wire  
And thro’ their soul quick darts th’unwonted fire.  
Yes! let this happy age, no longer blind,  
Own electricity the Queen of Mind,  
This cranioscopic, cerviologic sage  
Must lower his standard to Electromage,  
And what of good his system offers, own,  
He owes that good to her, and her alone.

Nor be, O Aircastle! unsung thy name  
Who raised the Sage to honour and to fame,  
See pouring down the steep descent of time  
Rich with a thousand rills, the stream of rhyme  
With electricity’s augmented force  
No longer narrow bounds confine its course.  
The widening current shall for age endure  
Swift as a torrent, as a fountain pure,  
And bear upon its waves, to endless fame  
Electromagus and his Patron’s Name.

Finis







[^1]: The differential calculus, or theory of fluxions, discovered by Newton, but afterwards claimed by Leibnitz, who if he was not indebted to Newton’s observations, was at least posterior in discovery.

[^2]: What heresy! does Volta excel Newton? Yes! as a quack medicine excels the prescription of a physician. But Volta was no quack. No! but Galvani was. No poet but places his theme above all others if it be but an onion.

[^3]: Two metals are necessary to render this effect striking, tho’ one will produce it in a small degree. This discovery was the origin of Galvinism.

[^4]: Zinc and silver, or zinc and charcoal form the most powerful arrangement but zinc and copper is generally preferred, as being less expensive than the former, more durable than the latter, and not much inferior in power. The form of the pile is now generally discontinued, and that of the trough or battery adopted.

[^5]: An apple which fell on the head of Newton, while sleeping in his orchard, is said to have led to the development of the laws of gravity, and the accidental observation of the brilliant colours in a piece of broken glass, to his analysis of light. It is well known that Dr Franklin first established the identity of lightning and electricity, by means of a schoolboy’s kite.

[^6]: The printing machine.

[^7]: The gold leaves of the electrometer.

[^8]: The phenomena of attraction and repulsion, the brilliant light, the deflagration of metals, and that peculiar numbing sensation which can rather be felt than described, are owing to the electricity, and are much more powerfully displayed in a few alternations of large plates than in a great number of small ones. While the decomposition of bodies, and the violent heat produced by a battery consisting of a great number of small plates are the effects of its chemical power. Large plates are necessary for operating on conductors, where chemical power is required, the size is immaterial, and the number only of importance. From recent experiment it appears however that electric power does not increase uniformly with the size of the plates, nor chemical force with their number.

[^9]: The large battery at the Royal Institution, consisting of 4,000 plates of four inches diameter, when the troughs are filled with a strong acid solutions, and it is in high power for chemical decomposition, produces even less electrical effect, than a battery of twenty plates charged with water, or even the contact and separation of a single pair; on the contrary in the Voltaic columns of M. de Luc, the effect is entirely electrical. In the former instance, the fumes which arise from the chemical action of the acid on the metals, destroys the insulation, and consequently the electrical effect. In the Voltaic column, on the other hand, the electrical effects are perfect, as long only as the whole apparatus is kept dry, that is, as long as there is no chemical action on the metals. A sunbeam is composed of three parts: light, heat, and some invisible rays producing chemical effects, possibly by some electrical actions. When the ray is divided by the prism, the heat is found to be greater in the red rays, and in certain invisible rays beyond them, but here no chemical effects are observable, while on the contrary, in the violet rays, and in certain invisible rays beyond the coloured spectrum, little heat is detected, and the chemical effects are strong. In the red rays metallic oxides are unaltered, but they soon tarnish in the violet lights or the invisible rays beyond.

[^10]: The Royal Institution.

[^11]: Iodine, so called from, Ion, a violet. “A substance producing a violet coloured gas when heated.”

[^12]: Water consists of one volume of oxygen combined with two of hydrogen. In its decomposition the oxygen, being negative, is evolved at the positive pole, and the hydrogen, being positive, at the negative.

[^13]: The alkalis potash and soda obtained their name of *fixed*, not more in opposition to ammonia, the volatile alkali, than from their having resisted every effort to decompose them, till Professor Davy thought of applying to them the energies of Voltaic electricity, and developed their metallic bases. The metal was formed in small globules which either burned at the moment of their production, or were reabsorbed in oxygen.

[^14]: The French chemists long denied the name of metals to sodium and potassium, which they called Hydrureto. The characteristics which distinguish them can scarcely be more concisely given than in the text.

[^15]: The new metals unite so greedily with oxygen, that they inflame in combination. Potassium is lighter than water, and flames as it floats. Sodium is rather heavier, and burns at the bottom.

[^16]: The metals of the earths and alkalis can only be preserved by covering them with naptha, a spirit produced by the distillation of aether, and the lightest of all known fluids.

[^17]: Ammonia, the volatile alkali, is produced by the union of two gases, hydrogen and nitrogen. Ammonium is the metallic basis of ammonia. Either hydrogen or nitrogen must therefore be compound bodies, most probably nitrogen. Ammonium has hitherto been procured in such small quantities, and so minute a portion of oxygen is sufficient to regenerate the alkali, that it has been found impossible to keep it.

[^18]: The fair lady who afterwards so fully *appreciated* the merits of Davy, was very generally known by the appellation of the “New Corinne”, though she assured her friends that notwithstanding the universal supposition, and her great intimacy with Mme. De Stael at the time, she really was not the Corinne of that illustrious writer.

[^19]: Mrs Apreece used to receive chemical lessons from Professor Day in her dressing room at 6 o’clock in the morning.

[^20]: Feb. 19th 1810 At an evening lecture Professor Davy made this promise.

[^21]: Professor Davy supposes the metals of the earths to be instrumental in the eruptions of volcanoes and the combustion of meteoric stones.

[^22]: All known bodies are capable of being resolved into two great classes, those naturally pos. which seek by the well known electrical law of reciprocal attraction and repulsion the neg. end of the battery, and those bodies naturally neg. which arrange themselves round the pos. wire.

[^23]: The memorable experiment is well known, in which by the force of electrical attraction, Professor Davy neutralized chemical affinity, when the acids placed at the positive pole passed thro’ a stratum of alkali to the negative, and the alkalis proceeded thro’ the acid to the positive, without combination.

[^24]: Electromagus: The discourse of the important fact on which this poem is founded, that electricity is the source of all poetical inspiration, a discourse worthy to be recorded in the letters of gold. May the Voltaic battery, the source of all his fire; May his kind instructor and benefactor, Electromagus; May that instructor’s munificent friend and patron, Lord Aircastle, receive this humble tribute from the gratitude of their most devoted pupil, Atticus Scriblerus Junior.
