The Captive Lark forgets to sing,  
And idly beats, with flutt’ring wing  
And open’d beak, in fruitless rage,  
The narrow limits of his cage:  
&emsp;Yet soon tamed, and accustom’d  
&emsp;&emsp;His flights to forego,  
&emsp;He cheerly sweetly warbles,  
&emsp;&emsp;Forgetful of woe.

And thus the Youth, whose free-born soul  
Is new to tyrant Love’s control,  
Laments, and struggles oft in vain  
To break or loose the magic chain:  
&emsp;Yet soon, taught what pleasure  
&emsp;&emsp;A true Love warms,  
&emsp;He fondly sweetly warbles  
&emsp;&emsp;His dear Idol’s charms.
