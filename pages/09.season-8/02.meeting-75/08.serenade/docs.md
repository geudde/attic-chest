Awake, Love, the moon’s beam  
Shines bright on Tejo’s stream,  
And fragrant the breeze blows  
From bow’rs where blooms the rose;  
&emsp;Arise, Love, and listen  
While Pedro sings with fond delight  
A Lover’s Song by night!  

2

Arise, Love, each proud star  
Shall own that brighter far  
Than gild night’s blue cope, rise  
In my Eulalia’s eyes.  
&emsp;Arise, Love, and listen!  
And beam those eyes with soft delight  
On Lover’s Song by night!  

3

As once Pedro’s song woke,  
Light from thy lattice broke;  
And thrill’d thro the still air  
Eulalia’s sweet guitar;  
&emsp;For aye could I listen,  
Or sing responsive with delight  
My Lover’s Song by night!  

4

Awake, Love, night’s sweet bird,  
Tho’ now with rapture heard,  
For envy shall mute be,  
Her song surpass’d by thee;  
&emsp;Arise, Love, and listen,  
Or sing responsive with delight  
A Song of Love by night!
