Since Ridicule a plea put in  
Your verdict at my cost to win  
I move the court and beg relief  
**Ex Parte Pocket Handkerchief**.

Though now no more my kindred deck  
With starch and wires the stately neck,  
Shall I, whose origin and race  
Scarce mighty Trusler’s self could trace.  
I, from the looms of Gallia drawn  
(Pure cambric, or at least long lawn)  
I, whose extremities are rich  
With pearls of point — or satin stitch,  
Shall I hang out like Sorrow’s flag  
Or dwell imprisoned in a bag?  

Who’er my snow-white pomp beholds  
Or scents my incense-breathing folds  
Well knows how aptly and how oft  
With waving grace and blandish soft  
I utter more than words can reach  
And crown the flourishes of speech.  
I fill a learned Brother’s pause  
While ermined Judges weigh the cause;  
Or when the argument grows weaker,  
Adorn the bow to “Mr Speaker!”  
What stage-box beauty takes her stand  
Till I unfold to arm her hand?  
Would Erskine’s self unroll a brief  
Without his Pocket-Handkerchief?  
I grace the widow’s holy woe,  
I hide the tear which ought to flow:  
And dipp’d in rare Circassian dew  
Her bloom with patent-pink renew —  
Jury of gentle dames! if e’er  
Ye hope to shed that precious tear,  
Or in a lover’s eye to see  
The drop so seldom claim’d by me,  
Let not imperious Fashion rend  
From Beauty’s side her ancient Friend  
With fans and card-purses to roam  
An Exile from our native home:  
While fair-ones whisper, “Look my dear,  
How came that vagrant kerchief here?  
A token of distress, no doubt!  
Well, show the truant thing about.”  
Let me again with pence and keys  
Salts, scissors, thimbles and etwees,  
Enrich the Pocket’s ample store  
As in those blissful days of yore  
When even Beauty’s hands might hem,  
And true-love’s tears my whiteness gem:  
But if, by thankless Fashion’s doom,  
I only come to waste perfume,  
The Muses’ ridicule to fit,  
And flutter where the Graces sit,  
Still let me fall on classic ground  
And in your Attic Chest be found!
