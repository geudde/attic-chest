Since Ridicule a plea put in  
Your verdict at my cost to win  
I move the court and beg relief  
**Ex Parte Pocket Handkerchief**.

Though now no more my kindred deck  
With starch and wires the stately neck,  
Shall I, whose origin and race  
Scarce mighty Trusler’s self could trace.  
I, from the looms of Gallia drawn  
(Pure cambric, or at least long lawn)  
I, whose extremities are rich  
With pearls of point — or satin stitch,  
Shall I hang out like Sorrow’s flag  
Or dwell imprisoned in a bag?  

Who’er my snow-white pomp beholds  
Or scents my incense-breathing folds  
Well knows how aptly and how oft  
With waving grace and blandish soft  
I utter more than words can reach  
And crown the flourishes of speech.
