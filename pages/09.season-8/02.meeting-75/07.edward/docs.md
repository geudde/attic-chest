Sadly reclining under a willow,  
&emsp;Inwardly pining Edward was laid;  
Rushes his couch were, the green moss his pillow,  
&emsp;Darker this thoughts than the sad-waving shade.  
&emsp;Faster his tears than the babbling brook strayed.

“Lost is the treasure fondly I cherish’d —  
&emsp;Fled is the pleasure that all could illume —  
Lovely illusions, with her ye have perish’d,  
&emsp;Leaving naught here but despondence and gloom:  
&emsp;Myra is laid in the dark silent tomb!

“Yet sure her spirit, purity’s semblance,  
&emsp;Bliss does inherit sainted above;  
Sorrow shall melt into holy remembrance,  
&emsp;Union mysterious and sweet shall we prove;  
&emsp;Mortal her frame, but immortal our Love!”
