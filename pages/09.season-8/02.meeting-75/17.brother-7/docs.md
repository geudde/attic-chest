Past is the rosy dawn of youth  
When life was love, and love was truth,  
When Hope in Fancy’s blooming bow’rs  
Lay cradled on elysian flow’rs:  
Yet stay, Magicians! stay and raise  
The spirit of departed days!  
One trace of lost affection save  
And plant your myrtles round her grave!  

On calm Cashmeria’s darkest dell  
The welcome dews of ev’ning fell,  
While on the golden Iama’s spray  
The plaintive cozel trill’d her lay  
Unfelt, unheard by him whose head  
Press’d softly on its fragrant bed.  
He dream’d of heav’n! for oft he turn’d  
His cheek where kindling rapture burn’d;  
And scarce his eye’s reposing lid  
The spark of sweet delirium hid.  
But ’midst those sprays of clust’ring gold  
A serpent wreath’d its glossy fold;  
Awhile its secret vigil kept  
Then to the slumb’ring Pilgrim crept —  
It paus’d — it shrank! — a silver sound  
Spread in melodious murmurs round;  
Its fierce eye gleam’d — the reed again  
Pour’d softly slow a fainter strain:  
The startled foe forgot its prey,  
And roll’d its burnish’d coils away.  

Was it a form of painted light  
Stole on the waking Pilgrim’s sight?  
A fairer seraph never bent  
From holy mount or firmament!  
The lucid blue of eastern skies  
Swam in the light of Ora’s eyes,  
As from her snowy brow she drew  
The floating gauze of silv’ry hue  
Thin as the filmy cloud which steals  
Tints from the moonbeam it conceals.  
Tho’ with her jet-black tresses wreath’d  
The flow’r of love its incense breath’d,  
Its crimson blossoms could not vie  
With youthful Beauty’s living dye.  
The sylvan reed beside her hung  
Whose music sheath’d the serpent’s tongue —  
She spoke — so sweet a voice might close  
A demon’s eye in bland repose!  

“Wake! pilgrim, wake! the flow’rs which shed  
Such fragrance round thy dewy bed,  
These flow’rs, of potent vapours full,  
In deathful sleep thy senses lull.  
Wake! poison mingles with thy breath —  
Thy golden couch is bright with death!” 

O Beauty! — tender as the leaves  
The water-loving lotos weaves,  
Enrich’d and freshen’d by the tide  
Which mantles round its virgin pride!  
Thou, like the lotos, half unseen,  
Should’st love the cool sequester’d screen;  
But parch’d by Passion’s fervid rays  
Thy pride to painted dust decays  
As in Lahore’s forsaken glades  
The painted tulip flames and fades!  
 
Two moons have silver’d Delhi’s plain,  
Another hastens to its wane,  
Yet still the Pilgrim loves to stray  
Where rich Cashmeria’s waters play:  
Beneath the fig-tree’s green arcade  
He seeks his rose-lipp’d Indian maid  
And lingers near while oft and long  
Mild Ora trills her ev’ning song;  
Or warbles through Circassian reeds  
Or bends o’er Brahma’s sacred beads.  
The antelope with fearless eye  
Beholds her smile and gambols nigh;  
And well the gazing pilgrim feels  
The secret which that smile reveals.  

But when in lonely trance he lies  
For distant lands the Pilgrim sighs;  
In dreams his long-lost home he sees  
Its yellow glens and tow’ring trees;  
His hall with laurel’d trophies stor’d,  
His kinsmen smiling round his board:  
And by his side the noble dame  
His bounding heart aspires to claim —  
He wakes — and hears the plaintive lay  
Which lur’d the serpent from its prey.  

Yet once again, unseen awhile,  
He looks on sleeping Ora’s smile;  
A ling’ring sunbeam seems to spread  
Its halo round her peaceful head;  
The sylvan reed, Affection’s prize,  
Beneath her dewy pillow lies:  
One tear, Affection’s parting meed,  
Falls softly on that precious reed —  
“Sweet Ora! — lov’d, but lov’d in vain,  
Farewell — thy spotless rest retain!  
Too long on Danger’s dizzy brink  
My soul has lean’d, but shall not sink.  
My promis’d bride forsaken weeps,  
My country calls, my honour sleeps:  
Restore thy vows to Brahma’s shrine,  
Deserted Duty summons mine.” 
		
		
From Delhi’s plain the Pilgrim hastes  
O’er dark Lahore’s unmeasur’d wastes,  
Till deep within its deepest vale  
He shuns the desert’s poison’d gale  
Where many a green and flowr’y isle  
Seems on the silver lake to smile.  
Alas! the wearied pilgrim’s feet  
Those ever-floating islands cheat;  
Sport of the frolic tide, they move,  
Unfix’d as friendship, joy, and love!  

’Midst lonely thickets, deep and dank,  
He pauses on the frowning bank:  
The moon is dim — the path is drear,  
Yon forest hides the tiger’s lair —  
A meagre form beside him stands  
With muffled brow and folded hands.  
“Who haunts my path?” — “Thine eyes behold  
A wand’ring Outcast, poor and old,  
Whom Brahma’s awful heralds doom  
To perish in unfriended gloom.  
But on my face thou canst not gaze,  
No hand this holy hood shall raise;  
The signet on this blasted brow  
No mortal eye shall ever know.  
Yet follow me! — my staff shall aid  
Thy footsteps thro’ this baleful shade:  
The moon which beams on Brahma’s dome  
Shines on the Outcast’s humble home.”

Safe to his couch of matted reeds  
His guest the woe-worn Outcast leads —  
The naptha’s blue and fitful blaze  
Amidst a pile of spikenard plays;  
While oft in cups of lotos pour’d  
The cocoa yields its milky hoard.  
“Now rest in peace! the morning ray  
Shall guide thee on thy lonely way;  
But go not till yon foes are past  
Whose death-yell echoes on the blast.  
To-night in Brahma’s sacred cave  
A thousand lurid torches wave;  
A thousand vengeful priests proclaim  
One faithless Outcast’s guilt and shame.  
Yet mourn her not! — Amreeta’s bowl  
Has steep’d in peace her banish’d soul.  
Sleep, stranger! — hope and joy are thine,  
To-morrow’s sun for thee shall shine!”

The morn’s first rays of rosy red  
Gleam on the bounteous Outcast’s head:  
He slumbers near his pilgrim-guest,  
His wan hands folded on his breast.  
Why fear the trembling guest to trace  
The secrets of that shrouded face?  
Those hands are stiff — that breast is cold —  
He rends the sable mantle’s fold —  
Ah, wretch! — that impious glance forbear!  
Forsaken Ora’s face is there! 

On Indu’s drear and hated shore  
The pilgrim’s feet are seen no more;  
In Albion’s sunless isle he roves,  
A stranger to his native groves: —  
No kinsmen wait his social call,  
No bridal banquet warms his hall —  
The prize he sought — the noble dame  
More lov’d than beauty, wealth, or fame,  
A luckless Pilgrim’s faith disdains  
And barters truth for golden chains:  
But ever to his dreaming ear  
Mild Ora’s tuneful reed is near;  
And still in angel beauty dressed,  
Her spotless spirit guards his rest.
