Yes! time *will* steal the rose away,  
The fairest form will soon decay  
&emsp;&emsp;And like the lily bend to earth.  
Yet still the bleaching hand of time  
Must not be chargâ€™d with fading mime  
&emsp;&emsp;But scenes of *grief* instead of mirth.

And yet methinks; when age comes on,  
And all the *life* of *love* is gone  
&emsp;&emsp;When youth and blooming health are fled  
The charms of virtue *then* will shine  
Oh, may those charms be ever mind  
&emsp;&emsp;And shed a lustre round my head.

E.R.  
April 24th 1816
