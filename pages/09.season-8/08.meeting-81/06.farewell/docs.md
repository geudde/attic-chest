“Fare thee well” — no artful numbers,  
&emsp;Here dissembled feelings tell,  
Grief my faltering strain encumbers,  
&emsp;Friendship weeps to say, farewell.  
While the Summer flowers are blowing  
&emsp;While the balmy zephyrs play,  
While the billows, gently flowing  
&emsp;Sparkle in the golden ray,  
Then I bid thee not remember,  
&emsp;Friends that mourn bereft of thee.  
Mid the storms of dark December,  
&emsp;Then perchance thou’lt think of me.

Yes! whene’er the roaring ocean,  
&emsp;Every breast with terror fills,  
When the winds in loud commotion  
&emsp;Sweep along the barren hills,  
When the wither’d leaves are strewing  
&emsp;Fields they loved to shade of late,  
Think that we thy loss are rueing  
&emsp;As the turtle mourns his mate.  
Then perchance if ocean slumbers,  
&emsp;And the breezes softer blow,  
Think the wail of Attic Numbers,  
&emsp;Echoed in his solemn flow.

Oh! be Health in every billow  
&emsp;May she breathe in every gale,  
Soothe thee on thy tranquil pillow,  
&emsp;Guide thy wanderings thro’ the vale.  
Give new sweets to every blossom,  
&emsp;Sorrow from thy side beguile,  
Make the gleam on Ocean’s bosom,  
&emsp;Seem some friend’s remember’d smile.  
Every day fresh beauties ravish,  
&emsp;Fairer than they seem’d before,  
Nor on thee too fondly lavish,  
&emsp;All her rich invalued store,  
But on *those* alike bestowing,  
&emsp;Objects of thy anxious cares,  
Till thy heart with joy o’erflowing  
&emsp;Read thy weal, thy bliss, in theirs.  
Then shall strains of Attic Mourning  
&emsp;Cease — thy vacant seat to see,  
And with genial Spring returning  
&emsp;Joy shall find new Spring in thee.
