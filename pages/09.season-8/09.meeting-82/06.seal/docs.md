The seal with awful silence lift  
&emsp;Which guards the spell of plums and spicing!  
Three smiling Graces carv’d the gift,  
&emsp;Three busy Cupids stole the icing.

This paper sprang from purest flax  
&emsp;Spun by the matron-hands of Duty:  
Love held the taper, and the wax  
&emsp;Was redden’d by the blush of Beauty.  

Let maiden hands divide the prize  
&emsp;Rich with triumphant Hymen’s blessing,  
Then Hope shall bless your dreaming eyes  
&emsp;With ev’ry treasure worth possessing!

May 2d 1816
