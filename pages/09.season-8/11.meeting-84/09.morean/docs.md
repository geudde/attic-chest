<span class="title">Stepanopoli and Dimitri</span>

“Golden treasury of charms  
Pearl of price in rapture’s bower,  
Hush! ah hush, thy fond alarms!  
Give, ah give the happy hour!  

“Not the lofty cypress shows,  
More of majesty and grace,  
Fades the vainly pleasing rose,  
When my love unveils her face!  

“Eyes of diamond, how your *glance*  
Shames the sun’s meridian light!  
Beam ye on the lover’s *trance*  
And he dies in wild delight!”

Young Stepanopoli thus sung  
As the responsive lyre he rung  
And critic ears might seek in vain  
To banquet on a sweeter straing.  
Though ’twas St. George’s festal day  
And many a Greek from Corinth’s bay  
Pogliesi’s mount, Nemea’s wood,  
Steno, or Stymphalus thy flood,  
With blithe Arcadia’s shepherds came  
To celebrate their patron’s fame.  
The gentle South the air perfumes,  
The sun Taygetus’ tops illumes,  
When from the chapel’s holy cell  
The notes of praise symphonious swell  
And silently the crowd without  
Bend to the earth with awe devout,  
But soon, the holy service done  
The sports and feasting are begun;  
Beneath the high o’erarching shade,  
In groups the rustic banquet’s laid;  
To measured tones the nymphs advance  
To Caudian or Romaic dance  
And notes of love or joy prolong  
To many a lyire the choral song.  
But Stepanopoli, apart  
With Dimitri who shared his heart  
On roasted lamb luxurious feasted  
And generous wine and converse tasted.  
The banquet past, the friends prolong  
Their pleasure in alternate song.

“’Tis sweet to view the flowing meads  
&emsp;Reclining under jasmine bowers  
&emsp;Inhaling balm from thousand flowers  
But what’s the joy that this exceeds?  

“’Tis sweet to fill our mantling glasses  
&emsp;Near a cool and crystal fountain,  
&emsp;Shaded by yon woody mountain,  
But what joy this joy surpasses?   

“The miser loves to count his treasure,  
&emsp;Deep within a secret cave  
&emsp;Whose dark recess all eyes may brave  
But what give us livelier pleasure?  

“What charms all earthly joy above?  
&emsp;What to the prince or peasant’s heart  
&emsp;The grave or gay, can bliss impart?  
Joy of all joys, all powerful love!”

Here when the master of the feast  
His various harmony had ceased  
Dimitri rais’d his grateful lays  
His friend to thank — his friend to praise.  
He wished him centuries of health,  
A round of pleasures, hoards of wealth —   
He paus’d — but e’er he sang again  
Woke Philomela’s dulcet strain
And Stepanopoli exclaims  
“List! Music’s triumph she proclaims —   
How doth the nightingale rejoice  
To imitate my ductile voice!”  
“Nay,” cries Dimitri, “I opine  
Since last I sung, she copies mine!”  
“Thy croaking voice!” — “Thy languid strain!”  
“Thou guest ungrateful!” — “Songster vain!”  
Louder their angry words arose  
Till ends the fierce dispute in blows,  
And each before the Cadi goes  
Sage Mustaphi in awful state  
Heard and reviewed the sharp debate;  
Nay, e’ev their mutual songs he heard,  
Twirling his whiskers and his beard.  
Impartial justice then to show,  
He fined them both, for every blow  
And gravely said, “It now remains  
To say, for whom the bulbul’s strains:  
Then go your ways, learn to agree,  
For, infidels, she sang for me.”
