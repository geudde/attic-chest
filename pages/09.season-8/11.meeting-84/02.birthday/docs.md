<span class="title">July 14th</span>

While others grace thy natal day  
&emsp;With festive dance and song  
A pilgrim leaves his silent way  
&emsp;To mingle in the throng.  
When thou are near, a haggard face  
A lonely lock, a ling’ring pace  
&emsp;No more to me belong;  
For only souls like thine can prove  
How swift my ample pinions move.

I will not boast how oft and bright  
&emsp;That day I mean to bring,  
For many a downy plume last night  
&emsp;Thy bounty gave my wing.  
Thy mirth my rosy crown bestow’d,  
To thee my sparkling glass I ow’d —   
&emsp;Now take my offering:  
Thou canst not find so pure a prize  
In Pleasure’s gayest paradise!  

’Midst sands which glisten in my glass  
&emsp;No richer gem I find;  
The rest may glimmer, break, and pass  
&emsp;But this remains behind:  
Pride may the modest pearl disdain  
And Love a brittle semblance feign,  
&emsp;But Pride and Love are blind;  
They mock my pow’r — yet I alone  
Their fraudful counterfeits make known.  

Receive my gift! — of Nature’s wealth  
&emsp;Thy soul has ample store;  
Of Wisdom, Honour, Hope and Health  
&emsp;I cannot give thee more:  
But that which Wealth can never buy  
Shall Youth’s electric glow supply  
&emsp;When thou, like me, are hoar:  
I bring what Fortune cannot lend —   
Time, only Time reveals a Friend!
