Dear Rhoda, our friends are ungrateful,  
&emsp;Yet who can give more when they wed?  
We sent them of bride cake a plate-full,  
&emsp;And feasted ourselves on Brown Bread.   

Our cake like ourselves was unspotted  
&emsp;With gilding and paint — white or red;  
To us not a plum is allotted  
&emsp;But honesty, peace and Brown Bread.

Our paper no essences scented,  
&emsp;No Cupids emboss’d it, ’tis said—  
But we with Love’s essence acquainted  
&emsp;Have kept it to grace our Brown Bread. 

Let those who love sweetmeats and spices  
&emsp;By Charlotte and Leopold be fed;  
But while in our bosoms no ice is  
&emsp;We’ll find sweets enough in Brown Bread.

Not once, when I look’d on thy beauty  
&emsp;Did eatables enter my head,  
Till sighing I thought how thy duty  
&emsp;Might doom thee to share my Brown Bread.   

Yet Fortune herself in her blindness  
&emsp;No gall on our morsel shall shed;  
No tear but the sweet one of kindness  
&emsp;Shall moisten our meal of Brown Bread.   

May hearts of such kindness unmindful,  
&emsp;Remain with their crust over-spread!  
They know not how faces like thine full  
&emsp;Of smiles, may embellish Brown Bread.   

Gay Wit may illumine the table,  
&emsp;While elegance sits at the head;  
But only Good Nature is able  
&emsp;To make a regale of Brown Bread.   

Then Rhoda! bid scorners good-bye too—  
&emsp;When Fortune and Fancy are fled  
Fame, Fashion, and Friendship will fly too,  
&emsp;And leave them to welcome Brown Bread.   

But when by the proud world forsaken  
&emsp;Our white cottage-threshold they tread,  
Their cup at our board shall be taken  
&emsp;With blessings, and half our Brown Bread!
