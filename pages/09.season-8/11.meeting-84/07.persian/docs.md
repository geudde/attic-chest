Fair one, take this rose and wreathe it  
&emsp;In thy braided hair;  
A brighter bloom will be beneath it  
&emsp;Take this rose, my Fair!  
The flower which once was seen to glow  
So lovely on thy snow-white brow  
&emsp;Lov’d thy lip and lightly shed  
&emsp;One dewy leaf of rosy red  
To blush forever there.

Take this lily, Love, and twine it  
With thy waving hair;  
T’will deck thy ringlets — why decline it?  
&emsp;Take this flow’r, my fair!  
And yet its blossoms, pure and pale,  
In beauty on thy brow will fail;  
That brow attracts all eyes to thee  
And none will choose or chance to see  
&emsp;The Lily fading there!

Mem. This will do for Sir Pertinax Townly’s next billet-doux to Erminia with a bouquet. He shall have it for 4s 6d ready money.The Editor of the M.H. offered 5s but asked 2 years credit.

On the Hon. Cathaline L—-’s Marriage to Mr Day

Ah! why is Woman’s glory lent  
To gild so short a space?  
Is Beauty’s rosebud only meant  
One happy **Day** to grace?  
Yet if kind fate a Day provide  
For no tomorrow stay:  
Choose fair ones, like yon happy Bride  
And never lose a **Day**.

This fetched me half a guinea, but it won’t serve another occasion.

’Tis not a form of Parian mold  
That with Apollo’s might have vied;  
Nor swelling stores of Indian gold  
Nor purple pow’r, nor title pride  
Could e’er my guarded bosom move  
To yield its citadel to love.  
But candour, fairest flow’r of youth!  
Wit, ever-smiling Wisdom’s guest!  
The vow, the eloquence of Truth  
Warm from an unpolluted breast  
These might a weeping Widow move  
To meet again — a husband’s love.

A very pretty hint, but Mrs Bustleton says Lord Aircastle is 45 therefore the 7th line is not appropriate. I must keep it for another purchaser.
