Pity shew, ye English Fair, revealing  
Where is my Henry’s blest abode;  
Soon you’ll find in vain is all concealing,  
For love to him shall point the road.  
Heart be still, nor throb to breaking,  
While my English Love I’m seeking!

If ye ask a token of my Lover,  
He’s known by valour, sense and truth,  
Eyes of blue and locks of brown discover  
The flow’r of your fair Island’s youth.  
Heart be still, nor throb to breaking,  
While my English Love I’m seeking!

In the plains of dear Estemadura  
How happy Julia was to roam,  
Or to sport beneath thy groves, Evora,  
Till duty call’d my Henry home!  
Heart be still, nor throb to breaking,  
While my English Love I’m seeking!

Without him for Julia glow’d no pleasure  
’Mid Lusitania’s Lords or Dames,  
And I wand’ring seek my heart’s dear treasure  
Along the winding banks of Thames.  
Heart be still, nor throb to breaking,  
While my English Love I’m seeking!
