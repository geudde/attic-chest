### Prize Essay

On the shores of Green Erin the wanderer had strayed,  
&emsp;Till the Sun was declining, the heavens were all red,  
&emsp;No hamlet was near to afford him a bed,  
So down <span data-tippy="the soft turf" class="green">a hillock</span> to slumber he laid.  
Oh! fair was the evening; each Zephyr was balm  
&emsp;&emsp;The billows were calm  
And perched on the oak which o’ershadow’d his head  
&emsp;Sweet Philomel warbled to <span data-tippy="Cynthia" class="green">Luna</span> her strain  
Till she sunk in the waves, and the darkness was fled  
&emsp;And the Lark’s lyric carols awaked him again.

The skies are all dappled with purple and gold  
&emsp;Each flower raised its head that at eve was reclined  
&emsp;But the freshness of morning still breathed in the wind  
And a thick fleecy mist o’er the ocean was rolled.  
But as Phoebus ascended, it melted away  
&emsp;&emsp;Like the frost in his ray,  
And the coast was discover’d all rocky around;  
&emsp;From the darkness that veil’d it, each object is free  
From the Isle of old Rathlin, for mutton renowned  
&emsp;To the loose-hanging bridge of high Carric-a-Rede

“But what is that island so fresh and so fair!  
&emsp;Oh! see like an emerald, all sparkling and bright  
&emsp;It floats in an ocean of violet light  
And fragrance unwonted is borne on the air!  
How green are its fields! How umbrageous its bowers!  
&emsp;&emsp;What curtains of flowers  
Are drawn round each cottage so airy and white!  
&emsp;How dark are yon woods! How majestic their shade!  
Yon rocks how romantic! How towering their height!  
&emsp;In verdure now soft is that valley array’d!  

“When the sun sunk in ocean, that isle was not there!  
&emsp;What wondrous enchantment has wafted it here?  
&emsp;And oh! by yon river so sparkling and clear  
Oh! who are yon damsels so sportive and fair?”  
He sprung to his boat that was moor’d on the shore,  
&emsp;&emsp;While the dash of his oar  
Reverberates low from the rock all around,
&emsp;And near and more near as he rows to the bay  
A joy more complete in his bosom he found,  
&emsp;The island grew lovelier, the morning more gay.

And see on the shore the sweet maidens who stand!  
&emsp;Their vesture is gay as the arch of the sky  
&emsp;And Heaven’s deepest azure is bright in their eye.  
A branch of green myrtle is borne in each hand  
and the sound of their song, the young hunter to hail  
&emsp;&emsp;Is borne on the gale.  
“Oh! who is the mortal, who thus can presume  
&emsp;To view the green vales of the Fairies’ loved isle?  
Yet come to our dwellings, brave wanderer come!  
&emsp;And fear not, our bosoms are strangers to guile.  

“We have spells that would tarnish the light of the sun  
&emsp;And spread a white mist o’er the ocean again.  
&emsp;We can dye the pale moon with a crimson stain  
And bid the full rivers more tardily run  
We urge the fleet tempest more loud and more fast  
&emsp;&emsp;We stay the rude blast  
And loose on the deck flaps the swelling sail  
&emsp;When the ocean roars loudest we bid it be still  
At our mandate it rises unswept by a gale,  
&emsp;For the sea and the air are the slaves of our will.  

“On the flashes of lightning we ride thro’ the sky  
&emsp;We gleam faint on the helm in the steersman’s view  
&emsp;And of shipwreck and death tell the shuddering crew  
And we guide the red meteors that gambol on high.  
Or deep in the bog, on a starless night  
&emsp;&emsp;Lead the toil weary wight  
Yet let not thy bosom be saddened by fear  
&emsp;Nor turn thy light skiff form the Fairies’ bay  
For none but the good can find anchorage here  
&emsp;Whom we hail as a friend we will cherish for aye.

Where the ears are more rich, and the zephyrs more bland  
&emsp;Where the udders are fullest, the pastures more green  
&emsp;Where the weeds shun the soil, and the skies are serene  
’Tis a friend of the Fairies who tenants the land.  
As it flies o’er his dwelling, the tempest is calm  
&emsp;&emsp;E’en the blight scatters balm.  
No shower shall be sparing to swell the young shoot,  
&emsp;No sun shall be wanting to ripen the grain  
No mildew shall blast it, no worm eat the root,  
&emsp;No tempest shall deluge the harvest with rain.

“While seven times the sun shall the seasons renew  
&emsp;Concealed in the ocean this island must lie  
&emsp;Reveal’d but a day to the light of the sky  
To the breeze of the morning, the evening’s chill dew.  
Yet mild are the winters, and gay are the flowers  
&emsp;&emsp;In our submarine bowers,  
For our necks we have coral, and pearls for our hair,  
&emsp;We have insects that shine in our grottoes by night  
The moon thro’ the wave seems more placid and fair  
&emsp;And soft is the hue of our emerald light.  

And blest is the eye that beholds us arise  
&emsp;And blest is the foot that shall tread on our strand  
&emsp;Oh blest is he yield to remain on our land  
Or if to the dwellings of mortals he hies.  
Then mount this rich chariot,’tis sent by our Queen  
&emsp;&emsp;With emeralds so green  
The wheels are all studded, with rubies the rein,  
&emsp;The whip is of diamond, of silk is its thong  
From the eider duck’s bosom your cushion was ta’en  
&emsp;And four steeds, snowy white, drag the burthen along.

He delays not, but swift to the chariot he sprung,  
&emsp;And light o’er the hill and the valley they bound,  
&emsp;While on earth or in air as they gambol around  
The damsels more sweet than the nightingale sung.  
O’er a lawn smoothly shaven the chariot has roll’d  
&emsp;&emsp;The wheels of pure gold  
Now stop at the Palace — what wonders are there!  
&emsp;How surpassing the works raised by man’s feeble hand  
Can aught upon Earth with this dwelling compare?  
&emsp;So strangely constructed, so artfully plann’d.

Of flowers the rich pavement’s mosaic was laid,  
&emsp;Of flowers was the cornice, of flowers was the roof  
&emsp;Of flowers were the columns that bore it aloof  
And of flowers the rich seats and the cushions were spread  
How lively their colours, how fresh is their bloom  
&emsp;&emsp;How rich their perfume  
They breathe a soft charm thro’ the ravished soul  
&emsp;Pain, sorrow, nor sickness can trouble it here  
Oh! the warrior might yield to their magic control  
&emsp;And cover with roses his sword and his spear.

But how gazed the youth as he entered the hall  
&emsp;Oh what ravishing music from minstrels unseen  
&emsp;And see that bright circle surrounding their Queen  
Their locks were all golden, their stature was small  
The lily’s soft satin, or velvet of rose  
&emsp;&emsp;Their vesture compose  
A rich emerald wand was upreared in each hand  
&emsp;And swift thro’ the dance’s light mazes they move  
Now archness lurk’d sly, in each fire-darting eye  
&emsp;Now their languishing looks breathed the softness of love.  

The Queen has received him with kindness and grace  
&emsp;She has thrown o’er his shoulders of manly mould  
&emsp;A mantle embroidered of purple and gold  
And honour’d the youth with a courteous embrace  
While a thousand soft voices are warbling around  
&emsp;&emsp;His welcome to sound  
For him she selects her most delicate fare  
&emsp;She calls him to sit on her emerald car  
And she bids her most beautiful damsels prepare  
&emsp;To follow their Queen to the sylvan war.

With arrows and lances they rush to the chase  
&emsp;Green housings of satin o’erspread the white hind,  
&emsp;And her neck a rich collar of jewels confined  
And she bounded and stretched her fleet limbs to the race  
They pursue over mountain, o’er river and vale  
&emsp;&emsp;More swift then the gale  
But just as the dogs should have drunk her red blood  
&emsp;From their grasp and their sight she has vanish’d away  
The hounds and the hunters no longer pursu’d  
&emsp;But return to the court at the call of the fay.  

And now to the palace the hunters return  
&emsp;At the feast by the Sovereign the stranger reclines  
&emsp;And nectar more rich than the Earth’s choicest wines  
Is pour’d by her slaves from a diamond urn.  
The banquet is over, she turn’d to her guest,  
&emsp;&emsp;“The sun in the west,  
Is already declining, brave wanderer stay  
&emsp;Or wilt thou return to the land of thy birth.  

“I proffer thee all I can give with my hand  
&emsp;Oh wilt thou be render’d immortal by me!  
&emsp;To roam by my side o’er the caves of the sea  
To recline on my breast, and my subjects command.  
Consent and this hall with the plaudits shall ring  
&emsp;&emsp;That salute the King —   
Yet speak! not a word, not a glance shall reprove  
&emsp;If thou shun’st my attractions, and fliest from my power  
No vengeance shall follow the slight of my love  
&emsp;And the grief of a fairy endures but an hour.”

“Oh Lady! if beauty my bosom could sway  
&emsp;Oh where is there mortal so lovely as thou!  
&emsp;If wealth or ambition had power on me now  
If my heart were unshackled, how blest could I stay!  
But oh! there is one, ’tis a delicate flower  
&emsp;&emsp;Who droops in her bower.  
The maid who in grief look’d for comfort from me  
&emsp;Can I crush her fond hopes, can I bid her despair!  
Then say not, dear Lady, ’tis flying from thee  
&emsp;If I will not be false to a maiden less fair!”  

He beheld a soft tear in the Fairy’s blue eye  
&emsp;And he saw the deep sorrow that rose in her breast  
&emsp;But her pride and her promise her feelings repressed  
And a smile of beneficence followed her sigh.  
“May the Heaven’s richest dews on thy orchards descend  
&emsp;&emsp;May their full branches bend  
With the weight of their wealth; and the maid of thy love  
&emsp;Be true as the needle that points to the pole!  
No sorrow, no sickness, thy bosom shall prove  
&emsp;And the years of thy rapture as moments shall roll.  

“But yet ’tis not thus I must lose thee!” she said,  
&emsp;“With me the gay dance thou wilt hardly decline  
&emsp;Yon pale sickly moon let our tapers outshine.”  
While her accents yet vibrate, her voice was obeyed,  
And a thousand bright lamps in the high chamber shone  
&emsp;&emsp;The tables were gone  
And the fairies like garlands of blossoms advance  
&emsp;To the minstrel’s soft harp and the maiden’s gay song  
Still farther and farther they urge the blithe dance  
&emsp;And still would their Queen the dear moments prolong.

The first flush of morning was seen in the sky  
&emsp;When e’en with the fullness of pleasure oppressed  
&emsp;On a couch of fresh roses the youth sunk to rest.  
He woke, and the Sun was already on high  
Yet still a white mist o’er the ocean was spread  
&emsp;&emsp;And as slowly it fled  
Old Donegal’s rocks all around were confessed  
&emsp;The Island was gone, not a token remained  
Save a rose that the Lady had placed in his breast  
&emsp;Save the fragrance that still his rich mantle retained.
