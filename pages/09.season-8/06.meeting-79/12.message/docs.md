The Contributor of the Modinhas is much flattered by the reception they have met with from the Attic Society, and he would sooner have attended to the wish expressed for the Music, had not the only copy he possesses been marked with the initials of the authors, which would have made a premature disclosure and had he been able to spare the time required to make another copy: as however the present number is the last, he is now willing to lend the above-mentioned book whenever the Editress may wish it, but he regrets that circumstances, which may be hereafter explained, prevent him from presenting a copy of the Music, or from permitting any transcript of it to be made at present.
