Since from my William fate will me sever,  
Heart’s best affections follow him ever!  
Tho’ eyes exchange not kindred emotion,  
Thoughts need no passport to fly o’er the ocean;  
So shall not distance true Lovers sever;  
Heart’s best affections follow him ever!

Fond thoughts and wishes, fly to my Lover!  
Round him in visions of sympathy hover,  
Gently of Laura and love to remind him,  
Trackless for you, no path that can find him.  
No time nor distance true souls can sever —   
Heart’s best affections follow him ever!
