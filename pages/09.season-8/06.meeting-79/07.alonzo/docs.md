Slowly wained the moon’s pale lustre,  
&emsp;Faintly blushed the rising morn,  
As Alonzo groaned in anguish  
&emsp;Under proud Estalla’s scorn.  
At her lattice long he’d waited,  
With no kindly word was greeted,  
“I was loved, but now I’m hated!”  
&emsp;He at length indignant cried —   
&emsp;“Would that in the fight I’d died!  
Oh would that I in fight had died!”

2

Hapless was Alonzo’s fortune!  
&emsp;In fierce duel late he’d slain  
A young knight of birth and merit,  
&emsp;And he now must flee from Spain:  
Slighted love augments his anguish,  
But no more he’ll pine and languish,  
Ev’ry home-bred tie he’ll vanquish —   
&emsp;Flies to Tunis in despair —   
&emsp;And he roams a wild Corsair,  
Oh he roams a wild Corsair!

Long Estella mourned her Lover;  
&emsp;Cold her mien, but warm her heart;  
And she won the Royal favor  
&emsp;His free pardon to impart.  
Yet with fruitless care she sought him,  
No returning vessel brought him,  
Dead at last Estella thought him;  
&emsp;And she cried, in wild despair,  
&emsp;“Maids of ill-placed scorn beware!  
Oh still of ill-placed scorn beware!”

Softly falls a soothing murmur,  
&emsp;As the surges almost sleep,  
Where the Guadalaviar’s waters  
&emsp;Haste to mingle with the deep:  
Then Estella’s sadly roaming,  
Lost Alonzo’s fate bemoaning,  
When a cry “The Moors are coming!”  
&emsp;Roused her, direst fate to brave,  
&emsp;For no arms was there to save,  
And they bore her o’er the wave!

5

Swift to Tunis sped the Pirates,  
&emsp;There to sell their matchless prize —   
But how rose Estella’s wonder  
&emsp;At the scene that met her eyes;  
For a Turk of noblest seeming,  
Eyes with sudden rapture beaming,  
Tears adown his visage streaming,  
&emsp;Started from his shady seat —   
&emsp;Trembling rushed her steps to meet —   
And humbly cast him at her feet!

6

Thus Alonzo and Estella  
&emsp;Wond’ring meet on barb’rous ground;  
Soon, forgiving and forgiven,  
&emsp;All their woes in joy were drown’d.  
Home he speeds, his best Love near him;  
Hopes of bliss now shine to cheer him,  
&emsp;For in undissolving bands  
&emsp;Soon shall join their plighted hands —   
Join their hearts and join their hands.
