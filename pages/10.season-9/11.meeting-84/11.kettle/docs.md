O Kettle! ’tis a piteous sight to see  
Thy silver cheeks disfigur’d by the coals  
While thro’ thy lips the murm’ring vapour rolls  
And all sit at their ease — save thou and me!  
Yet breathing bland and dulcet melody  
Thou sittest still — but O! — Alas! — the more  
Thy voice is heard, the sooner is thy store  
Of water wasted ere we drink our tea!  
Sweet singing Kettle! — while I gaze on thee  
I think how like the liquid element  
Love when it boils too fast, is quickly spent  
And ends in smoke and drear vacuity —   
Too oft like thee, bright tea-kettle of tin,  
All gloss without, all emptiness within!
