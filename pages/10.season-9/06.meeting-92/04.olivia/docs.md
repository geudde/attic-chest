<span class="title">The First and Last</span>

I lov’d thee — how, no tongue can tell —   
&emsp;I love thee — all may question why;  
But Reason, when they mock the spell,  
&emsp;Gives to the scorners brief reply.  
It was because thy gentle pow’r  
&emsp;My fancy’s earliest blossom nursed;  
Thine was my childhood’s sweetest hour  
&emsp;And thine the love that warm’d it first.  
Thou wast the eyelid of my soul —   
&emsp;Preserver of its purest sense;  
And once beneath thy bland control  
&emsp;It slept in holy innocence.  
Oft to the brink of Ruin’s flood  
&emsp;Thou cam’st a wand’rer to arrest,  
And like the guardian mother, show’d  
&emsp;The softness of a matron’s breast.  
I gave thee first a tale of Time [^1]  
&emsp;Which withers Pleasure’s summer roses  
Now take a tale of love like mine  
&emsp;Which on the wings of Time reposes.  
For Time and Love together grew  
&emsp;First in Creation’s volume class’d;  
And ancient Time where’er he flew,  
&emsp;Found faithful Love surviving last.  
The flow’rs of pomp, and fame, and wit  
&emsp;Have left this hollow bosome bare;  
But one long-hid remembrance yet  
&emsp;Lives like the dark soft violet there.

It is the last! without a sigh    
&emsp;None look on loves or friendships past.  
None smile without a tearful eye  
&emsp;When Joy’s bright moment is the last.  
Think of me when in distant lands  
&emsp;Perhaps thy wreath of fame is cast;  
Think of me — from thy minstrel’s hands  
&emsp;This gift is sacred — ’tis the last!  

Dearer than pleasure’s summer glow  
&emsp;When rosy footed hours glide fast,  
Is that brief word which faint and slow  
&emsp;Unwilling Friendship whispers last —   

**Farewell!** When jealous Time shall touch  
&emsp;Thy bloom with Winter’s withering blast,  
Such be thy friendships — only such  
&emsp;Gild the bright hour and soothe the **Last**.
