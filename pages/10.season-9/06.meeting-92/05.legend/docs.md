<span class="title">The Last Legend</span>

Lord Patrick from his home lies far  
And the death-bird screams over old Dunbar;  
His hound has forgotten his native land  
His war-horse stoops to another hand;  
No traveller treads that lonely way  
But the Palmer from Cheviot’s mountain grey.  
And that pale musing wand’rer sighs  
With blighted cheek and hollow eyes  
&emsp;As on his pilgrim-staff reposed,  
He leans beside the church-yard bound  
Gazing on many a mossy mound  
&emsp;O’er gentle hearts for ever clos’d.  
He loves upon that turf to rest  
Yet there is in his lonely breast  
No relic of love-hallow’d days,  
Such as in sweet remembrance stays  
Like autumn-flow’rs that softly breathe  
Tho’ time has shrunk the rosy wreath.  
The fountain of his joy is dried  
And the rich channel it supplied  
Is now a chasm dark and deep  
Where weeds and baleful serpents creep.  

A mourner sits in the roofless aisle  
Of old Dunbar’s forsaken pile,  
Where, stretch’d upon his shield of pride  
A warrior’s form lies sanctified  
With uprais’d palms together prest,  
Signing his hope of holy rest.

“Lady!” the Palmer said and frown’d,  
“Thy locks are smooth and jet-black yet,  
Thine eyes for lovers’ lamps are fit  
Why sitt’st thou on this lonely mound?”  
On that fair lady’s face awhile  
Dwelt such a chill and changeless smile  
As parts the pale lips of the dead  
When life, but not its look, is fled.  
“I have seen royal banners bow’d —   
And now the wild fox hides her young  
Where noble Patrick’s trophies hung  
While wine-cups cheer’d his vassal croud.  
But, Palmer, thou has hoary hair,  
And many a year of brooding care  
Has sunk thy cheek and dimm’d thine eye;  
Tell then if ought beneath the sky  
Is happiness which man may share!”  

Lowly the Palmer bent his knee—  
“Thy thoughts are earthly things above;  
Yet happiness on earth may be  
And ag’d men teach the mystery—  
It has the eye and voice of Love,  
But walks and dwells with Charity.    
For Charity from mortal sight  
Retires its busy glance to shun;  
She walks in shadow, but has light  
From him whose eye is in the Sun.  
She loves the valley, and her rest  
Is the gentle heart’s recess —   
And once — when man was Eden’s guest,  
He knew, and call’d her *Happiness*.”—  

Smiling, the Lady stoop’d to fill  
Her maple cup at Deva’s rill —    
“Palmer!” — she cried — “the widow’s cruse  
Yields not the spicy purple juice,  
Yet take this draught—a boon so small  
She weeps to give, but gives thee all.”  
Softly she smiled, and meekly spoke.   
Why shook the Palmer as he quaff’d  
From hands so fair the gentle draught  
With lifted eye and loosen’d cloak  
Back from his shining armour thrown?  
The red light of the fading west  
Seem’d on his shrivell’d brow to rest  
Like glory on a broken throne.  
“Fair Agnes! thou hast taught me well  
How happiness on earth may dwell;  
&emsp;It is when bending by the grave  
Of him who stung my trusting heart,  
And rent away its dearest part,  
I learn to bless, forgive, and save!  
“Thou know’st me now! but never yet  
Did hate the cup of peace repay —   
A dagger’s hilt would ill befit  
The hand which thus on thine I lay.    
Thy husband wrong’d me—I am he  
Whose vengeance laid thy banners low  
But never to a nobler foe  
Did holy earth give sepulchre;  
And thus upon his pardon’d head  
Balm from thy bounteous cup I shed;  
Thus with the drops thy pity gave  
I consecrate thy warrior’s grave.  
Lady! yon pale round moon shall wane,  
Ere with his pilgrim-staff again  
A palmer at thy gate shall stand;  
Then fill the goblet to the brim  
The taper and the hearth-fire trim —   
Thy boon may bless a monarch’s hand!  
Turn, mourner, to thy home, and prove  
Kings vanquish noble foes by love.”   

Ere the new moon’s silver horn was bow’d  
Fair Agnes sat in her castle proud:  
High in her hall a goblet shone  
Of the onyx pale and purple stone  
And its base was a gem so pure and bright  
It seem’d an orb of golden light.  
The heart-worn pilgrim’s sorrows sank  
Whene’r of that precious cup he drank  
But none its balmy pow’r can prove  
None can its magic lustre see  
Till his eye and tongue are true to love,  
And his hand and heart to Charity.
