<span class="title">By her forsaken admirer</span>

I start upon no search grotesque  
Of humour or the picturesque  
But on my plighted Lady’s flight  
Dash boldly as a loyal knight  
Thro’ flood and fire to find her track  
To quell her foes and bring her back.  
Nor wonder, since the Muse can stray,  
If mine should be a rambling lay:  
I late to show how much I prized her  
In attic circles advertized her,  
And finding that attempt in vain  
Start on my pilgrimage of pain.  
My cheek is lean, my frown is spare  
And ink has dyed my flaxen hair,  
While my slack eye may well discover  
The grief of a forsaken lover.  
An inkhorn and a pen are seen  
Embroidered on my pelerine,  
And to supply the pilgim’s wand  
A role of paper arms my hand.

Alas! I find, as Quixote found  
Castles are levelled to the ground  
While inns, and dear ones too, abound  
So, for I scorn all false pretences  
I’ll print my <span data-tippy="illegible" class="red">[???]</span> to pay expenses  
The Muse — oh how shall I declare  
Her form or features — eyes or hair —   
My heart, my head, her fire has warmed  
Her siren voice my ear has charm’d,  
I’ve been her lover many a year  
And always seem’d to feel her near,  
While still her magic presence gave  
New lustre to the dancing wave,  
A deeper azure to the sky,  
The velvet lawn a greener dye,  
And bade the nightingale complain  
To brighter moon, in softer strain;  
Nay if with her I dared to trace  
Some youthful beauty’s roseate face,  
No envy chilled her soul — but she  
Lent each soft feature symmetry,  
While sense and virtue seem to lie  
In the blue heaven of every eye.

Whene’er a tuneful tale I’ve plann’d  
I’ve felt her guide my trembling hand,  
Etherial raptures filled me then  
And halos danced around my pen  
Till my fond soul would quite forget  
These eyes have never seen her yet.  
And if I ask her form, I find  
Each paints some image of his mind;  
One draws her cross and old and lean,  
One fair as youth’s delightful queen,  
One with a mien reserved and high,  
One with a bright and laughing eye,  
Yet all — if you’ll believe — pretend  
She’s been their long and constant friend.  

Thus in the dark, without a choice  
I seek her by her angel voice  
And mounted upon Fancy’s steed  
A creature of no common breed  
But blending every semblance vain  
That thought can raise, or poet feign  
I fly — like falling meteors over  
The paltry herring pond at Dover.  
Nor pause, till now he sets me down  
In Paris, that enchanted town.  
Oh! ’twas a happy thought, no doubt  
I here shall quickly find her out;  
In Senates, in their Public Places  
They talk of Muses and of Graces,  
And Rome’s discarded Gods ’tis clear  
Have taken summer lodging here.  
Besides — oh faithless and disloyal!  
I lost her in the Palais Royal  
And yet to me it seems most plain  
I shall not find her there again.

Oh Paris! thou whose every part  
Was beauty to my raptured heart  
When with my Muse I viewed thee, now  
How dirty mean and wretched thou —   
Ye sons of gain, who pace away  
Your round-head orange groves each day,  
Be wise and take them to the shops  
For Paris is in want of mops.  
No more mine eye delighted roves  
The Luxembourg’s befrizzled groves,  
Or where beside the Tuileries planted  
A thousand Dames like Dames enchanted,  
Meagre and shivering, white-washed, lone,  
Catch cold on pedestals of stone.

I’ve sought her at Nicola’s, where round  
His tables, each with viands crown’d  
Seven smirking Damsels, in a line,  
Profess themselves the Muses nine,  
And great Apollo in the middle  
Improves the banquet with his fiddle.  
The bright Italian café drew  
My steps, and might have drawn hers too;  
Gay was the music, bright the glare,  
And hundreds took their ices there;  
But she was absent, nor was gone  
To swell the crowded Mille Colonnes  
Nor where some watchmen’s lanterns lighted  
To gloomy Tivoli invited,  
Nor where the tapes glare illumes  
With livelier light, the Catacombs,  
Nor at the vaunted Drama, where  
Was one a stiff affected fair  
Who claims and bears a Muses’s name,  
But how unlike my vanquish’d Dame;  
Nor is she one of those who choose  
To venture down the Montagnes Russes  
(Of old Leucate poets tell  
This flying leap might serve as well)  
Where Gallic delegates assemble  
To make the states of Europe tremble,  
I thought, since females were allow’d,  
That she might herd among the crowd;  
I sought her at the Observatory  
And reached with pain its twentieth story  
But on a poet’s faith, declare  
Her steps could ne’er have wandered there;  
Its vacant halls, at cost profuse  
Were built for show, and not for use —   

Seeks thee the Institute? oh no!  
There science reigns, and well we know  
That still the haughty Dame refuses  
All friendship with her Sister Muses.

Alas! thro’ Paris I have sought her,  
And often thought I’d nearly caught her,  
But when her name is bruited most  
I find she’s farthest — to my cost.  
And since (for nothing can be plainer)  
That neither France nor Spain contain her,  
Nor Italy, in antient times  
Beloved — but left for happier climes —   
Nor Belgium, where her soul might thrill  
At the bare mention of a hill,  
But vainly stretch her eager eye  
To catch the blest reality,  
Since not out loftiest poets drew  
Her transient gaze at Waterloo,  
But pitiless, she left them all,  
Unhonor’d on its plains to fall;  
In foreign climes no more I’ll fret,  
Perchance she lurks in London yet,  
(The place young Watson can attest  
Where guilt and treason shroud them best)  
If you have burst your prison’s bar  
And wish for safety, fly not far,  
Close by its walls your den prepare  
Secure that none will seek you there.

Hail happy England! oh once more  
With what delight I tread thy shore.  
Avaunt then uncouth <span data-tippy="illegible" class="red">[???]</span> strains  
A rhyme to loose my soul disdains,  
Such novel warmth my fancy fires  
Methinks the Muse again inspires,  
Let her where’er she chooses roam,  
I quit no more my country’s home.

Oh England! if there be some happier clime  
With fields more fair and mountains more sublime,  
Where softer breezes breathe, and happier toil  
Wins richer harvests from the fertile soil,  
Where famine never scowls in writer’s brain,  
Nor whirlwinds rage, or earthquakes shake the plain,  
Where no volcanoes flame, nor baleful breath  
Of sultry summer breeds disease and death —   
Oh! if on Earth such happy spot be found  
With endless spring, with brightest verdure crown’d,  
What should I gain — if Man’s uncultured mind  
Should prove more niggard in a soil more kind,  
And dearth and misery — vice, disease and care  
And passion’s whirlwinds make their dwelling there.  
Oh! England oh my country, give me still  
Each smooth green plain, each gently swelling hill,  
Each flowery hedgerow, each sequestered glade,  
Each murmuring brook, each grove’s time-honored shade;  
Aspiring domes and marble halls I scorn,  
Be mine the *home* that art and taste adorn —   
For oh! there is no country shows like thee  
Attempered rule and legal liberty,  
So bright in useful beauty — or so rife  
In ale the social elegance of life.  
Here if no wonders lure the stranger’s sight,  
No splendors dazzle and no spells invite,  
All knows its place, smooth equable and just  
No danger threaten, and no wants disgust.

Yes! ’twas the Muse, but she is gone,  
And like a drowning rat alone  
My bridge of straw disjointed quite  
She leaves me all adrift in spite.  
I thought, I felt, I thought I sung  
Ah no! it was her sweeter tongue  
And, just as I had turn’d to watch her,  
Some demon from my sight must snatch her.  
Roland, Charlemagne — heroic breed  
Your patience and your strength I need,  
Alas! again she’s snatched away,  
And I’ve a Dover bill to pay.
