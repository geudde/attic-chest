**C**&hairsp;old is the heart that late so gaily beat,  
**H**&hairsp;ow pale that face, where smiles once beam’d so sweet,  
**A**&hairsp;las! and is thy infant spirit fled!  
**R**&hairsp;eturn’d to God? Then mourn not for the dead;  
**L**&hairsp;ife here below is but a waking dream.  
**O**&hairsp;ur longest years a little moment seem,  
**T**&hairsp;oday alone is ours — Tomorrow, Ah!  
**T**&hairsp;omorrow, who presumes to call his own?  
**E**&hairsp;ternal God! We bow before thy Throne.
