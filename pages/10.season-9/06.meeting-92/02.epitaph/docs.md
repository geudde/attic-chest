Four years, upon a mountain’s brow,  
And Hermit lived — the Lord knows how.   
A robe of sackcloth he did wear,  
And got his food — the Lord knows where.   
Hardships and penance were his lot,  
He often prayed — the Lord knows what.  
At last, this holy man did die.  
He left the world; the Lord knows why!  
He’s buried in this gloomy den,  
And he shall rise — the Lord knows when!
