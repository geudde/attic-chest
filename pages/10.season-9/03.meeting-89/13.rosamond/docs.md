The annexed description (selected from a work which will soon meet the public eye) of a Chest once sacred to Beauty, cannot be more honourably deposited than in the Chest now consecrated to Genius.

A wondrous chest it was of fashion fair,  
Rare the materials, but the work more rare:  
The body of some unknown metal seem’d  
And o’er its dusky hue a lustre gleam’d:  
A silver moulding bent the base around  
Enamel’d o’er to imitate the ground —  
Figures it bore with habit, form and face  
Of every clime that bears a human race  
And towers of men were there, and mimic seas  
And ships that seem’d to wait the slumbering breeze.  
Before the whole transpicuous crystal rose  
At once to guard the wonders and disclose.  
In front the roof of blue and shining steel  
Bore with strange characters emboss’d, a seal;  
Beneath its broad projecting edge to hold  
Four damsels stood of pure and massive gold;  
Stern beauty and severe each face express’d  
And every hand was cross’d on ev’ry breast:  
Above of fretted gold a hollow cone  
Rose from the centre of the cover thrown;  
Of gold a gryphon stood on either side  
With threat’ning beak and wings extended wide —  

Far in the wilds of Afric died the sage  
Who risk’d for this his being’s heritage.  
No mortal hands e’er labour’d in the mine  
That furnish’d forth these metals’ azure shine;  
Strange fuel gave the stubborn mass the heat  
That brought it ductile to the forge’s beat  
And the parch’d rocks, from haunts of man remote,  
Groan’d as cursed hands upon the anvil smote.
Man may not hear (and live) the words of pow’r  
That bound the workers in that fearful hour  
And when their task was done arose a spell  
About the work, that mortal may not tell —  
A sweet yet pungent fume diffus’d around  
The senses with its powerful odour drown’d  
Thrill’d thro’ the brain, o’er ev’ry fibre spread,  
And o’er the soul a soft delirium shed.  
Now mimic lightnings flash’d and from the cone  
With meteor brightness rosy globes were thrown  
And brilliant stars and flames of scarlet hue  
That chang’d to purple, violet and blue  
Then cours’d the bright prismatic order thro’  
At length came forth a pale and steady light  
Soft as the moon and as serenely bright.  
Next rose and seem’d to swim in air around  
A low and sweetly undulating sound,  
Far off now floating, now returning near  
And gently swelling on the charmed ear;  
Then melodies ascended, varying oft  
Plaintive, and low, and sweet, and wild and soft  
Plaintive as requiems chanted o’er the dead  
Or songs of breasts that every hope has fled:  
Soft as the sigh coy Beauty breathes aside  
When melting love contends with maiden pride  
Or the bland airs, that thick with sweets of spring,  
Scarce wake the sensitive Eolian string:  
Sweet as the soft, half-smother’d, gurgling note  
Heard when the nightingale prepares her throat:  
When ere she puts forth all her strength again  
She modulates a low prelusive strain:  
Wild as the wildest ditty mermaids sing  
When on a rock their sea-green hair they wring;  
Now one by one their souls in music spending  
Now in full harmony their voices blending  
In ev’ry skirmish of sweet sound contending —
