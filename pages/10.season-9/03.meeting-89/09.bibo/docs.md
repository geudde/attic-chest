&emsp;Oh “Baume de Vie” by me possessed,  
&emsp;Of all liqueurs the first and best,  
&emsp;&emsp;In thee my sovereign joy is sure!  
&emsp;Each friendly voice  
&emsp;Shall bless my choice —  
&emsp;&emsp;There’s nothing like “Parfait Amour!”

If hearts o’erbalanc’d by despair  
Are shipwreck’d in the sea of care,  
Thy soft intoxicating fervours  
Are worth a thousand life-preservers.  
&emsp;Oh “Baume de Vie” by me possessed,  
&emsp;Of all liqueurs the first and best,  
&emsp;&emsp;In thee my sovereign joy is sure!  
&emsp;In sorrow all  
&emsp;On thee shall call —   
&emsp;&emsp;O! there’s nothing like “Parfait Amour!”

When favourable fortune sheds  
Her countless flow’rs around our heads,  
The choicest gifts she yields our souls  
Are groaning boards and flowing bowls —  
&emsp;Oh “Baume de Vie” by me possessed,  
&emsp;Dearest of all liqueurs and best,  
&emsp;&emsp;In thee my sovereign joy is sure!  
&emsp;In blissful hours  
&emsp;All own thy powers —   
&emsp;&emsp;O! there’s nothing like Parfait Amour!
