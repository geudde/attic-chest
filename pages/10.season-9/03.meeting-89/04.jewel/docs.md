<span class="title">Lines written in the drawers of a lady’s cabinet to hold jewels, presented her by a young friend.</span>


No. 1

The golden Chain not firmer links impart  
Than Friendship fixes on the grateful heart.

No. 2

The sparkling Diamond not more fire displays  
Than Anna’s Wit, that to the ear conveys  
Instruction which ne’er pleases less  
Array’d in Gaiety’s enchanting dress.

No. 3

Dear Lady, in the Pearl you’ll find  
The semblance of the Giver’s mind  
Fair emblem of unsullied truth  
Of Innocence, of guileless Youth

The Ring Drawer

Lady! may your days be found  
Emblems of the eternal round,  
Still unbroken, undefaced,  
But frequent by some gem be graced,  
The varying Opal, or the Brilliant rare,  
The classic Pegasus, that soars in air;  
The Victory, that speaks your power  
O’er him, who in a happy hour  
Claim’d your not unwilling hand,  
That Ring, the Chief o’er all the rest  
Most powerful, most loved, and best!

The Lost Muse
