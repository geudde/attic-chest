<span class="title">A Persian Legend</span>

The moon of Nauruz silvers yet  
Spahaun’s high tow’r and minaret;  
Eight times the golden bowl has pour’d  
Red nectar on the banquet’s board  
And nymphs with purple feet have wav’d  
Their locks in myrrh and amber lav’d.  
Lah Illah! — thrice the holy song  
Has rung Shah Sephi’s bow’rs among —   
He sleeps on woven down reclin’d,  
While bathed in balm, the saffron rose  
Beneath his perfum’d pillow glows  
With Shirauz’ silver clusters twin’d.  
Soft sounds his slumb’ring ear surprise!  
A form in youthful beauty bright  
Comes like the dream of new delight  
Seen by the love-warm’d poet’s eyes.  
Such forms their gracious vigils keep  
When rose-lipp’d Houris whisper sleep.

“Whence and what art thou, form divine?”  
“I was, I am, and shall have been!  
A dim unearthly shape is mine  
Falsely thro’ painted shadows seen!  
I was the Future! — I have slept  
Unknown since Time himself was born  
When on the Sun’s first glorious morn  
Prophetic Allah paus’d and wept;  
He saw me in the depths afar  
Of dark and drear Eternity;  
And ere he shap’d the earliest star  
His changeless mission gave to me.  
No longer veil’d, no longer dumb,  
I visit thy desiring eyes  
From the wide throng of things to come  
Where Happiness for ever lies!  
Sought but unseen! I haste to bring  
New treasures from the lap of Fate,  
Yet thou wilt ask another spring  
To open Joy’s still distant gate!  
I am the Present! now I lift  
The veil, which hid my shining brow:  
That precious veil was Wisdom’s gift  
Tho’ cluster’d roses crown me now.  
Thou hear’st not while on flow’rs I tread  
How swift my down-shod feet are gone!  
Thou sees my silver pinions spread  
Forgetful how they waft me on!  
Tomorrow, silent, sad, and cold  
I join the throng of ages past;  
And none shall find the threads of gold  
Wove in the veil by Fancy cast  
O’er dim unshap’d Futurity  
When Youth and Pleasure smil’d for thee!  
Age, weeping Age shall strive in vain  
To weave that precious veil again!  
I go, and those who watch my track  
Thy glories and they pomp shall praise;  
But thou unheard shall call me back  
Again on vanished joys to gaze:  
Thy scimitar may ’grave my name  
On earth on adamant or brass  
In vain! thy tow’rs of wealth and fame  
To darkness with thyself shall pass:  
Alike thy sceptre and thy tomb  
Shall moulder in oblivion’s gloom.   
But on a tablet never traced  
By mortal eye or mortal hand,  
Thy deeds are graven undefaced  
Till by rewarding Allah scann’d:  
He in the fading rainbow writes  
The record of Man’s brief delights  
But in the blest eternal Sun  
Preserves the fame by Virtue won. 

Farewell! the fated hour is near  
When I and all the Past shall rise  
Before assembled myriads eyes,  
The fiat of our Judge to hear:  
Truth shall unveil his throne, and Men  
Who fear Him now, shall know him **then**!
