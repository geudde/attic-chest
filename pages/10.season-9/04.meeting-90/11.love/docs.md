What affords Life’s choicest blessing?  
What’s the good best worth possessing  
&emsp;&emsp;Grief to heal or joy to more?  
Joy his brightest crown can borrow,  
Balm distills for ev’ry sorrow.  
&emsp;&emsp;From the dear delights of Love  
Warmed by Love’s etherial beam  
&emsp;&emsp;Smiles dark poverty illume;  
Wealth without it is a dream  
&emsp;&emsp;Of splendid cares and stately gloom.  
Ah, my Friends, all seasons prove  
The pow’r and worth of mighty Love!

My boyish heart to fancy waking,  
With a dreary void was aching  
&emsp;&emsp;Till it owned Love’s soft control;  
Then each ravish’d sense was thrilling —  
Now, a kindly warmth instilling,  
&emsp;&emsp;Constant Love inspires my soul.  
Thus in giddy Youth he reigns,  
&emsp;&emsp;Thus he charms in Manhood sage,  
And his purest fire remains  
&emsp;&emsp;To warm the freezing pulse of Age.  
Ah, my Friends, all seasons prove  
The pow’r and worth of mighty Love!
