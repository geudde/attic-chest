See genius sickening at the ills of life  
With penury maintain a glorious strife,  
In that sad hour when want and pining care  
Has stripped his garret, worn his garments bare,  
Furrow’d his manly front, while his wan cheek  
The ravages of famine seem to speak;  
Oppress’d but not o’ercome — intent alone  
On Science, seated, on her radiant throne  
The mild attractive graces in her train  
These, he invokes nor yet invokes in vain;  
For, all apparent to his raptured eye  
The genius, Inspiration, hovers nigh,  
Prompts him to let imagination soar  
To truth’s bright realm; and from her sacred store  
Collect some rays such knowledge to impart  
As may inform the mind and touch the heart,  
Studious by wit and judgement well combined  
Less to astonish than to mend mankind  
He listens and conceives some lofty theme  
Anxious to realize the flatt’ring dream:  
Then takes the pen; and with his backward hand  
Repels the spectres that around him stand;  
Care, Famine, dire disease with grisly stare  
Who pressing on, beset his tott’ring chair  
When lo! like pensive mis’ry, as he sits  
The gently opening door a guest admits;  
A stranger, and of countenance benign  
Who enters leading in a form divine.  
Sweet smiling hope — and straight a scroll unfolds  
Which struck with mute amaze he fixed beholds;  
With eager eye, enraptur’d thus he reads  
The Literary Fund this message speeds  
It bids desert and genius pine no more  
It says ’tis yours, unsought to share the store  
Which pure Benevolence, as tribute due  
Adjudg’d to merit, and assigns to you.
