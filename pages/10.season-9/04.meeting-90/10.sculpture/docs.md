The god-like act to pound the marble form,  
And wrest life’s semblance from Time’s cank’ring worm  
T’embody Fancy; stamp on Vision, Fame;  
Be this the theme, for Heav’n first taught the same.

“Image of Us, we make!” th’ Almighty said —  
He spoke, and man lay sculptur’d in his bed —  
Stiff, clay-bound, mute; inanimate and cold,  
The fine-wrought statue pass’d its heav’nly mould.  
The work was good. The Word, and God proceed;  
Life stirs in breath; and the lock’d limb is freed —  
That which was cold is warm — the image springs,  
Moves, looks, and smiles unutterable things —  
A smooth, strong current plays through every vein,  
And what was torpid throbs to joy or pain.

Thus Man remain’d — His model pass’d away;  
But sacred legends told the work and day,  
In after-age, to rouse the panting mind,  
To tempt rude essays and leave words behind;  
So grew the work, and strengthened to an act,  
Sculpture was born, and learned of Taste her part,  
Laugh’d on the breast of Fame, and flung at Time a dart.

Thus sprang the Maid, when wild and young  
She dwelt with Judah’s lofty pride;  
But impious thoughts misrul’d her tongue  
And Idols her sweet from belied:

Sore was the threat, and sore the deed,  
&emsp;&emsp;And thousands in her errors bleed:  
But mild Repentance check’d the dreadful storm,  
And Moses screen’d her in the brazen emblem’s form.

Celestial Piety now kiss’d the wayward child,  
Sway’d her rude course — by her sweet voice beguil’d  
&emsp;&emsp;To grave reserves her doctrine will’d  
&emsp;&emsp;She wrought the docile mind;  
&emsp;&emsp;Her ear with truths sublime she fill’d,  
And with the mark of God her forehead signed.  
&emsp;&emsp;Round the Temple’s ark they stray,  
&emsp;&emsp;On the Mercy-seat recline;  
&emsp;&emsp;Spread the Cherub’s wing for play,    
&emsp;&emsp;Or bear the imag’d cup for wine.  
Lo sweet Religion train’d the lovely maid,  
Till youth bloom’d strong, and care withdrew its aid,  
And Sculpture bounded free — no more by guardians sway’d.

Now vagrant hopes usurp the Maiden’s theme,  
Illume her waking soul, and flutter in each dream —  
&emsp;&emsp;At length she held the impulse meet,  
&emsp;&emsp;While thought to Action grew;  
&emsp;&emsp;She brac’d her rosy sandal’d feet,  
As round her form the graceful robe she drew —  
&emsp;&emsp;The veil conceal’d the ringlet’s wave,  
&emsp;&emsp;And screen’d the flash of her bright eye;  
&emsp;&emsp;Hid the arch lip carnation gave,  
&emsp;&emsp;And dimples too which nestled nigh —

Throughout the Nile-fed land was homage paid the Fair;  
As Isis here — when veil’d, as Nature, there.  
Some kiss’d the Lotus-crown she wore,  
Some couch’d beneath her throne;  
Or thousand imag’d tributes bore,  
Of ductile gold, or adamantine stone —  
&emsp;&emsp;On all she gazed with placid mien,  
&emsp;&emsp;And told the chisel’s vent’rous way;  
&emsp;&emsp;Or bade the mallet boldly lean,  
&emsp;&emsp;To each she lent some haughty grace,  
Turn’d the gigantic arm, or shaped the Sphynx-like face,  
Stamped on each native work the air of Egypt-race.
