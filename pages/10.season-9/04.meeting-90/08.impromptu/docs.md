> Written with the pen of a lady whose inkstand the Author found upon his Table

A Fairy left a silver stand,  
To tempt to verse a lazy hand,  
&emsp;&emsp;That long had cease’d to write,  
The pen the charmed fingers seized,  
And the dull brain incessant teased  
&emsp;&emsp;A stanza to indite.

Ah! could I teach thee, trembling hand  
To sing the owner of this stand  
&emsp;&emsp;In strains that might deserve her  
Thou’dst paint in numbers soft and clear  
The homage, willing and sincere  
&emsp;&emsp;With which my heart would serve her.

Thou’dst sing of lovely form and face  
Of winning all-attractive grace,  
&emsp;&emsp;Of charms for ever new.  
And, if I might expressions find  
To paint the still more lovely mind,  
&emsp;&emsp;Its beauties bring to view.

But Ah! enchanted pen — in vain  
Dost thou inspire a ready strain  
&emsp;&emsp;My heart or head to prove —  
The glowing thought disdains the lay  
When, wrapt in bliss the livelong day  
&emsp;&emsp;I gaze in silent love.
