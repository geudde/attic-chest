> On Capt. Harvey of Battle in Sussex, who perished with his young Brother and Sister.

While gallant Harvey, thro’ deep water, tried  
To save two kindred Darlings at his side,  
“Grant me, good Heaven! (he said) with heart and hand  
To bear this sacred burthen safe to land!”  
“Not safe to land!” (so with benign control  
The Angel of his Birth inspired his soul)  
“Bear them more blessed than what thy vows require  
Safe to the bosom of our heavenly Sire.”
  
Ye earthly mourners! may your hearts resign  
So rich a treasure to the Will divine!  
Few parents can receive from awful Fate  
A blow so grievous, and a loss so great.
