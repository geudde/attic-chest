Momus went forth to seek the Muse  
And call’d at ev’ry place for news,  
Then to the Office came where Wit,  
Truth and Imagination sit:  
There smiling shew’d a muffled Dame  
The honour and reward to claim.  

Truth half askance the claimant eyed  
“Is this a Muse!! — how sanctified!  
What strange attire! a day-school Miss  
Would scorn to wear a hat like this:  
This is some kerchief’d sempstress come  
To bring the Muses’ plain-work home.”  
  
Aside the modest Stranger threw  
Her ample hood of homespun blue,  
And with a voice as shrewd and sly  
Made laughing answer — Why am I  
Unlike a Muse? — Where-e’er I tread  
Gay hues and silv’ry light I spread:  
I hold a wand which scatters flow’rs  
O’er clay-wall’d huts and lonely tow’rs;  
And that sweet alchymy I teach  
Which pining sages cannot reach,  
Which finds in ev’ry heart a treasure  
And all I touch transmutes to pleasure.”

With me, into its lone recess  
The heart retiring, may possess  
A richer banquet than the Muse  
E’er dressed in Fancy’s frolic hues.  
O! all her wildest Legend tells  
Of cities rear’d by fairy-spells,  
Of cobweb-cars that mount the breeze  
Or bow’rs beneath enchanted seas  
Where green-hair’d nymphs their revels keep  
Or couch’d on coral garlands sleep —  
All cannot match the revelry  
I give the Heart which welcomes ME!

Look around this canopy divine!  
Whate’er it compasses is mine!  
The sun beams brightest where I live  
His gladness and his warmth I give  
To all I view — my bland control  
Itself is day-light to the soul —  
If ye have felt it, ye require  
No Muse to lend awak’ning fire:  
Good Nature only can impart  
True Poetry’s most precious art  
A charm in ev’ry scene to find  
And Beauty in all Human-kind.  

You who in Fancy’s Court preside  
Obey me and the Prize divide;  
Who-e’er the mystic seal can read  
Deserves to share the promis’d meed:  
For they who know me best can tell  
Where a soft Muse delights to dwell.  
Good Nature is herself a Muse  
That lends to life poetic hues;  
A gentle fabulist whose pow’r  
Cheats the dull path and lonely hour;  
And while with busy care she brings  
From heart to heart kind offerings,  
She leaves untouch’d the wings of Love  
But keeps his roses and his DOVE.
