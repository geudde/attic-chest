Dear Headytur,

As the gentlefolks like my pottery much, I thought I might try to tell tales as well as they, so I had another lecturefrication. I liked my old master’s way of making pottery best, for he never wrote without a bottle besides him. So Mr. Thomas (my Lord’s gentleman) copied this letter on a piece of foolscap, because he comprehends thography better than me and I hopes my story will please for it is not a fragment but a whole one and I have told all about it straight forward, being your Humble Servant to command

<span class="title">A True Story</span>

Fair Angeline at school was found  
&emsp;Establish’d in a Square —   
(The middle of that square was round  
&emsp;And fifteen trees grew there) 

Miss Angelina had above  
&emsp;Twelve thousand pounds in store  
So Ensign Edwin fell in love  
&emsp;And sigh’d a week or more. 

He hir’d a chaise in White-horse Street  
&emsp;Their ’lopement to begin —   
(That chaise had four wheels and a seat  
&emsp;To sit upon within.) 

Baldock and Biggleswade they passed  
&emsp;(Bugden and Walmsford too — )  
Chang’d horses at the Boar Inn last —    
&emsp;(The Black Boar, not the Blue.) 

They stopped some sparrow-grass to take  
&emsp;With chickens at the Bell Inn,  
’Tween Stamford where men cheeses make,  
&emsp;Near Stilton where they sell ’em.
		
They saw a red and gold-fringed cloud  
&emsp;Swim round the Wrekin’s ridge,  
And counted milestones on the road  
&emsp;Which leads to Borough-Bridge. 
		
Then gentle Edwin look’d about,  
&emsp;And dropp’d the left-hand glass —   
He sigh’d so deep, it seem’d, no doubt  
&emsp;A breeze from Bore*ass*. 
 
Fair Angelina’s words were soft  
&emsp;As Yorkshire-cream and honey —   
Why sighs my swain (says she) so oft?  
&emsp;Says he — I have no money! 

“From Whitehorse-Street to Wetherby  
&emsp;Four horses too much cost — for  
Blind Cupid cannot post-boy be  
&emsp;Nor Imen pay the ostler. 
		
My-lord-chief-justice’s own son  
&emsp;With lovely nightingale  
When they to Scotland chose to run,  
&emsp;Took places in the Mail.

Venus of Med’cines only drives  
&emsp;Two turtles with her chair,  
And he who for a Venus strives  
&emsp;Needs but a chaise and pair.” 
		
Fair Angelina’s eyes dropp’d dew —   
&emsp;“It never shall be said,  
That only in a chaise and two  
&emsp;I ran away to wed. 
	
Miss Deidamia Dawson has  
&emsp;Three ponies to her Tandem,  
And shall she boast that I, alas!  
&emsp;Rode with two hacks at random? 
		
Open the door! — let down the step!  
&emsp;Our parting Fate decrees here!   
I’ll go home to Papa’s own Rep-  
&emsp;-O*sit*ory of Teas, sir!” 
		
Then spoke the Ensign of the Guards —   
&emsp;(The Guards wear blue and buff)  
“If this is all that Love rewards,  
&emsp;We’ve travell’d far enough. 

When Bills are due and Bankers stop,  
&emsp;A free man may be flurried,  
But he who weds can only hope  
&emsp;To bury or be buried.” 

Then spoke the bold Postillion  
&emsp;Right gaily answer’d he,  
“John Perkins never yet look’d on  
&emsp;A lady’s tears to see. 
		
Captains and Squires I go before  
&emsp;And Lords too, all my life —   
And till I hold the reins no more  
&emsp;I need not fear a Wife. 

But, Lady, I’m no boasting elf,  
&emsp;My name is Honest John,  
I’ll go to Gretna-green myself — ”  
&emsp;Said Angeline — “Drive on!” 
		
Now, Lords and Ladies, please to heed  
&emsp;The moral of my verse —   
Let him who means a trip to Tweed  
&emsp;Put money in his purse. 

And, lovely Ladies, if you pray  
&emsp;To ’scape false’s Lovers’ laughter  
Be constant on your bridal-day,  
&emsp;And change at leisure after.
