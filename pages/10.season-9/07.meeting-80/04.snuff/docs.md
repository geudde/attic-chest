Ye Muses ’mong Adonis who dwell  
&emsp;And have noses of tangible stuff  
Come, succour a poor puzzled Belle  
&emsp;Who’s ordained to descant upon snuff.

Dust cephalic, how warm and refreshing  
&emsp;It furs the nose up like a muff  
’Tis both Fox and Bearskin possessing  
&emsp;To be amply supplied with good snuff.  

How oft with catarrh in the head  
&emsp;We snuffle, we sneeze, and we puff,  
Let those then such evils who dread  
&emsp;Seek and early prevention in snuff.

To the brain it gives fancy and vigor  
&emsp;While the skin it makes tawny and tough,  
So that Time cannot dull or disguise  
&emsp;A resolute taker of snuff.

Pandora humanity mocks  
&emsp;’Gainst her perils how few can stand bluff  
You’d be slain with the plagues from her box  
&emsp;Were it not for your own box of snuff.  

On the nose and face tho’ it leave trace  
&emsp;And zig-zag lines dingy and rough  
Such marks my be taken for graces  
&emsp;When known as impressions of snuff.

Embrowned tho’ the finger and thumb are  
&emsp;The coat smeared form cape to the cuff,  
Such spots on the Sun’s disk by some are  
&emsp;Thought beauties, and why not in snuff.  

A Beau for mustachios should pine  
&emsp;To make him look warlike and gruff,  
Oh how like a hero he’d shine  
&emsp;Could he show but mustachios of snuff

’Tis the acme of gallantry’s art  
&emsp;And was practised by Donald McDuff  
He could win the most obdurate heart  
&emsp;With no talent but taking Scotch snuff.

With such sanction my dear nephew Charles  
&emsp;Of Moccabau take *quantum suff.*  
Nor let your Xantippes loud *parles*  
&emsp;Restrain you from feating on snuff.

Nay who that beholds your gay box  
&emsp;And could at it churlishly huff  
Should receive on each ear such a box  
&emsp;As would silence his railing ’gainst snuff.  

And now my dear niece without fiction  
&emsp;Methinks I have reasoned enough  
And forced on your mind full conviction  
&emsp;What virtues are centred in snuff.
