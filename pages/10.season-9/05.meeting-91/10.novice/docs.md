<span class="title">A Fragment</span>

In the 1st Act of this Drama we are inform’d that Sophia of Wurtemberg (presumptive heiress of the Russian throne after her brother Ivan’s mysterious disappearance) took refuge in an Italian convent. Demetrius, and agent of the Empress Catharine, endeavoured to decoy her by professing love, and sent a soldier to escort her thro’ the forest where assassins were instructed to lurk; but instead of Sophia, his wife Paulowna came diguis’d to meet him and fell into the hands of his confederate. She counterfeited death to preserve her own life and her brother’s.  

Only the first and last Acts have been found among the lots sold at a late celebrated auction; but if combined, they give some idea of the plot. Perhaps the rest was disposed of in the portable theatre sold near Harley St. last month.

SCENE, a Subterranean Cemetery’s Entrance 

Enter SOPHIA and DEMETRIUS disguised.

Soph. ’Tis all in vain! no cloister’s rev’rend shade  
No vesper hymn can soothe my soul to peace  
While my lost country bleeds and I am banish’d!  
Come, gentle breeze, and fan my burning brow!

Dem. As these sweet breezes cool the sultry noon  
The breath of bland affection cheers the soul.  

Soph. True, holy father; if the incense breath’d  
By the false world was balmy as this air,  
How soon the fever of the soul would cease!  

Dem. Mine, mine is past! as the chaste moon breaks thro’  
Some fond reluctant cloud, thy virtue pours  
Light on my gloomy soul. Sweet Lady, hear me —   
Be thine th’ absolving ministry of peace,  
A sinner’s place is here &lsqb;kneels&rsqb;

Soph.&emsp;&emsp;Astonishment!  
What purpose lurks in this?  

Dem.&emsp;&emsp;A holy one!  
Love well may wear the garb of Mercy’s priest  
For Mercy’s heav’n is love. Behold my shrine!  
A truer vot’ry never breath’d his vows  
Or sought his saint with fonder pilgrimage.  

Soph. Is this the valiant, sage, renown’d Demetrius!  
The safeguard of his chief — the realm’s delight!  
Has crooked policy no fairer guise?  

Dem. Truth needs a guise in courts — my face has worn  
Smiles foreign to my heart to win thy foes  
Whose brooding souls no softer purpose nurse  
Than murder, midnight murder! O beware  
The ready slaves of treason seek their prey  
In royal Beauty’s couch.  

Soph.&emsp;&emsp;I thank your zeal,  
But this is heav’n’s own mansion and its arm  
Shall crush the traitor who invades my rest  
To murder or deceive.  

Dem.&emsp;&emsp;If all the ardor  
Heav’n wakes in Man to guard its fairest work  
Can claim Sophia’s trust, this faithful hand  
Shall from her sacred bosom turn the sword  
Or bury it in mine —   

Soph.&emsp;&emsp;’Tis fitly spoken  
The prudent chief reserves his sword for kings  
And vindicates with words his zeal for justice.  

Dem. Shall words alone attest it? Smile, Sophia —   
Smile and my constant arm shall hew its way  
Thro’ hireling crowds and plant thy banner high  
While tyrants gasp in chains.  

Soph. Go on and prosper!  
If suff’ring nations call thee, rend their yoke  
But spare the guilty! — leave in Heav’n’s red store  
Th’ avenging bolt, and all its richest gifts  
Shall cluster round thy head!  

Dem.&emsp;&emsp;One, only one  
I ask to crown my toil — Sophia’s love!  

Soph. Be thankful for my pity! When I fall  
My love shall stoop to traitors. &lsqb;Exit&rsqb;

Dem. Stay, proud princess!  
Why is her scorn so beauteous? Am I dust  
That thus she spurns me? Hold thy strength, my soul!  
Love with revenge shall banquet.

&lsqb;Enter Father Lawrence leading back Sophia&rsqb;

Father Lawrence. Lady, by holiness, by truth’s own self  
Thus I adjure thee! — Fly! — yon knightly guide  
Waits thro’ these devious paths and fun’ral caves  
To lead thy soundless footsteps — take his aid —   
Mine and heav’n’s blessing guard ye! &lsqb;Exit&rsqb;  

Soph.&emsp;&emsp;Mercy, mercy!  
Demetrius, not for life or help I crave  
It is thy presence wounds me — let me die,  
But not by smiling ruffians!  

&lsqb;Enter Menzikoff with a torch&rsqb;  

Dem.&emsp;&emsp;Menzikoff!  
Advance and take thy trust — imperial lady  
How thou hast wrong’d my honour thou wilt learn  
And own, perchance, with smiles. When next we meet  
Moscow’s high throne shall be thy resting-place &lsqb;Exit&rsqb;

Menz. &lsqb;approaching and speaking to himself as he views her&rsqb;  
&emsp;&emsp;Thou most fair pile  
Of frozen pride by woman’s cunning deck’d!  
He loves her then! She loves him! The proud princess  
A sage confessor finds in young Demetrius!  
O this is tenfold vengeance! She shall perish  
The smiling saint-like siren and her minion!  
Is it for her he wrongs me? Was’t for this  
He mock’d my sister’s faith?

Soph.&emsp;&emsp;Is this form human?  
Methinks if dark unearthly spirits walk  
They must look thus, with lips so marble-white,  
And eyes like fun’ral lamps in hollow cells  
Glaring with livid light — I’ve seen such smiles  
Part the pale lips of an expiring man  
When his soul’s hope was past.  

Menz.&emsp;&emsp;Follow me, Lady!  

Soph. That voice is from the grave! It is a vision  
Of this sepulchral gloom! I tread on tombs —   
Alas! what phantasies my fear hath rais’d!  

Menz. Thou knowst me not —   

Soph.&emsp;&emsp;I’ll tell thee what thou art!  
A slave by tyrants chosen to fill up  
The measure of their crimes. I pity thee  
More than myself, tho’ thou art come to lead me  
To an unhallow’d grave, for thou wilt live  
A thing for scorn to hiss at and devour;  
And the base gold which bribes thy coward heart  
Shall canker and consume it. Raise thy torch,  
And look into what mounds of hateful dust  
Av’rice and Grandeur drop their shining hoards,  
Then win them if thou can’st.

Menz.&emsp;&emsp;Thou know’st me not!  
None know me now! But once in Moscow’s court  
A fair dame sat on Pow’r’s imperial throne  
Whose beauty was my sunshine — while it smil’d  
The summer of my youth was rich with flowers  
And laurels grew to deck me — Soon they fell!  
Dishonour stripp’d the blazon from my name —   
Friends were unfaithful, and with hearts most cold  
Join’d the false world in crushing him whose breast  
Shrank from no stab but theirs!  

Soph.&emsp;&emsp;Menzikoff!  
Thou cam’st for vengeance, then? Or would’st thou buy  
The smiles of thy proud empress once again  
With innocent blood?  

Menz.&emsp;&emsp;Tonight my sister’s tears  
Fell on my cheek — my hand has felt her touch  
The touch of softness, innocence and love —   
And could I stain it think’st thou, with one drop  
From veins so pure? Think of thy brother, lady,  
I have a brother’s heart.  

Soph.&emsp;&emsp;Mock me not now  
With thoughts of him thy cruel mistress slew.  

Menz. Lady, they say the guilty brow has speech,  
The false man’s lips have vows and eloquence  
But noble hearts are dumb. I will not swear  
That thou hast wronged me. Thou shalt ask my eyes  
If e’er they look’d on murder.  

Soph.&emsp;&emsp;Speak again!  
Say thou are innocent!

Menz.&emsp;&emsp;’Twere abject guilt  
To say I have not err’d. I have stray’d far  
From honour and firm faith, for when I knelt  
By thy lost brother’s prison-couch and heard  
His executioner’s tread, I did not save him  
Until I thought of thee!

Soph.&emsp;&emsp;Of me? Alas!  
Thou never knew’st me.  

Menz.&emsp;&emsp;Yet for thee I saved him:  
He told me of his sister, one whose hope  
Hung on his life — of one whose heart and form  
Were twin with his: then sadly to my thoughts  
Came my own orphan sister, brotherless —   
I tore the midnight mandate of his death  
And led him forth to freedom.

Soph.&emsp;&emsp;Lives he yet?  

Menz. To distant lands he fled and on my brow  
Fell the dark brand and signet of his murder  
But I have borne it well — his blessing seem’d  
A dew that fed my soul tho’ from his lips  
It dropp’d half-frozen.

Soph.&emsp;&emsp;Could’st thou deem him thankless?  

Menz. We parted without smiles — without one grasp  
Of intermingled hands, and his proud spirit  
Look’d from his shrinking eye as if it loath’d  
Life from my gift altho’ its price was mine.  
His youthful beauty was his panoply:  
He had a cherub’s cheek and such a smile  
As rosy childhood shows us when it sleeps.  
His tongue was womanish — his heart was man’s,  
Hollow and dark and stony!

Soph.&emsp;&emsp;From my lips  
A warmer blessing take — thy mercy sav’d  
The sister, not the brother!  

Menz.&emsp;&emsp;Not the brother!  

Soph. In manhood’s garb I wore my brother’s chain,  
The sceptred woman’s minions knew him not,  
And ’twas a gracious fraud: yet oft, perchance  
My fitful weakness wrong’d his noble name  
For woman’s bravery is brief — and thine  
Mock’d my faint tongue, wan cheek and tearful eye.  
Now, if my silence stung thee, take my praise:  
I am again thy captive, and I know  
Thou was’t a gentle gaolor.  

Menz.&emsp;&emsp;Do I wake?  
Or have I dream’d till now?  

Soph. No, noble Menzikoff;  
Thy better soul has slept — Revenge and pride  
Have lur’d thee to heap scorpions on thyself  
And seal thy own despair. &lsqb;Bell tolls&rsqb;

Menz. It is the signal!  
The wolf-dogs are awake — Come forth my sabre!  
This hour redeems or crushes me — Have faith,  
Princess, have faith! Nor vengeance nor despair  
Burns in me now. Souls of my fathers, aid me  
One hour — one glorious hour!

&lsqb;Enter Father Lawrence and Attendants&rsqb;

Law.&emsp;&emsp;Thine ear is apt;  
It is the noon of night when Justice wakes  
The rend the traitor’s web. Thou are my pris’ner.  
Yield, double hypocrite!  

Menz.&emsp;&emsp;To whom? to thee!  
Thou lean artificer of woe — whose face  
Dares not affront Day’s eye! Away, my sword  
Disdains thy frozen blood —   

Soph.&emsp;&emsp;Mercy, have mercy!  
If ye love justice, spare him!

Law.&emsp;&emsp;Bear them hence —   
His crime is writ in blood. Lead to the danger  
Demetrius waits him there —   

Menz. Demetrius taken!  
Then Chance is providence!  

Law. Away, away  
The hour is ripe — today is wisdom’s prize,  
Tomorrow laughs at fools. &lsqb;Exeunt&rsqb;

SCENE. The Hall of Justice, Inquisitors seated under a black canopy with Attendants. Enter Demetrius guarded.

1st.&emsp;&emsp;Inquisitor. Unmask the prisoner!  
Thou art accused of crimes whose lightest name  
Freezes the unsear’d heart: thou has profan’d  
A cloister’s holiest shade and lur’d by vows  
Of most abhorred deceit, a royal maid  
To meet beneath the forest’s blackest screen  
Thy purchas’d murd’rer’s knife.

Dem.&emsp;&emsp;Most holy fathers  
Heralds of heav’n on earth, I bow before ye  
With reverential awe. Behold this scroll  
The mandate of your chief! It bids me claim  
A fair but faithless princess whose dark wiles  
Profan’d the church of peace. Unseen, unaided,  
She fled from saints to warm a warrior’s breast.

1st. Inq. Priests! Ministers of Justice! shall pure blood  
Flow round out altars? Wrest the scroll from him.  
That forg’d and impious mandate! That false signet  
Of power as false — 

Dem.&emsp;&emsp;Know ye the pow’r ye brave?  
It shall unseat these walls and heap your shrines  
With ashes till ye free me — Smile, proud priest!  
This burning dome shall light thee —   

2d. Inq.&emsp;&emsp;Thou say’st true;  
Thyself shall kindle a bright beacon-flame  
To warn our foes. Cam’st thou to seek the princess?  
Behold! She waits thee here!

&lsqb;The black curtain is rais’d and discovers a bier covered with a nun’s veil&rsqb;

3d. Inq.&emsp;&emsp;Bring forth the witness!  
The frank and ready ruffian whose bold hand  
Show’d as its own dire deed.

&lsqb;Enter Stephano chained&rsqb;

Dem.&emsp;&emsp;Stephano here!  
Then heav’n itself has fiends to serve its purpose.  

1st. Inq. Man, look upon us!  
Know’st this warrior’s voice and visage?  

Step.&emsp;&emsp;Ay!  
Dark nights have seen us meet — this gold was his —   
The forest-glades have fresh and grassy mounds  
Look well beneath them!

Dem.&emsp;&emsp;Slave! apostate slave!  
Thou had’st a golden price. I pay thee now  
With steel in thy heart’s core &lsqb;Offering to stab him.&rsqb;  

1st. Inq.&emsp;&emsp;Bear hence the guilty —   
He hath confessed. What fearful shout is yon?  
Who rushes on us thus?

&lsqb;Enter Menzikoff&rsqb;  

Menz.&emsp;&emsp;Another witness!  
I am his guilt’s accomplice —   

Dem.&emsp;&emsp;Hear him not!  
He is my direst foe — suborn’d to crush me —   
He utters the base coinage of his hate —   
Hear him not, holy judges!  

Menz.&emsp;&emsp;Erring man!  
I bring thy ransom. Venerable chiefs,  
Blood rests no there. The purpose, not the deed  
Sits on his soul. The virgin princess fled  
Unstain’d by ruffian-touch and lives to claim  
Mercy for him and me.

Step.&emsp;&emsp;Monks, guard him well!  
His whisper urg’d me first — his tongue beguil’d her:  
Deep in the forest’s darkest dell I saw him  
Stretching her stiffen’d corpse — My scar’d  
The coward from his toil: Even as she lies  
On that dark bier, he left her — the torn flow’rs  
Hang in her tresses yet.

2d. Inq. &lsqb;to Demetrius&rsqb; If thou art guiltless  
Advance and shrink not — lift that sacred veil —   
If thou art guiltless, on her ice-cold breast  
Lay thy firm hand and swear it! Kneel! behold!  

&lsqb;The bier unveiled discovers Paulowna’s body&rsqb;  

3d. Inq. Mark how his stiffen’d locks uplift themselves  
While his shrunk eyeballs in their caverns hid  
Turn inwards their dire light — he reels — sustain him —   
Sinner, awake!  

2d. Inq.&emsp;&emsp;Nature cries out against thee —   
Ev’n thy own life-blood of its source asham’d,  
Curdles and chills thy heart. Thou are the murd’rer.

1st. Inq. He faints — remove him — let the axe prepare  
To close his doom. Now, Menzikoff, approach!  
If thou has wrong’d the dead, behold and tremble.

Menz. Beat yet awhile, my spirit! Oaths are vain  
When cowards swear — I mock not heav’n with words  
A brave man’s eye is his heart’s orator —   
thus to the test I bow —   

&lsqb;As he kneels beside the bier, Paulowna rises&rsqb;

3d. Inq.&emsp;&emsp;Are angels busy?  
What miracle is this?  

Paul.&emsp;&emsp;They shall not part us —   
He was — he is my husband. No, I dream  
It is my noble brother!  

2d. Inq.&emsp;&emsp;Tell, fond woman,  
Who lur’d thee from thy cloister’s sainted shade  
To the grim forest-dell where, mocking death,  
Or sunk my baleful drugs in stubborn slumber,  
Our holy brethren found thee?  

Paul.&emsp;&emsp;My own hand  
Prepar’d the opiate-cup — my own heart crav’d it  
A balsam for its pangs — Oh he is innocent!  
Most innocent, most wretched! my lost brother,  
Pardon the desperate deed!  

1st. Inq.&emsp;&emsp;Avoid the hall —   
We must confer in secret

&lsqb;Ext. Assistants except one monk&rsqb;

&emsp;&emsp;Menzikoff!  
He who dares to tread the charnel-house of guilt  
And hold communion with its habitants  
In his own bosom shall receive the pest  
And feel the death-worm cling. Thou has been leagued  
With slaves and traitors till the hue of vice  
Ev’n on thy virtue creeps — and virtue doubted  
Partake’s Sin’s penalty — Thy doom is fix’d —   
Here is submissive!  

Menz.&emsp;&emsp;Sister, spare thy tears.  
I left thy tender youth unfenc’d to wreck,  
And well deserve to want that pity here  
My sternness once denied — if bigot-rage  
Leaves thy heart human, priest, preserve this ring  
For her ye tore from me tonight, and tell  
The monk Ladvanus to take the ring  
No, I forget, thy hard touch would pollute it —   
Sister, receive this pledge — thou has lov’d once,  
And with a softer hand may veil the faults  
Of a lost brother when his grave is clos’d:  
Then say he loved Sophia — say he knew  
To love her was ambition, but her smile  
Made the sin holy.

1st. Inq.&emsp;&emsp;Menzikoff!  
Know’st thou me not?  

Menz. Thou are the faithless monk  
Whose face no man hath seen — whose wither’d hand  
Lurks ever unreveal’d. None know thy name  
But fiends may call thee brother.

1st. Inq.&emsp;&emsp;View me now!  
Monks name me holy Lawrence — a fond sister  
Calls me imperial Ivan! I am he  
Whose birthright was a throne — a churchman’s cowl  
Sits lighter on my forehead than a crown  
Beset with traitor’s stings. Men deem me dead  
And thy proud empress triumphs on my grave  
While I behold her crumbling throne and smile.  
Thou had’st a precious hostage once and I  
Owe thee a bright reward. Receive it, Menzikoff  
Receive it with a brother’s blessing rich  
Such as thyself would give — Love sometimes steals  
A cowl and wears it thus — &lsqb;Sophia drops her cowl&rsqb;

Menz.&emsp;&emsp;Sophia! Heav’n  
Has now no gift to add.

Ivan.&emsp;&emsp;Go, blessed ones!  
My pow’r, the awful pow’r which empires fear,  
Has smooth’d your path to freedom, and this shrine  
Shall sanctify your love: the bridal lamp  
Burns brightest in the hall where Justice dwells  
While blushing guilt departs to meet is doom.  
Virtue itself may softer beauty win  
From the long shadows of repented sin  
As the returning sun gives richer dyes  
To clouds dissolving, than to spotless skies.
