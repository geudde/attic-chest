<span class="title">Translated from the French of the Comte Léandre de &#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; by Anacreon Lovelorn</span>

If weariness and sorrow  
Each gloomy day annoy  
If the evening and the morrow  
Be pass’d in cloudless joy —   
What the bands of care releases  
What each glowing joy increases  
Ah, ’tis love that always charms  
Love that every grief disarms — 

Glory’s trump with martial swell  
Calls me from Glycera far  
But I’ll not forget my Belle  
In the boisterous fields of war.  
When I combat all the while  
Mem’ry banquets on her smile —   
Ah, ’tis love that always charms  
In festive hours, or fields of arms.

By soft prose again recalled —   
Be it mine again to sip  
In a rapturous spell enthrall’d  
The rich nectar of her lip  

Her converse is a feast divine  
Gods might envy when they dine  
O ’tis love that always charms  
Festive hours, and peace and arms
