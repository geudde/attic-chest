See how sweetly blooms yon op’ning Rose,  
&emsp;That young summer’s radiance flushes!  
Love’s best emblem mark, its leaves disclose  
&emsp;Softest wishes, smiles and blushes:  

Yet with summer roses vanish;  
Ages’ winter love shall banish;  
&emsp;Wreaths of roses 
Twine then while still they’re gay!  
&emsp;Love’s sweet blossoms  
Call then in youth’s fresh May!

Yonder see the shining Myrtles bloom,  
&emsp;Friendship’s emblem, pure unfading;  
Mark their sober green and mild perfume,  
&emsp;With no flaunting sweets parading:  
There no covert thorns are lurking,  
Mischief veil’d in sweetness working:  
&emsp;Wreaths of myrtle  
In green perennial shine —   
&emsp;Holy friendship  
Still blooms tho’ years decline!

With my Celia would I twine a wreath  
&emsp;Of the Rose and Myrtle blended;  
That, their sweets no more tho’ roses breathe,  
&emsp;Still its verdure were not ended;  
As our roses’ bloom is shedding,  
Shall our myrtles’ growth be spreading:  
&emsp;Love’s bright radiance  
Shall light our youthful day —   
&emsp;Tender Friendship  
Shall gild our years’ decay!
