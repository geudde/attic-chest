> “Ah! Vous dirai-je?”

Ah! could it speak! and there are few  
Old Time would speak so softly to,  
For years of pain and care have past  
Yet on thy brow no snowdrops cast;  
And not a print is there to show  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;What Time might tell.

Ah! would it speak! if then thine ear  
Should gentle tales incline to hear  
Thou might’st a secret legend learn  
Of hope that live without return  
And whispers to the slow-pac’d year  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Soon Time shall tell.”

The shell upon the sea-rock’s side  
Still echoes to its native tide;  
Tho’ motionless and cold it lies  
The list’ning ear may hear its sighs:  
So pines a heart in sullen pride  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;As Time shall tell.

It linger’d in a living grave  
Then bounded high on Fortune’s wave;  
But *one* disdain’d the prize, nor knew  
The rarest pearl is dark in hue.  
Shall none the slighted wand’rer save?  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Time comes to tell.

Ah! let the kind adviser teach,  
Gentle and brief and slow in speech  
Like Friendship when it speaks in death,  
Like Love which fears its own soft breath,  
And leaves the word it cannot reach  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;For Time to tell.

Fair Lady! Time is in thy hand;  
Use it with touch discreet and bland,  
And while it moves on diamond feet  
Its golden tongue shall truth repeat:  
But if thy heart can understand  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;’Tis time to tell!

Thy Valentine
