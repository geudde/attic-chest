<span class="title">Verses Written by Dr Brande in 1802</span>

Oh give me in this calm retreat  
Forgetting former cares,  
To pass in Peace and Leisure sweet,  
My few remaining years.

What though this crazy mortal hut  
Be hastening to decay;  
Its shatter’d windows wholly shut,  
To ev’ry glimpse of day.

Yet still the mental taper burns  
With undiminish’d light;  
And love and friendship strive by turns,  
To change to day my night.

Thus time shall gently glide away  
Till he in whom I trust  
Directs this mass of mouldering clay  
To mingle with the dust.

Awaking then from Life’s strange dream  
Ah whither shall thou go!  
Of heavenly fire thou vital gleam,  
That power alone can know.

That boundless Power who plac’d us here  
Who here hath been our guide,  
Whose might, whose wisdom I revere,  
And in His love confide.
