My bill is paid — and now I’d fain  
Mount my fleet steed, and off again  
But with the Muse he too is gone  
Tho’ she’d a filly of her own.  
Oh monstrous! the conceited fair,  
Vows that she now will drive a pair!  
And the next Melo Dram that’s plann’d  
I dread to see her four in hand.

Oh! my lost steed, though were a creature  
Unmatch’d in motion, strength and feature  
The fairest that in years of yore  
Thy Mother Fancy ever bore —   
Oh never tired, with easy motion  
He flew alike o’er earth and ocean  
Would skip along the rockiest coast —   
O’er Afric’s sands or Zembla’s frost.  
Where peaks ascend and tempests rule  
When surer than the dumbest mule  
And tho’ he ever loved to eat  
Ne’er cast me yet a doit for meat  

His food was smiles and kindly looks  
The murmur of the running brooks  
Soft music’s sound and smell of books  
No Peri ever lived more spare  
Than this fleet “courser of the air”  
And when I’d bid him go to rest  
His stable was some eagle’s nest  
Above this grossed world of ours  
In his bright mother’s air-built towers.

Oh! what a change! I well may rail  
Thus wedge within a Dover mail  
Mid lap dogs, lobsters, bonnets, laces  
Onions and garlic — sad my case is  
With would-be gentry, would-be graces  
Rattling away o’er mud and stones  
In instant dread of broken bones  
Yet as along we gaily dance  
How different is this swift advance  
From Tortoise Diligence of France.

Well I’m in London once again  
To make another quest in vain,  
Perchance amid the Elgin Marbles  
Their praise my truant Damsel warbles.  
Or weeps o’er broken legs and arms  
O’er fragments of unrivall’d charms  
And wishes she could breath a strain  
Might give each perfect form a gain  
What tho’ in France they bid defiance  
Here she may form a league with science  
Admire the Emerald’s green or gaze  
Upon the Diamond’s lucid blaze.  
Or wonder at the unrivall’d stores  
Of metals in their richest ores  
Not Fancy brighter hues has won  
From the rich rainbows of the sun —   
Nor beam the gems with lovelier light  
Tho’ here those genuine gems invite.  
Oh! I could gaze and age — to view  
Each curious form, each brilliant hue  
Mark Nature’s frolics when she forms,  
Her crystal walls round flies and worms  
Rain drops impound — like pigs in trouble  
And tipsy crystals that see double

Upstairs mid bronzes — medals, vases  
Below, with mummies in their cases  
Or Alligators, who have got  
With man a century’s wear — dry rot.

I seek my muse, and sooth to tell,  
Find many a muse I fancy well;  
Many that seem in marble warm,  
Many beneath a poet’s arm,  
And many smiling as I pop  
Where books weigh’d down the groaning shop.  
For heavy books in days of old  
Were evils — now they’re traps for gold  
And judges well know how to state  
Their solid matter by their weight.

Yes, in each shop, in every street  
I muses by the hundred meet  
But, woe the day! they’re not my own  
Tho’ while I speak like her they’re flown

I’m near methinks, I’ll stop to view  
The mighty bridge of Waterloo —   
Oh Seine — thou muddy gutter, hide  
The pygmy things that span thy tide  
Boast them no more — together thrown  
They match no this vast mass of stone. 

Enraptured on the arch I stood  
And gazed upon the living flood  
That foamed around a thousand oars  
And murmured on its busy shores.

But lo! I’m lifted from the ground  
I hang above the gulf profound  
I’m borne, as in some dream of flight  
Up to a building glittering white  
Or where the partial blackness thrown  
Gives depth and grandeur to the stone  
I soar above a spacious square  
It is the Louvre I declare!  
No hush — thy recreant to thy land  
The Louvre is not half so grand  
Now thro’ an open sash I press  
(The window’s dirty, I confess)  
But oh within, are figures fraught  
With life — can marble thus be wrought?  
Pygmalion come — thy secret give —   
Alas! I only think they live  
See Hebe, with a mortal face  
But sprightly, fraught with youthful grace  
And there’s a muse — but ah I see  
No English Muse — no muse for me  
However light, however fair  
An English heart wants something there  
And turns as to its home — to trace  
Yon mother with her infant race  
With that best book to mortals given  
Training their dutious minds for heaven.

Those sisters in youth’s halcyon hours  
Cropped like their own pale drooping flowers  
So soft, so tranquil seems their sleep  
Affection long mught watch and weep  
To see those cherish’d eyes awake  
But ’tis a trance they cannot break.

Satan avaunt! I’d rather be  
Yon vulture’s prey, than look at thee  
His noble air, his lightening eyes  
Bespeak the avenger of the skies  
How deep his beak, his claws, would strike thee  
Thou’rt low indeed if this be like thee

Whoe’er thou art — presiding power  
Who spurs’t me onward at this hour —   
Have mercy, both by land and sea  
Think of my toils — an dset me free  
See on the dirty stairs I drop,  
Another flight; ah! let me stop —   
Hurra! Hurra! I’ve reached the top

How large the room, how bright the glare  
Portraits, originals — how fair —   
But hush! I cannot now explore  
Or India’s hills, or Afric’s shore  
I care not for Queen Catherine’s tears  
Nor Carthiginian shame and fears  
Here are a thousand things to claim  
The eye of taste, the voice of fame  
But I am hurried down again  
Amid a gay and thoughtless train  
Oh! wondrous — See from mighty Rome  
Her proudest works of sculpture come  
Or rather like some image clear  
Show their pure forms reflected here

Behold that lovely virgin band  
That touch their harps with skilful hand  
Of graceful form, of stature tall  
I seem to know and love them all  
While from each sacred harp is thrown  
A lofty and a varied tone  
Yet each how well, how dearly known!  
Yes notes like these so soft so clear  
My Muse oft sung in Fancy’s ear  
Oft when my heart was sad and low  
Sent grace and softness to my woe  
Taught sense and lofty strain — and wit  
With keen yet harmless darts to hit.  
My Muse is here — I clearly see  
Yet which of these fair maid is she?  
No matter — for I love, respect  
Them all and could not one reject  
Since all by turns have lent me aid  
I bow to each celestial maid  
Well pleased to find my journey done  
And hail Nine friends instead of one.

Ye Attic Nymphs your polish’d sandals brace  
Braid your bright hair, and gird you for the race  
Once more distinguish’d by celestial aid  
Again I challenge every tuneful maid  
When next our guardian’s careful hand unlocks  
The sacred depths of yon mysterious box  
Then be our strife — then let each lyre resound  
While tapers gleam and perfumes breathe around  
Then with your rival equal honours share  
Or doubly win the laurels that ye wear.
