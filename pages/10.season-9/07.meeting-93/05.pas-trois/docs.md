O balmy is the evening breeze  
That waves thy bow’rs, sweet Tuileries!  
When with full heart and close-knit thumbs  
A gentle swain expectant comes.  
Divine Blondel! how oft and long  
Thine eye has scann’d yon busy throng  
Exploring ev’ry plum’d capote  
Lac’d pelerine or redingote  
Beneath some envious veil to view  
Thy Decima, with eyes of blue!  
And hark! her step his faith rewards —   
No — ’tis a Colonel of the Guards.  
“Monsieur Le Loup! fine weather this — ”  
“Why, for a stroll not much amiss —   
But yonder comes a cloud and you  
Have no surtout or parapluie.”  
On stalks the warrior, and the swain  
Returns to sigh and gaze again.  
Well, now the sun a form reveals,  
A lengthening shadow this way steals.  
“It is my Decima! I see  
Those lips so rich with Baume de vie!  
Those eyes whose flashes scar’d the gnomes  
Of darkness from the catacombs;  
Those smiles which cheer’d me when I lay  
All ruins on the soft pavé —   
Those cheeks where all the cupids dwell  
Reste! ’tis again mon Colonel!”  
“What, lounging still, Blondel! we’ve stay’d  
These three hours in the promenade —   
Adieu! bonsoir! the sky is full  
Of thunder and the walk grows dull.”  
“Not dull, Monsieur, when eyes of blue  
Wait to mix love-drops with the dew  
Sweet evening gives!” — “Morbleu, ’tis I  
She waits for here.” — “Sir, I deny —   
I have her billet here — she says  
Her heart is like a sugar’d vase  
Candied in Cupid’s oven, fit  
To hold the nosegays of my wit.”  
“Her heart for you! Diantre — was it  
No better than a china-closet  
For such a vain conceited elf  
To lodge upon the empty shelf!  
But hush — the lady comes.” — “Fi donc!  
’Tis but our Ballet-Chief, Leon —   
We’ll send him hence — Monsieur, I see  
Great signs of rain — Tant mieux for me!  
’Tis best on soft and sliding ground  
To practise pirouette and bound.  
Mon cher Blondel! observe, I pray,  
This new pas grâve and balancé.  
Ah ca, mon colonel, with us  
Will you try waltzing a la Russe?”  
“Sir, English waltzing is enough  
Thus with a cane or fisticuff — ”  
“O bête sauvage! I never fight  
Without lorgnettes to aid my sight —   
Adieu, messieurs — that spangled flounce  
And peagreen shoe ma belle announce!”  
“How, at this hour!” — “O fie, I show  
No gentle lady’s billet-doux.”  
“Boaster of Fibsters!” every swain  
Exalts his courage and his cane  
Not Vestris nor Le Picq could show  
More pirouettes or capers new,  
Till peeping thro’ a myrtle’s shade  
Thus spoke a laughing blue-ey’d maid.  
“Together met, one summer’s day,  
A dove, a peacock, and a jay:  
Each heard the call that pleas’d his ear,  
And deem’d his love-sick partner near;  
Each boasting thought himself preferr’d,  
But none perceiv’d the mocking-bird.”
