From Inn and Custom House at Dover  
At length escaped the Muses’ lover,  
And while his eye, in frenzy hurl’d,  
Pursued his search in fancy’s worl.  
To London fast he made approach  
On roof of expedition coach —   
Here as his sight unruptured roves  
Thro’ Kent’s rich vales and clust’ring groves,  
Almost the flying Muse he found,  
And on his long-expectant tongue  
He flowry numbers softly sung.  
But ah! the wheel its giddy round  
Resumed, and hoarser rumbling drowned  
The lay that else your Bard had sung.  

Pass we the journey, pass the gloom  
That veiled his cob-web mantled room,  
Without the presence of the Muse  
Light o’er his garret to diffuse.  
Again each well-worm pen he gnaws,  
Heads, houses, trees and spiders draws,  
In vain his luckless head he scratches  
Reads, walks, sits, thinks, and scrawls by snatches.  
Howe’er he tries, howe’er he chafes,  
No inspiration she vouchsafes.  
At length, “I’ll write no more,” he cries,  
And in his dandiest brim he hies,  
From poet turned to dashing spark  
To take the air in gay Hyde Park.  
There as he listless strolled along  
And idly marked the fluttering throng.  

A beauteous dame on high he saw  
Borne in a gaily-decked landau;  
Her laughing eye of heavenly blue  
And smile of winning grace he knew,  
Yet could he not her title trace  
In memory’s bright by dazzling glass.  
With gentle pressure of the hand  
She welcomed him to Britain’s land,  
“And since,” she cried, “you’ve been in France  
You’ve learned, no doubt, quadrilles to dance;  
At Lady Charlotte’s Ball tonight  
We’ll dance quadrilles in censure’s spite.  
You’ll meet me there? See, here’s a card.”  
Away she drove, and left our Bard  
With pleasure and amazement filled,  
His heart with expectation thrilled —   
To pass the day in Fashion’s heaven  
He dined for once at half-past seven,  
Put on his ball dress at eleven,  
And when approached the midnight hour  
(Not wont as erst with mystic power  
The vigils of romance to keep  
Or lull the sober world to sleep;  
But vow the hour when pleasure wakes  
And festive halls loud music shakes)  
He joined the gaily grouping throng  
Where Paine’s best band their strains prolong;  
Where Gunter has the costly board  
With every costly viand stored;  
When Grecian lamps and chandeliers  
And star-decked Knights and ribboned Peers,  
Plumes, diamonds, flowers, and gauze unite  
With Beauty’s blaze to charm the sight.  
Here scarce his bows of duty paid,  
See at this side the blue-eyed maid  
In graceful elegance advance  
To claim him for the promised dance  
Her modest eye with pleasure beaming  
Her airy figure sylph-like seeming,  
Her rosy chaplet that bespeaks  
A vain attempt to match her cheeks,  
And every nameless witching grace  
That played about her form and face,  
The dullest eye had surely charmed  
The coldest heart had surely warmed.  
But how is this? our Bard in France  
Scarce knew a cotillon to dance,  
And nought had moved him now but shame  
And read to bear a recreant’s name,  
Yet when he’d touched his partner’s hands  
No more like half-scared clown he stands,  
No more he sees the dance begin  
While sad foreboding from within  
Of figures and of steps unknown  
Almost excite a smothered groan.  
No more he dreads to lose his way  
Or cross and jostle in L’Eté —   
No more his waving spirits freeze  
At thought of spoiling La Trenise  
But now he’s airy free and gay  
In Nouvelle Chasse or Moulinet,  
And lightly trips, so strong the spell,  
Thro’ all thy mazes, Pastorelle.  
He dreaded once to act the fool  
In figuring forth Cavalier Seul  
But now a murmer of applause  
Attends his well-cut entre-chats  
And without e’en a Master’s hint  
In steps he rivals famed De Windt.  
What may this mean? thro’ all his frame  
He felt a soul-inspiring flame,  
And could he think that pleasure’s calls  
E’er drew the Muse to fashion’s halls  
This were the spot of fairy ground  
On which his long-lost charmer’s found.  

The fire that in his bosom glowed  
In tenderest phrase now overflowed,  
So flowery soft, his accents fell  
They startled e’en his laughing Belle,  
Who quickly cried, “I must be gone  
To other Balls e’er night be done.”  
As duty bids, the Fair he hands  
To seek her carriage — but how stands  
Our Bard with strange amaze subdued  
That wondrous carriage when he viewed!  
The body seemed a downy cloud  
Where Iris’ brightest colours glowed;  
The rolling wheels with music thrilled;  
The coachman’s seat a Genius filled;  
Soul-moving airs the footman sings;  
The horses fly with eagle wings;  
And the bright maid who fled his arms  
Shone forth a Muse in all her charms.  
Her half-bared leg and light-gowned breast  
And mien, Terpsichore confessed —   
“Adieu!” she cried, “you seek in vain  
A Muse to prompt an Attic strain,  
Beneath my banners all advancing  
The Sisters Nine now take to dancing.  
Nor e’en to Ellen’s strong behest  
Give willing strains to fill her chest.  
Dance then! dance all! and dance your fill,  
Reels, waltzes, Spanish dance, quadrille,  
Or country dance, or what you will!”  
She said — and bade her coachman drive  
To Lady Bab’s, and stay till five.  
The astonished Bard obedient bowed  
And sought again the glittering crowd.  
Danced with the gayest through the livelong night,  
Then found this farewell strain, the last he means to write.
