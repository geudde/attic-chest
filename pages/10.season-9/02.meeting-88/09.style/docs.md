As the Attic Chest admits originals of various kinds, perhaps it may not reject this specimen of a new Official Style, which was copied from the original communication by &emsp;&#42;&emsp;&#42;&emsp;&#42;

My Lord,

I am this day honored with your Lordship’s polite attention to my complaint and have wrote to Lord Liverpool as First Lord of the Treasury mean time do me the honor to accept a copy of my last petition

To

The Honorable Commissioners of Excise  
In hopes this will give no surprise  
The petitioner wants his just arrears  
Witheld for more than thirteen years  
Without assigning any cause  
But to pervert perfection’s laws  
The time approaches fast we see  
When just or not we all must die  
So now is the time let us not neglect  
To hang corruption by the neck
If we to God’s levee would fly  
Do as we would be done by  
For by faith without restitution  
We are lost at the day of retribution  
By carrying like a pedlar’s pack  
Arrears of punishment on our back  
For if that we play fast and loose  
Then we are sure to get a souce 
 
Therefore to avert the indignation of Heaven is to do good when it is in our power without injury to ourselves

I have the honor to be with   
High consideration  
your Lordship’s most  
obedient servant

John Brown of the  
Excise Edinburgh  

27 Feby 1817

To the Rt Hon.   
The Secretary of War
