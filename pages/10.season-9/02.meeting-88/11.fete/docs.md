That this poor globe degenerates, who doubts  
That views this age of masquerades and routs,  
That marked how sober brutes and birds began  
To rival their great type of folly, man  
Till emulous of peacocks and of asses  
The rage for dissipation reached Parnassus.

Phœbus (for strange events to Gods befall!)  
Caught a sad cold at Lady Juno’s ball,  
And in a cap of clouds with golden lace,  
Sat snug at home, to hide his *spotted face*.  
Thalia by his side, in friendly chat  
Of the new pantomimes, of this and that  
Since this for gambols was the season due  
Thought that the Gods might have their gambols too.  
Phœbus approved the plan and fixed Twelfth Night  
To be at home, and all his friends invite.  
“What all!” — “Yes, child, besides some hundred dozens  
Olympian brothers, sisters, sires, and cousins.  
There’s all the deities of North and East  
I can’t do less than ask them once at least.

Since British poets took them by the hand  
They’re rising in the world — you understand.  
Nor are they newly in our circle thrust  
Our friends the Romans introduced us first,  
The Ethiopians too, so oft invite us,  
They’re blameless, though their sable skins may fright us  
And modern practice puts it past a doubt  
That every class may mingle at a rout.”

The day arrived buy how shall I unfold  
The beamy splendours of that hall of gold.  
Bright as gas light, with flickering, living blaze  
Flamed the vast dome, an aggregate of rays.  
The pavement glittered, and a dazzling zone  
Of gilded pillars circumscribed the throne  
Around the frieze, in emblematic pride  
The Colchian Ram displays his glittering hide  
(Like many a gay coquette, which those who win  
Find fair without, but emptiness within — )  
And near Europa’s lordly savage, move,  
The brethren, patterns of fraternal love,  
While backward from the scene the crab withdraws  
And shuns by timely flight the lion’s paws  
That lion crouching at the virgin’s feet  
The arm of justice scarcely dreads to meet.  
The spiteful scorpion seeks the splendid row  
But hides, smooth hippocrite! his sting below  
Nor wounds the Centaur, who with fury hot  
Darts his keen shaft at Amalthia’s goat.  
Like fools that harm their friends, or him, we’re told  
Who killed his goose, and lost the eggs of gold —   
There soft Aquarius limpid stream distills  
And golden fishes wanton in his rills.  
The same clear stream, the same delighted fishes  
That sported once amid the royal dishes  
Till Phœbus leaning from the envious skies,  
Charm’d with the bold conception, bade them rise.

Not Odin’s halls such splendors could unfold,  
Nor India’s sultry gods could *fear the cold*,  
Great was the throng, the whole assemblage gay  
Tho’, strange to tell! the party *met by day*  
In robes with heaven’s etherial lustre bright  
Immortal beauties bear the *test of light*  
Nor find their hair assume a greener hue  
Their white turn yellow, or their rouge look blue  
First Venus came, still radiant beauty’s queen  
Yet not as once on fountful Ida seen  
Not trusting now to native charms alone  
Her gold tiara, or attractive zone  
But in a cashmere shawl her form she muffles  
Her robe in flounces, her fair neck in ruffles.  
Deigns o’er her face a close-tied hat to wear  
Time said, to hide the wrinkles springing there.  
While with a mincing gait around the belle  
Tripped each pert Grace, a smirking demoiselle  
The muses too were changed, the Highland Plaid  
Veils heaven born Poesy’s majestic maid  
And in the robes of some *barbaric* nation  
Each tuneful sister suffers transmigration.  
Soft sentiment from Eratos distils  
Terpsichore studies waltzes and quadrilles  
While Mars his *cuirass* and his shield discards  
Yet keeps his *helm* a Colonel of the Guards  
But should I speak of every beau and belle  
My columns would the Morning Post excel,  
And boast, tho’ with some hundreds of omissions  
More names than one of loyal Hunts petitions.  
I leave the Ocean race, the Olympian fey  
They’re old acquaintance so I pass them by  
And turn to those of foreign birth who play’d  
A striking part, in seeming masquerade.  

From Egypt, gentle Iris first was seen  
A milk white bow, with such a graceful mien  
That Jove half-deem’d he Jo’s self descried  
And envied Apis, lowing by her side  
A giant beetle now the ladies vex’d  
Graceful and tall the slender Ibis next  
Placed daintily her rosy feet and eyed  
The ring with blended modesty and pride  
And neck o’er-arch’d and pretty head aside  
Anubis, barking, led a crowd of shapes  
Half serpents some, half men, half birds, half apes  
And near them with the Gods of Hindostan  
Came their half-brother, monkey Hanuman  
Next mighty Siva with his crescent eye  
More bright than Luna in a midnight sky  
While with his quizzing glass, in modern taste  
A chain of skulls depended to his waist.  
Oh who that breathes, so tasteless but would barter  
For this rich wreath, the collar of the garter  
Or who by envy undisturbed can view  
His three broad eyes, his neck’s celestial blue  
Nor jealous Parvati’s emotion share  
As Ganges sports and wanders in his hair

But Rama most each heaven-born beauty charms  
Now here, now there, he wears a thousand forms.  
Now in a fish his greatness deigns to hide  
Now deems a dwarf but takes a giant’s stride  
And now at once in every place appears  
Her whisper’d praise each raptured Goddess hears  
Now on a hundred well turned legs he stands  
Now like Briareus waves an hundred hands  
While fairest Sita, smiling by his side  
Varies with every change, his fitting bride.  
Cavera hideous, far from sight retires  
And joins at whist the Lemnian god of fires  
Plutus, pursuing still his golden dream  
And raging at his cards, great Polypheme,  
&emsp;In robes that glitter bright with gems of gold  
Where diamonds lurk unseen in every fold  
With eyes, like violets dropping fragrant dew  
With hair that Sabo’s richest scents imbue  
With cheeks whose bloom outvies the opening rose  
With vermil lips whence softest music flows  
That charm by eloquence, by beauty win  
A coral casket to the gems within.  
From Persia’s shadowy groves the Peries fly  
By all beloved, and sought by every eye  
Enamour’d Genii of gigantic stature  
Of mien unpolished and ingraceful feature  
Toil for their smiles, and richer presents bring  
Than those commanded by the lamp and ring.

Behold from Kap’s eternal ices rise  
The Bird of Ages in the future wise  
The Simnaugh who till this auspicious day  
Still shunn’d communion with the young and gay  
Near him, that sacred tree where old and young  
Raffle for prizes to its branches hung  
Diamonds more lucid than the Evening Star  
And virgins than those diamonds brighter far  
Wines, turbans, robes of every hue and size  
Birds ready cook’d and fruits of Paradise  
&emsp;On wings of butterflies from fragrant bowers  
And clothed in petals of the richest flowers  
With thistle down in many a waving crest  
And diamond dew drops from the rosebud’s breast  
The fairies come, their moonlight haunts forsake  
By grove, or winding vale, or silver lake.  
Some light and graceful as the snowdrops bloom  
Some wrapt in silence and unsocial gloom —   
And some with air malign and antic tricks  
Amid the graver powers unbidden mix  
A wee brown man his satin pipe resigns  
To seize a horn that bright with silver shines  
Whose lively measurs, sounding soft and sweet  
To quickest motives lures the unwilling feet  
This erst the gift of friendly Oberon  
From her proud sire the lovely Beria won

In vain the Sultan cursed the knight abhorr’d  
In vain his warriors grasp the shining sword  
Still Heron breathes the dance-inspiring air  
Maid, youth, and bearded priest, the frenzy share  
And the mad Sultan capers high and wild  
Tho’ stolen at once his grinders and his child  
&emsp;But never, never till this merry hour  
Immortals felt its spirit-stirring power  
E’en scornful Juno, tho’ she view’d with spleen  
Her favorite bird caressed by India’s Queen  
Bear smiling Scanda’s weight, or joyful spread  
Its rainbow glories round bright Krishna’s head  
Seized a gay Yaksha’s hand, no, German girl  
Treads with more rapture the delightful whirl  
E’en Pallas from her seat impatient vaults  
And wheels with Bacchus in the hopping waltz.  
&emsp;Then ghastly goblets in their hands appear  
The guests of Odin, but the ladies fear  
Not less those dreadful implements of war  
The sword of Skirner and the mace of Thor  
Which when the Jotni chief for Frega sighed  
Cleft his thick forehead, and redeemed the bride  
Next came in place, the Ash of Yggrdasil  
While from its boughs the honied streams distil  
Its growth from wisdom’s sacred fountains fed  
By two fair Nymphs that wait beneath its shade  
The serpent next his mighty coil unfurl’d  
Those folds whose awful circle girds the world  
And that fierce wolf, which when our race is run  
Shall swallow Odin, and devour the Sun  
Rejoice to see the hostile gods expire  
And <span data-tippy="illegible" class="red">[???]</span> wrap the darkened world in fire  
&emsp;Two Dwarfs to great Apollo’s throne repair —   
Of Kausers blood two ample vases bear  
’Tis said incensed the giant chief they slew  
Then mixed his blood with honey and with dew  
This fluid more of tuneful rage inspires  
Than Pindas’ fountains, or th’ electric fires  
And oft the Nine the powerful beverage claim  
When toil impairs, or dampness chills the flame.  
&emsp;This precious liquor to Gunloda’s care  
Her sire consigned but Odin enter’d there  
Her love he gain’d, her leave his thirst to tame  
With three full draughts of the inspiring stream  
Deep, deep he quaffed, the wondrous vase he drain’d  
Then, as a raven, Asgard’s towers attain’d  
There Asi sons their lord impatient wait  
And spread the ready vessels at the gate  
Slow from his beak distills th’ invalued dew  
While made with rage the Jotni race pursue  
The monarch fears, and of the sacred wave  
A copious stream inferior sources gave  
One warms with Genius, with that fire sublime  
That thrills the heart, and triumphs over time  
And one that strains of meaner bards inspires  
Whose light a moment glimmers and expires.  
&emsp;Spirits of earth, of fire, of sea and air  
At Phœbus call four numerous bands repair  
But who shall count the various tribes that wait  
In motley groups amid his halls of state  
Can tell what muses sung, who danced, who played  
Where charms were brightest, who the best arrayed  
Theirs was the joy insatiate, undefined  
The cloudless pleasure of celestial mind  
Swift flew the hours, till Hermes forward pressed  
And charm’d to slumber each celestial guest  
And in a comely cloud the god of light  
Kerchief’d his head and bade his guests goodnight.
