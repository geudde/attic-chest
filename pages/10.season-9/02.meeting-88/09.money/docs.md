Dear solace of life, precious money I hail thee  
Without thee would wit, wealth or beauty avail me  
O friends, precious friends, what an ague would ail ye

If only my wisdom ye knew  
Then friends let us raise  
Of money the praise  
For he who wants silver dross always wants you.

When hope is all shipwreck’d and care blows a hurricane  
Brave stoic Wisdom may lend us her furry train  
But Virtue and Beauty and flatt’rers will purr again  
When our full purses we show  
Then let us raise &c.
