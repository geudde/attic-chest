<div class="author">Miss Vardill</div>

Venus, of harness’d sparrows tir’d  
Her turtle’s downy coat admir’d,  
And wish’d another of the race  
Her Paphian equipage to grace.  
Hers is a widow’d dove — but where  
Shall one be found to make a pair?  
One for her airy harness fit  
Of gossamer and cobwebs knit.  
The Teian Sage had such a one  
Bought with a song to bribe her son.

First to Anacreon’s heirs she sent  
They knew not what her message meant!  
The dove that lov’d their rosy Sire  
Had left in scorn his shatter’d lyre  
Nor stoop’d its polish’d beak to stain  
In nectar spilt by hands profane.  
Back to its native skies it flew  
To sip the Graces’ honied dew;  
Yet oft the priests of Bacchus bring  
A light down-feather from its wing:  
One flutters yet on Albion’s shore —   
The parent-bird is seen no more.

A gentle Muse, the friend of Love,  
Went forth to match the faithful dove.  
In groves and camps and courts she stray’d  
Nor miss’d the academic shade:  
She tapp’d at cottage-doors, but then  
Saw a mere tame domestic hen:  
In pompous courts she only found  
The painted bird for prate renown’d;  
The rev’rend own, sedate and sage  
Dwelt in the collage-parsonage;  
In camps the pert flamingo star’d  
With scarlet coat and borrow’d beard,  
But the true turtle, meek and kind  
On earth the Muse could never find:  
And she herself, whose tender lay  
Was Love’s own voice, has gone astray;  
Her place is vacant and her lyre  
Unstrung amidst th’ Aonian quire;  
But let the lovely dames who prize her  
In mirthful numbers *advertise* her;  
Send Momus forth with three O yesses  
For Wit can find what Beauty misses.
