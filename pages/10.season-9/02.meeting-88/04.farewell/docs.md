<span class="title">Lady Byron’s Answer to Lord Byron’s *Farewell*</span>

Powerless are thy magic numbers  
To revive affection’s flame,  
In a bosom where it slumbers,  
Shrouded now with duty’s name.  
Sacred there ’twill rest for ever,  
Death alone its gleams remove,  
Still it lives — but never, never,  
Can it more awake to love.  
Did neglect’s cold aspect chill it?  
Did thy wayward passions quell it?  
Did unkindness quench its ray?  
Harold! Let thy bosom say!  
Yes! that breast has been my pillow,  
Yet the treach’rous wound it gave  
As the smooth deceitful billow  
Wrecks the bark that trusts its wave,  
Envy’s dire forebodings slighting  
Deaf alike to friendship’s voice;  
Pride elating — hope delighting,  
*I alone* was Harold’s choice.  
Sad distinction! dear bought glory  
Was that heart’s unstable prize!  
Now the theme of gossip’s story,  
Thus expos’d to vulgar eyes.  
Yet ’twas not the foul illusion  
Fame’s bright halo round thee spread  
Other dreams of dear delusion  
Faith and young affection led.  
Not a suppliant world around me  
Could have lured me from thy side  
No! the tender bands that bound me  
Hands, *but thine*, could ne’er divide.

“But ’tis done” — the arm that held me  
Late the cherish’d gift of Heav’n,  
Now unclasps no more to shield me  
And — but no! — thou art forgiv’n  
Never can the heart forget thee  
Which has felt a love like mine;  
Nor our smiling Infant let me  
While she bears those eyes of thine.  
Ah farewell! — farewell for ever!  
Once in happiest hours we met,  
Now with blasted hopes we sever  
Soon our Sun of Joy has set.  
Who that felt the desolation  
Of the earthquake’s dreadful reign,  
She would choose the same foundation  
For their peaceful bow’r again!
