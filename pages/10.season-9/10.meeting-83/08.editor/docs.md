Brother Editor,  

As it is the fashion to publish poems on domestic circumstances, I have obtained two written (it is said) by two bridegrooms. The first betrays the doubtful and metaphysical spirit of your melancholy friend Beauclerc; the other has the elegant case and vivacity of his fashionable rival. As Sir Pertinax Townly seldom claims more than a purchased right to poetry, I have published the sprightly trifle signed P. without enquiring to whom it really belongs; but shall only venture to send Mr B’s to your Chest as licence to print is refused by him to

Your Friend and Correspondent

I expect a third from Windermere

Spirit beyond the world’s control,  
&emsp;What art thou, Happiness! and where?  
Thou, pure and viewless as the soul,  
&emsp;Canst only with the soul compare. 

Thy shape, thy presence, and thy place    
&emsp;We doubt, yet thy existence feel;    
Thought cannot fix nor Reason trace    
&emsp;The glances which thy throne reveal!

Thou are like Beauty, for no tongue  
&emsp;Thy mystic essence can explain;  
Thou art like Time, for Time is dumb  
&emsp;And has no trace till trace is vain. 
		
Like Beauty and like Time thou fliest  
&emsp;Thyself of Beauty’s train a part;  
Yet not like Time; for tho’ thou diest,  
&emsp;Hope may recall thee to the heart. 
		
He knows thee not who strives to tell  
&emsp;Thy secret feast to babbling Fame:  
No eloquence with thee can dwell —   
&emsp;Scarce language yet affords thy name. 
		
In one pure beam of seeming white  
&emsp;The rainbow’s richest hues we find;  
And thou, the Soul’s unsullied light,  
&emsp;Art ev’ry ray from heav’n combin’d.

Spirit beyond the world’s control  
&emsp;Hear, if you canst, a mortal’s pray’r!  
Be mute, be secret as his soul,  
&emsp;But keep thy holy mansion there!

If I swear by that eye you’ll allow  
Its looks are so shifting and new  
That the oath I may take on it now  
The very next glance would undo.  

The Cupids that sit there so sly  
Such different arrows have got  
That an oath on the glance of an eye  
Like yours, may be off in a shot.  

Should I swear by the dew on thy lip  
Tho’ each moment the treasure renews,  
If my constancy wishes to trip  
I may sip off the oath when I choose!  

Or a sigh may disperse from that flow’r  
Both the dew and the oath that are there;  
And I’d make a new vow ev’ry hour  
To lose it so sweetly in air.  

But clear up the heav’n of thy brow  
Nor fancy my oath but a feather;  
On my heart I will pledge thee my vow —   
They both must be broken together!
