My first like my second, not easily tamed  
Would vex the best monarch in history famed  
My second a monarch himself in the field  
To force far inferior is oft forced to yield.  
But my whole were a monster in Britain if shown  
Where a free constitution makes harmless the throne  
Where my second the emblem of all that is great,  
Will shield from destruction of Europe the fate.
