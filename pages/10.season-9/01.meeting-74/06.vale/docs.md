When the dread summons of an English king  
Bade Cambria’s rocks with startled echoes ring  
Her native bard in freedom’s latest pride  
Spoke Edward’s doom and triumphed ere he died  
Told our his sorrows and proclaimed his curse  
In the last accents of his mountain verse;  
Laid his loved harp on Snowdon’s parent brow  
Then leaped indignant to the flood below:  
Yet mid his patriot rage, the plaintive moan  
Of parting friendship lent its softer tone  
Hushed the high theme of Cambria’s mortal throes;  
One last fond tribute dying nature pays  
To the last partners of his happier days —   
Again, again ye tender scenes of farewell  
Ye lonely bowers where green-robed dryads dwell  
Where bounteous nature every charm arrayed  
To grace the paradise which here she made  
Adieu my home where many a day has passed  
In dreams too fond, too flattering far to last;  
Where hope and friendship decked the woody glade  
With flowers I fondly thought too sweet to fade;  
Where not a care disturbed my blissful rest  
To mar the sunshine of a cloudless breast.

And thou the monarch[^1] of the stripling band,  
Who swayest thy sceptre with a parent’s hand;  
Feared, yet beloved, beneath whose watchful care  
The flowers of genius bloom and flourish there  
If ere my humble muse engaged thy praise  
Accept her last, her tributary lays.  

Thou too[^2], whose friendship is my joy and pride,  
Whose virtues warm, whose precepts yet shall guide,  
Whose kind instruction taught my infant hand,  
To weave fresh garlands in a fairy land  
Who soaked within my heart a poet’s fire,  
Cheered its faint zeal, and lent the Latin lyre;  
Life’s busy din invades its classic swell  
The tender cadence gone, and hushed the tuneful shell.  

So when sad Israel’s sons in captive day  
Mourned for a long lost home and far away  
When cheerless rose to them each morning sun,  
That gilt the towers of foreign Babylon;  
Reckless around their idle harps were hung  
Their strains forgotten and the chords unstrung  
For vain would minstrel’s art or touch command  
The mother notes to charm a stranger land.  
Yet should with thee some child of classic vein  
With abler hand attune its chords again  
Then think of him who once had tuned it too  
And joyed to owe the art and touch to you  
And ye my friends farewell! not loved in vain  
Who shared my bliss and lulled to sleep my pain  
Where’er I wander shall I think of you  
And ask but this, to be remembered too;  
Still shall I fondly think on every hour  
Of sportive joyance in the classic bower;  
Think on your love so oft, so kindly shown,  
No feeling checked, no separate interest known.  
Where no rank feuds disturbed our peaceful reign,  
When shall I meet such friend, such hours again?  

Hush! dark forebodings, hush! ’tis mine to tell  
The worth, the love of those I priz’d so well;  
Let Fate embitter every future joy  
Mem’ry has comforts she can ne’er destroy:  
And shall not I to memory’s summons true  
Oft of fair Eton snatch a fond review?  
With filial interest count how many an age  
Has marked her greatness in the historic page  
With filial pride survey her later fame  
In Chatham’s, Fox’s, and in Wellesley’s name.  
Yes Eton raise thy hand, thy children see,  
Worthy their country still, and worthy tee;  
Still proud with England’s, Eton’s name to bear,  
They boast the nurse’s with the mother’s care  
And Ah! could hope in hurried dreams inspire  
My humble breast with imitative fire  
Nurse of my youth, yet suffer me to prove  
One glance of something like paternal love  
One kindred smile to approve the bold essay  
And look to cheer me on my venturous way;  
For sadly from thee turns my onward view,  
My heart is with thee still — adieu! adieu!
