**M**&hairsp;us is Latin for Mouse, Puss is English for Cat,  
**A**&hairsp;nd so it goes on, that for this, this for that,  
**R**&hairsp;ight or wrong, up and down, here and there, high or low,  
**Y**&hairsp;ou view as relations, and vary the show.  

**A**&hairsp;lexander the Great was a Conquering King,  
**L**&hairsp;illiputian Princes could do no such thing,  
**E**&hairsp;els and Elephants would not assort in a ring.  
**X**&hairsp;enobia reign’d in the grandest hubbub  
**I**&hairsp;nstead fam’d Diogenes lived in a tub,  
**N**&hairsp;o extreme or excess suits the body or mind,  
**A**&hairsp;ll that’s good in a narrower compass we find.  

**C**&hairsp;ontented is wealth, tis the wealth of the soul,  
**A**&hairsp;nd disposes its treasures from pole unto pole,  
**M**&hairsp;ore precious than gems or the ores that we view  
**P**&hairsp;our’d forth from Golconda, Potosi, Peru  
**B**&hairsp;e pious, be moral, be courteous, be just,  
**E**&hairsp;mbracing all virtues, as holding in trust,  
**L**&hairsp;earn by rule and example to chasten your breast,  
**L**&hairsp;et Providence govern and sanction the rest.
