From one who though not intimate in the family wishes to contribute to the Attic Chest, and who would be happy at some future time (when properly introduced) to make one in the circle at the Readings.

P.

“Now while charm’s circles round you close  
Of smiling belles, and rhyming beaux,  
Whilst all with eager looks contend  
Their wit or worth to recommend  
Still let your mild yet piercing eyes,  
Impartially adjudge the prize.”
