At Ellen’s birth fair Nature smil’d  
And claim’d her for his darling child,  
The sweetest treasures of the Earth  
Were open’d all to grace her birth;  
Around the cradle where she lay  
The Muses sand a roundelay  
While golden Phoebus from the sky  
Look’d with a bright auspicious eye:  
And thus to Nature who the babe caressed  
Spake his high will, his gen’rous wish expressed,  
“Let me, fair Dame, your pleasing office share  
“Be this sweet nursling still our mutual care,  
“By you, while blooming in her earliest youth  
“Be led in paths of innocence and truth,  
“And should she early own Apollo’s pow’r  
“And tuneful seek the Muse’s fav’rite bow’r,  
“I’ll be her guide whene’er she moves along  
“And lead her through the flow’ry land of song;  
“Thus following Nature and by Genius led  
“My laurel mix’d with flowers, shall grace her head.”
