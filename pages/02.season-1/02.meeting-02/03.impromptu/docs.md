#### On a man of Genius who suddenly became *bald*

Be consol’d my dear friend, though your fate is so bare,  
You make up in brains what is wanting in hair,  
Which confirms what is said, by the learned no doubt,  
That a rich mine of gold has no without;  
We shall therefore infer your bald nob was design’d  
As a gnomon, to point out the wealths in your *mind*.  

#### On the late learned Professor

When P --- n the learned escap’d from the clay,  
His soul stagger’d up to the bright realms of day  
Where accosting fair Hebe, he swore like a Lector  
He’d ne’er stir day nor night ’till he’d drunk all her nectar.  
She replied with a look of ineffable grace,  
While the roses fresh bloom’d with the smile on her face  
Take the licence my friend — keep the secret between us,  
Now reel down & for ever get drunk with Silenus.  

P.
