<span data-tippy="Nor let" class="green">Let not</span> soft slumbers close your eyes  
Before you’ve recollected thrice  
The train of actions thro’ the day:  
Where have my feet chose out the way?  
What have I learnt, where’er I’ve been,  
From all I’ve heard from all I’ve seen?  
What know I more that’s worth the knowing?  
What have I done that’s worth the doing?  
What have I sought that I should shun?  
What duty have I left undone;  
Or into what new follies run?  
These self inquiries are the road  
That leads to virtue and to God.
