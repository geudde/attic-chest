Much do I wish to send in rhyme  
Some kindly wish & à that  
And truly I have known the time  
I’ve tried Parnassian heights to climb  
And sometimes hit the jingling chime  
At New Years day and à that.  
  
But now the knack I fear I’ve lost  
To verify and à that  
For I believe the winters frost  
Has à my fine intentions crost  
And made me dull as any frost  
Yet I shall write for à that.  
  
And I will wish you Bardic dear  
In truth & faith and à that  
To live in peace for many a year  
That grief may never wring a tear  
But Love to dry it may be near  
And cheer your heart and à that.
