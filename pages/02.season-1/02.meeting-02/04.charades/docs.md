#### 1

My first though your House from the thief it defends,  
&emsp;Like a knave or a cheat you abuse and despise,  
My second though small yet alas comprehends  
&emsp;All the good, all the great, all the learnâ€™d all the wise.  
Of my third I have little or nothing to say  
Except that it marks the departure of day.  

#### 2

My first is the lot which is destined by fate  
For my second to meet with in every state  
My whole is by many philosophers reckoned  
To bring very often my first to my second.
