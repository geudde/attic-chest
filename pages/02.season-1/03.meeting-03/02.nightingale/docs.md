Songstress of the rural scene  
When moonbeam’s cheer the distant grot  
Oft at Ev’nings hour serene  
Delight me with thy dulcet note!  
Around, the flow’ring shrubs befriend  
Where no rude Urchin hurls the sling  
My Pines shall Philomel defend  
Sweet bird then unmolested sing.  
Thy tones the pensive joys prepare  
That innocence and peace approve.  
Begone dejection — sombre care  
Content’s the inmate of the grove  
Come then sweet Bird and hither — bring   
Tranquility, and Nature’s blooming spring.
