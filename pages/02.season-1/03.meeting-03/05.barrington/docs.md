> On His Birthday  —  Dec 8th 1808
  
That ghastly being long and spare  
(So Parnel paints the villain care)  
Which Horace tells and tells you true  
Fly where you may, will still pursue  
Ascend the deck and spread the sail  
He follows in the favouring gale  
And fleeter than the favouring wind  
Your courser mount, He mounts behind.  
  
This wretch, the child of want and fear  
Has been my torment many a year  
Has broke my rest with fearful dreams  
Obscured Apollo’s golden beams  
Embrown’d the verdant vernal plain  
Untuned the lark and linnet’s strain  
Has made the woodbine and the rose  
For sweets a noisome fume disclose  
And ta’en from natures cheerful face  
Its richest hues its sweetest grace  
The Muses, lovely froward fair  
Detest this scowling caitiff care  
And fly my humble roof since he  
Has dwelt, a hated guest! with me;  
But wanting now a birthday song  
I call’d so loud, and call’d so long  
They came — They coldly heard my prayer  
And cast a sneering look on care.  
Again I sued, What spleen pervades  
Your bosom’s dear enchanting maids?  
Have you forgot the youthful hours  
I loitered in your mystic bowers  
When midnight darkness gloom’d the skies  
And sleep was banished from mine eyes  
To hear the tales you sweetly told  
Of lovely nymphs and warriors bold.  
How liberal then was every dame  
Of matchless verse and endless fame  
Now each denies when age comes on  
To give one line for Barrington.  
  
The bounteous Lord of Swainston grove  
Said Clio, All the Muses love  
For him unbidden verse they bring  
For him with willing voices sing  
Derived from either regal rose  
His blood in streams unsullied flows  
And every movement of his mind  
Shews honour in his breast enshrin’d.  
  
This day — the day that give him birth  
Shall friendship consecrate to mirth  
Call round his hearth the social powers  
That crown with joy the festive hours,  
And though that snarling caitiff there  
Forbids thy verse to greet his ear  
Yet Hayter’s unaffected lays  
Shall yield the mead of honest praise:  
But know no praises can impart  
Such transport to his liberal heat  
As yon fair group of blooming maids —  
I see them burst from Calborne shades  
Joy swells their father’s breast, and joy  
Gleams in their beauteous mother’s eye  
While they with filial reverence bend  
To him their uncle guardian friend.  
There with another lively band  
From sea-beat Osborne’s sylvan strand  
With many a youth of naval name  
And soldiers yet unknown to fame  
Beat with brisk steps the echoing ground  
And weave the dances mazy round  
While age with young delight looks on  
And thinks of years long past and gone  
And every feeling bosom there  
Spontaneous breathes a grateful prayer  
That heaven their Barrington may bless  
With life and health and happiness.  
  
She spoke — His rugged front the while  
Grim care relax’d and forc’d a smile  
By Clio’s gentle accents chear’d  
He bad me sing the song I’d heard  
But ill my feeble powers retain   
And ill my tongue repeats the strain  
Else Barrington my plausive rhyme  
Would scorn the envious rage of time  
And to unnumber’d ages prove  
They virtues & my grateful love.
