Written on hearing an amiable young lady who sang with taste & feeling but who wanted strength of voice.

When Sappho — fair enthusiast! sung  
&emsp;&emsp;To Lesbian youth their groves among  
Rapt with her theme she swept the lyre  
&emsp;&emsp;And fann’d each bosoms latent fire.
	
Her hurried hand wild love impell’d  
&emsp;&emsp;Her voice tumultuous passion swell’d  
Each thrilling pulse new measures beat  
&emsp;&emsp;And *exil’d reason fled her seat*.
	
But list’ning to *thy milder* strains  
&emsp;&emsp;No madd’ning tides distend the veins  
Thy lips no opiate sounds dispense  
&emsp;&emsp;To lull or steal the prostrate sense.

Ah no! a nobler task is thine  
&emsp;&emsp;In giving song its first design  
With music’s pow’r to join thine own  
&emsp;&emsp;And charm our reason on her throne.
	
Timanthes
