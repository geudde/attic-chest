> Written on hearing an Amiable Young Lady who sang with taste & feeling but who wanted strength of voice.

When Sappho — fair enthusiast! sung  
&emsp;&emsp;To Lesbian youth their groves among  
Rapt with her theme she swept the Lyre  
&emsp;&emsp;And fann’d each bosoms latent fire.
	
Her hurried hand wild Love impell’d  
&emsp;&emsp;Her voice tumultuous passion swell’d  
Each thrilling pulse new measures beat  
&emsp;&emsp;And *exil’d reason fled her seat*.
	
But list’ning to *thy milder* strains  
&emsp;&emsp;No madd’ning Tides distend the veins  
Thy lips no Opiate sounds dispense  
&emsp;&emsp;To lull or steal the prostrate sense.

Ah no! a nobler task is thine  
&emsp;&emsp;In giving song its first design  
With Music’s pow’r to join thine own  
&emsp;&emsp;And charm our reason on her throne.
