Far, far unbosom’d in an *eastern* vale  
&emsp;Shaded by myrtle groves there stands a bow’r  
Fanned ever by the gentle western gale  
&emsp;The house of Parliament for every flow’r  
  
There each deputed loveliest of its kind,  
&emsp;In all its summer glory comes arrayed;  
To represent the race it left behind,  
&emsp;And sit securely in the friendly shade.  
  
There every flower that drinks the dew of morn,  
&emsp;Or hails with opening sweets th’ approach of light;  
There every shrub that does the Earth adorn,  
&emsp;In Senate meet th’ enraptured gazer’s sight.  
  
One day assembled by the Lily fair,  
&emsp;In consultation all the Flow’rets met;  
He rising with a mild but stately air,  
&emsp;Commenced th’ important business of debate.  
  
“Children of Flora now assembled here,  
&emsp;Ye lovely fav’rites of indulgent heaven,  
To whom o’er other tribes without compeer,  
&emsp;The charms of beauty, and of scent are given.”  
  
“From Zephyrus ye sure e’er this have heard,  
&emsp;What all the brute creation *are about*  
How ev’ry insect, quadruped, or bird  
&emsp;Of any note, has given a feast or rout.”  
  
“How first the Grasshopper or Butterfly,  
&emsp;With their fine feasts and balls the mode began,  
How through the birds e’en to the chattering pie,  
&emsp;With added forces the vain infection can:”  
  
“How next the quadrupeds their art assay’d;  
&emsp;The Elephant his routs began *to give*,  
He sanctioned by a *royal* masquerade  
&emsp;Attended by each beast of ton *alive*.”  
  
“The fishes gala next attracts our eye,  
&emsp;Where sportive Nereids wreaths of sea flow’rs wove,  
Where Neptune on his throne of majesty,  
&emsp;Sate in the shade of his own coral grove.”  
  
“Now since my honourable friends ’tis ours  
&emsp;Selected by the people’s fav’ring voice,  
To guide the actions of the race of flow’rs,  
&emsp;Now let us prove we’re worthy of their choice.”  
  
“The Flowers impatient wish a Fete to give  
&emsp;And wait the sanction of our mighty name,  
Yet shall my friends the floral honour live  
&emsp;But by a dance or rout reveal’d to fame,”  
    
“Things that are noble are the work of one  
&emsp;With us the <span data-tippy="fashion" class="green">custom</span> dies if we ordain  
No honour ’tis *to do* what all *have done*  
&emsp;<span data-tippy="The last supporters of her falling train" class="green">The last support of fashion’s galling train</span>.”  
  
“But if we as the Peers of Flora’s state,  
&emsp;Decree nor feast, nor rout, nor Call to give,  
Then shall our nation be more truly great,  
&emsp;Renown’d for temperance, our name shall live.”  
  
He spoke and sat; from all the floral kind  
&emsp;A gentle murmur of applause arose,  
Like that when ruffled by the Western wind  
&emsp;With speed encreas’d the purple oceans flows.  
  
The next arose the Everlasting Sea,  
&emsp;<span data-tippy="Constant" class="green">The firm</span> supporter of his noble friend;  
With air of mingle grace and dignity,  
&emsp;That bade in silence all his speech attend.  
    
“My friend, *who spoke the last*,” he thus began,  
&emsp;“Has chose a theme that must attention claim  
A subject near concerning every one,  
&emsp;Who has an interest in the floral fame.”  
  
“And sure I think more honour will *derive*  
&emsp;*On* us, on all the Peers of Flora’s State,  
If our majority decree to *give*,  
&emsp;Nor masquerade, nor ball, nor rout, nor fete.”  
  
He spoke with grace that much attention found.  
&emsp;The Poppy next his beauteous form display’d,  
This robe was white with crimson fring’d around[^1]  
&emsp;And crown’d with sable stamina his head.  
  
Fair was his form, majestic as he rose,  
&emsp;(His figure would have grac’d the floral dance)  
But used to cover with alluring glaze  
&emsp;Whatever tenets he might e’er advance.  
    
“My friends and shall the lordly Lily find  
&emsp;Your prompt support in this his task,” he cried  
“O! view the question with impartial mind,  
&emsp;And having view’d it competent decide.”  
  
“Shall each ignoble butterfly or beast,  
&emsp;Present but late at their respective ball,  
Think us unable to direct a feast,  
&emsp;No ’twere disgraceful to the flow’rets all.”  
  
“And shall they boast that we a vulgar race  
&emsp;To equal them e’en dare not to aspire,  
Content in silence, fearful of disgrace,  
&emsp;Their taste and wit to envy and admire.”  
  
“Ah no my honourable friends! your worth  
&emsp;Here must not slumber, rather at the call  
Of fair occasion draw your talents forth;  
&emsp;Devise some fete more new than feast or ball.”  
  
“Then shall your honour hide their rising fame,  
&emsp;As brighter Cynthea each surrounding star;  
Then! then! shall poets sing the floral name,  
&emsp;And with their own your praise shall spread afar.”  
  
He spoke, and thus the Lily fair replied  
&emsp;“Have you forgot my friend, each bird or beast  
With all their arrogance, & pomp, & pride,  
&emsp;Have always needed us to deck their feast.”  
  
“The Peacock when he gave his famous rout,  
&emsp;Implor’d th’ assistance of full many a flower  
The Rose decked all the bushes round about  
&emsp;The Woodbine drest the variegated bower.”  
  
“The Nymphea alba for the fishes wove  
&emsp;Their wreaths and round the lucid columns twin’d;  
Or the transparent throne, where in his grove  
&emsp;<span data-tippy="Majestic" class="green">The mighty</span> Neptune then his limbs reclin’d.”  
  
“Whatever fete we give, will they not say  
&emsp;It is an imitation of their own  
And ’tis a fashion of which I should say  
&emsp;The breach gives honour, the observance none.”  
  
“I do not wish your suffrages to guide,  
&emsp;Or let my name convince a single Peer.  
Upon the case impartially decide  
&emsp;Then let the Nation that decision hear”  
  
The Speaker Hollyhock bids the house divide.  
&emsp;The Acapanthus, fragrant Mignionetter,  
And his own brethren with the Lily side,  
&emsp;The Peas, the Pinks and the Carnation sweet.  
  
And all the Roses. For the Poppy gay  
&emsp;Vote his own tribe, the bright Sweet Williams too,  
The Sunflower who pursues the source of day,  
&emsp;Coxcombs and many a flower of gaudy hue.  
  
The rest I know not: but the most declare  
&emsp;Their wish does with the Lily coincide,  
Which much surprised the Poppy gay and fair  
&emsp;Who thought they needs must for the Dance decide.
