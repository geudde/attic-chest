See where yon stately Lily grows  
&emsp;In robe of spotless white arrayed  
The pride of Flora’s court it blows  
&emsp;Fair emblem of a virtuous maid.  
  
Those gaudy flowers that round it bloom  
&emsp;Unnoticed by are quickly past  
Upon their their tints or their perfume  
&emsp;A moment’s thought is scarely cast.  
  
So towering o’er her kindred fair  
&emsp;Laurette’s blooming beauties rise  
Robes of prismatic hues they wear  
&emsp;In virgin white she meets our eyes  
  
Lo, in this spotless garb we find  
And emblem of her spotless mind.
