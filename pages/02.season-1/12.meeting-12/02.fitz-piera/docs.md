> A parody on that truly sublime and pathetic elegy entitled  
  
#### “Fitz-Pieria’s gone to pot.”  
  
Let every nymph be melancholy  
&emsp;And each bystander fret:  
For he who once was blithe and jolly,  
&emsp;Fitz-Pieria’s *ta’en* the *pet.*  
  
We’ll raise in this unhallowed spot,  
&emsp;A monumental store,  
And there expressive of his lot  
&emsp;These line we’ll grave upon.  
  
Let every nymph be melancholy  
&emsp;And each bystander fret:  
For he who once was blithe and jolly,  
&emsp;Fitz-Pieria’s *ta’en* the *pet.*  
  
Let this sad stone her tears distill,  
&emsp;A briny fountain pure  
Which shall collecting form a will,  
&emsp;That flows with pace demure.  
  
Let every nymph be melancholy  
&emsp;And each bystander fret:  
For he who once was blithe and jolly,  
&emsp;Fitz-Pieria’s *ta’en* the *pet.*
