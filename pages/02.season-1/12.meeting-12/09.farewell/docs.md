It is now the pleasing duty of the Editor and Editress of the Attic Chest to make their grateful acknowledgements to their kind correspondents for their respective favours. Favours which have done as much honour to themselves as they have given pleasure to those who attended their reading. Few societies we believe can be found which can exhibit such a number of original pieces in so short a time and with such a variety of excellence. The compositions of Hassan and Timanthes are peculiarly distinguished by elegance of language and delicacy of sentiment, qualities of a permanent nature that flash not ostentatiously on the eye; but are never perceived without delight. It will not be easy to produce a poem of more original wit and humour than that signed Fitz Pieria which we regret is still left unfinished. Nor a <span data-tippy="human" class="green">humanly</span> tale more complete than The Constellation though its versification is rude and unpolished] its spirit is evidently derived from the Muses Vagaries. The Jarvey, The verses on Sir John Barringtonâ€™s Birthday, The translation and imitations of Anacreon and several of the small poems have distinctive and characteristic merit. Even those ephemeral productions denominated Valentines. The Contributors to the Attic Chest have shewn that a subject is never trite in the hands of genius and one and all have displayed talents that when more exercised will secure more extensive fame.

We now beg leave to request that our friends will be pleased to acknowledge their compositions that honour be paid where honour is due.

The Society will then be dissolved and when we part with wishes for a pleasurable summer and with hopes that new ideas will be collected and arranged for our mutual entertainment when again we assemble round the Attic Chest.
