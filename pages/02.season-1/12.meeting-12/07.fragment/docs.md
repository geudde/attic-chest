The yellow grain  
Nods to the main  
As Notus sweeps the seagirt plain,  
And now he sleeps  
With all his boisterous brethren on the undisturbed deep.  
  
Yon purpling cloud declares the way  
Of the rising God of day,  
Whose golden hair and steeds atherial bright  
In full refulgent blaze  
Diffuse their circling rays  
And fill the world with light.  
  
He rising high pursues his road  
Along the bright abode  
By fleecy ram, and lowing bull and skipping goat,  
And all those starry splendours nigh  
Through the blue concave of the sky.  
  
Thus from Year to Year  
Returning in his long career  
To mortal man  
He brings thy natal day again.  
  
As the sun rises from the dark Cerulian main  
Dazzling a wide worldâ€™s wondering eyes.
