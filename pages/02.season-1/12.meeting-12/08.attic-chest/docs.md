> The Attic Chest, to her contributors and friends  
  
Adieu, the dreaded hour is come  
Too well my fears foretold my doom  
We part for summer, blyth and gay  
Calls you to taste his sweets away  
Waiting in vain your wished return  
For many a week your Chest shall mourn  
While you on hill or flowry dale  
The richly scented breeze inhale  
Or free from care serene repose  
In bowers of jasmine or of rose  
Without one ray of cheering light  
To pierce the dusky veil of night  
Here shall I rest, unseen, unknown,  
Unheeded sigh unheeded moan  
Yet ah, attend the sole request  
Of your unhappy Attic Chest  
Oh in you memory’s tablet still  
A place let my remembrance fill  
Oh do not let my classic name  
Oh do not let my former fame  
Sink in oblivion’s silent stream  
But buoyed by you still let it ride  
And stem secure the fatal tide  
And then when summer shall decay  
And richer autumn fade away  
And winter o’er the year shall reign  
Then shall my hopes revive again  
Yes I will hail his icy brow  
Will welcome frost will welcome snow  
Adieu, may you till then enjoy  
The cup unmixed of health and joy.
