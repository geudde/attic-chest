We this day have to present our auditors with a poem entitled the “Floral Senate” which we hope will be heard with pleasure for its elegance though we are sorry that the desire of the author to exhibit it at the close of our session has induced him to send it before his plan is completed. We hail it however as the prelude to a work that may be preserved in our album with the compositions of our most distinguished contributors. The Burlesque Elegy by Anti Cypressa on Fitz-Pieria may excite a smile. The sonnet by Sophia, and the stanzas entitled “Flattery rejected” are both worthy of the Attic Chest by their moral meaning.
