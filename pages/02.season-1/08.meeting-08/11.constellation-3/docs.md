They entered, they dined, and when dinner was over  
His adventures, Roberto began to discover  
And when he had fully his history displayed  
Respecting the moon some enquiries he made.  
And from all that he learnt, it appeared, that tho’ less,  
As a world like our own, we that orb must confess.  
By this time o’er the moon, Night her curtain had drawn  
While the tenants of earth, hail’d the presence of  <span data-tippy="morn" class="green">dawn</span>  
And our orb, to Roberto’s delight and surprise  
Appeared like the moon, tho’ superior in size  
Our traveller determined he’d rest until day  
And when morning appeared, would proceed on his way  
For the *Moonite* had told him that when he had past  
The shadow in space by the moon that was cast  
That the sun would forever unclouded appear  
And by night uncontrolled, day his journey would cheer.  
  
His advise likewise was and th’event prov’d it good  
That he with him should take a small portion of food  
He agreed, and some beef was put up in a basket  
With a large piece of tongue, and of wine a full flasket  
This prepared, they retired, but scarce had the sun  
Next morning his journey diurnal begun  
Ere Roberto arose, his acknowledgements made  
To the man of the moon for his unlooked-for aid  
Then mounted his horse and flew up, with surprise  
The Moonite observed them progressively rise  
Till the clouds of the moon hid them both from his eyes.  
Meanwhile upward and upward Roberto still rode  
Letting Pegasus choose out thro’ Æther his road  
At last *he* when arrived near the stars, far above  
Caught glimpse of the mansion eternal of Jove  
And our traveller gay, thought it now was high time  
To try on the saddle his hand at a rhyme  
And thus on the scene which he saw and admired  
Roberto began, by the saddle inspired.  
  
He longer had sung, but a meteor that past  
A reflexion malignant on Pegasus cast  
In the midst of the stars the poor steed frighted fell  
There remained, but Roberto fared not quite so well  
From the saddle he fell, unsupported by aught,  
Passed thro’ the dominions of space quick as thought  
’Gainst a planet he came with a horrible bump  
And split it in quarters, so great was the thump.  
And falling still downwards and downwards full soon  
Roberto arrived once again in the moon.  
Yea, more he arrived in that valley, that’s named  
By Ariosto the Poet far famed  
Where all thing that are lost upon Earth my be found,  
Our traveller felt himself well, safe and sound  
For his fall had been broke by a legion of sighs,  
And of vows that from Earth did but lately arise  
(The proffers of love on St. Valentine made)  
And his own very kindly had lent him their aid.  
  
Roberto at first was well pleased with his fate  
And saw many wonders I will not relate  
But coming at last ’mongst the jars full of wit  
Upon one of the largest his own name was writ  
When he lost it, you ladies perhaps may enquire  
It *was* when he quitted the moon to fly higher  
And as Ariosto had told him the way,  
He regained it, then ’mongst the jars further did stray  
He expected the wits of young men to find there  
For ’tis said that they lose them. on viewing the fair  
But you, gentle readers, must judge his surprise  
When scarce any of these met *his* curious eyes  
*British generals* there very frequently abound  
There Whitelock’s, Dalrymple’s, and Burrard’s are found.  
There Pagets and <span data-tippy="Mack’s" class="green">Moore’s</span>, and Clavering’s appeared,  
And a certain *great personnage* too I have heard.
