Of old, as poets tell the tale  
The knight went arm’d in coat of *mail*  
And as to battle, forth he pac’d,  
Like hog-in-armour snugly cas’d,  
Though soundly thump’d and roughly shaken  
His armour always sav’d *his bacon*.  
  
Our modern ensign of the guards  
The iron coat, and helm discards,  
But that no knight may him surpass,  
His lack of *steel* supplies in *brass*.  
  
The *mail* at first in humble flight,  
On one poor hack rode day & night;  
At Damon’s silence, Delia wonder’d,  
Nor guess’d both mail and steed had founder’d,  
Weigh’d down with many a heavy line,  
That hail’d the morn of Valentine.  
  
So to relieve the anxious swain  
From all he felt of am’rous pain,  
They cramm’d the tender, moving lays  
In pocket of a one-horse-chaise.  
  
The mail then ris’n to higher state,  
Assum’d “the livery of the great” —  
And right he should; for in his hands,  
From Sandgate’s or from Weymouth’s sands  
He wafts the royal hero’s sighs  
To Mrs Clark’s bewitching eyes,  
In lines that to laughing senates prove,  
The power of “*dearest, dearest love*;”  
And shew that our great chieftain writes  
With all the *spirit* that he fights —  
  
&emsp;For this, like lightning as he goes  
&emsp;His stunning horn unceasing blows,  
&emsp;With *royal* guard the mail is grac’d —
