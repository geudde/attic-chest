What if the Gods their Tributes brought,  
To fill the box of fam’d Pandora;  
Behold! with equal treasures fraught,  
Thy precious Casket — Eleanora!  
  
More favour’d than that fatal Chest —  
Not to this consecrated Coffer,  
By Virtue, and by Genius blest,  
One Gift shall Vice or Folly offer.  
  
Phoebus, whose summer glory plays  
Around the Charriot of Aurora;  
Now gilds with intellectual rays,  
Thy sacred Chest, Oh Eleanora!  
  
The Bird whose eye shuns vulgar light,  
Unerring darts thro’ shades nocturnal;  
Here charged to bend his secret flight,  
With Wisdom’s characters supernal.  
  
Here shall the Doves of Venus bring  
The emblematic Gifts of Flora;  
And bid stern Winter smile like Spring,  
To grace the Chest of Eleanora.  
  
Lo! as her guardian fingers ope  
The Lid, each mystic Leaf that covers;  
Around th’ ideal Buds, soft Hope  
Flutt’ring like vernal Zephyr hovers!
