What if the Gods their tributes brought,  
To fill the box of fam’d Pandora;  
Behold! with equal treasures fraught,  
Thy precious casket — Eleanora!  
  
More favour’d than that fatal Chest —  
Not to this consecrated coffer,  
By virtue, and by genius blest,  
One gift shall vice or folly offer.  
  
Phoebus, whose summer glory plays  
Around the chariot of Aurora;  
Now gilds with intellectual rays,  
Thy sacred Chest, Oh Eleanora!  
  
The Bird whose eye shuns vulgar light,  
Unerring darts thro’ shades nocturnal;  
Here charged to bend his secret flight,  
With wisdom’s characters supernal.  
  
Here shall the doves of Venus bring  
The emblematic gifts of Flora;  
And bid stern winter smile like spring,  
To grace the Chest of Eleanora.  
  
Lo! as her guardian fingers ope  
The lid, each mystic leaf that covers;  
Around th’ ideal buds, soft hope  
Flutt’ring like vernal zephyr hovers!
