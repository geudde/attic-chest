<div class="author">Miss Porden</div>

Ah, me, this Attic Chest  
Allows one not a moment’s rest,  
From Delphi I to London come  
To bear the truant Muses home;  
My hapless tail too on the way,  
Must largely for the journey pay.  
And scarce arrived to my surprise,  
I’m sent a journey to the skies,  
And not enough, at other times,  
I’m prest with such a load of rhymes  
That I am growing monstrous thin,  
Indeed I’m nought but bone & skin  
Sometimes from morn till night I’m jaded  
With ponderous heroics — laded  
Or (then my Backett somewhat neater)  
I’m laden with a lighter metre  
Incessant ridden morn and night  
Till I’m in such a piteous blight  
I cannot even stand upright.
