> From the Greek  
  
> A Translation of the Forty-eighth Ode  
of Anacreon  
  
Give me Homer’s golden Lyre  
But without it’s sanguine String  
From the Altar’s holy Fire  
Here the foaming Goblet bring.  
  
Then I’ll mix the rosy Wine  
All it’s Dictates then obey  
With the laughing Chorus join  
And with temper’d Madness play.  
  
Singing to my sounding Shell  
I’ll it’s chearful Chords explore  
Chords from which none else so well  
The Strains by Wine inspir’d can pour.  
  
May 7th 1806
