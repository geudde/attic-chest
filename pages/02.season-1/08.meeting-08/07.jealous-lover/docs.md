I, at noon tide’s sultry hour,  
In a cool sequester’d bower,  
Lovely Flavia lately found  
Sleeping on the flowery Ground.  
While I feast my ravish’d eye,  
Lo! a vain and wanton fly,  
In his summer coat array’d,  
Dares to kiss the sleeping maid.  
Oft her blooming cheek he presses,  
Oft her snowy neck caresses,  
Oft, audatious! dares to sip  
Nectar from her balmy lip.  
Then, to a new blown rose now flying,  
And within its bosom lying,  
Rifles all its sweets, and then  
Flits to Flavia’s lips again,
