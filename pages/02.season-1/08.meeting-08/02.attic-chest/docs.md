All, Spring’s approach with pleasure hail  
And breathe with joy the Vernal gale  
The virgin flower that bashful blows  
Distinguished scarce from kindred snows  
The Crocus whose emboldened hues  
A glow upon the scene diffuse  
The primrose pale, with modest mien  
The violet hid in foliage green  
Th’ uncertain sunshine of the sky  
Say, “Spring is come, and Summer’s nigh”  
Joy these diffuse o’er every heart  
But these no joy to me impart.  
Too well I know, the time is near  
When I, tho’ now so much your care  
Unnoticed here for months shall lie  
While you to distant regions hie  
That power[^1] benign at whose command  
The richly-tinted flowers expand  
To North, to South, to every side  
Will bid my patron band divide  
Yet Hope soft whispers, “When his Car  
To Southern Climes shall Phoebus bear  
Then charged with many a polished strain  
Your Votaries will return again.”  

E.R.
