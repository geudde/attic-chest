’Twas about Twelve o’clock on Saint Valentines Day,  
Hermes thought that like others, he’d make holiday;  
So while Peg is saddling, he brushes his wings  
And light on his seat in a twinkling he springs.  
He said, “That till night he would ride up and down  
And view all that was worthy of sight in the town,  
And as people at that end, I’ve heard are all witty,  
I’ll just see what <span data-tippy="fun’s going on in the City" class="green">fun may be found in the City</span>.”   
<span data-tippy="Missing" class="red">[ . . . ]</span> his brisk steed on a trot,  
And who laughed at his wings, he ne’er minded a jot;  
But remembering what formerly Peg had endured,  
His tail in a neat Leather Bag he’d secured.  
’Tis needless to tell in what stile he did dash on,  
Through Bond Street, whose loungers admired the new fashion;  
And each Knight of the Whip gave his orders for wings,  
And thought, spite of shew, they’d be nice useful things;  
But they all were unlucky, each shopman declared,  
Of such things till then, he, alas had ne’er heard.  
Young and old all round Hermes were laden with letters  
And each heart that he saw was fast bound in love’s fetters  
Some by his darts were so pierced, that they bled  
Till they spotted the papers, they carried, with red!  
Poor Mercury cried, as he heaved a deep sigh  
“I’ve no Valentine now, that I’m not in the sky;  
How will dear Hebe forgive the omission  
But she must when she know ’twas thro’ Phoebus’ commission  
But I think, and I vow that the thought me amuses  
I’ll send a love letter to one of the Muses.  
But whose name shall it be in, dear me, I’m quite stupid  
<span data-tippy="Missing" class="red">[ . . . ]</span>  
It shall be from their old friend and servant  
And now I think on’t, it shall be to Thalia  
She sent me in my name, to a maid called Maria”  
When Hermes had thus on the business agreed  
He began just to think about stopping his steed  
But he found that poor Peg had gone so much astray  
That back to his lodgings he knew not the way  
So at the Tavern he comes to he stops  
And ordered directly some nice mutton chops  
As I’m hungry, said he, to eat first will be better  
I shall write more at ease and at leisure my letter  
His dinner he ate, and then called for a taper  
With some sealing wax good, some ink, pen, and paper.  
In writing his verses our friend took some time  
And was often, I’m told, sore perplexed for a rhyme  
For Fate o’er his mind her black venom distilled  
And his head with most doleful presages <span data-tippy="filled" class="green"> she filled</span>   
But at last he concluded, his letter he sealed  
(The contents, tho’ a poet, to me unrevealed)  
He called for a Porter, and I heard him say  
Ask plenty for porterage, ’tis Valentines day. —  
And seeing the day was now near its decline  
He put his hat on, when he’d drank off his wine  
But with sorrow and wonder, his horse he perceived  
Was flown, to the Moon, as the waiters believed  
The Rain was in torrents beginning to pour  
And the sad chance perplexed our gay traveller sore;  
Conjectures by dozens arose in his mind,  
But not one that was plausible even could find  
So repenting too late his unfortunate road  
He began to devise by what means to get home;  
He sent for a jarvey, but none could be got,  
And to stay there till morn, he perceived was his lot.  
He thought that the <span data-tippy="Peridae" class="green">Parcae</span> the chance had designed  
And to their will his actions reluctant resigned  
So at tea we will leave him, and briefly will tell  
The hard chance which to Pegasus meanwhile befell.  
  
To be concluded
