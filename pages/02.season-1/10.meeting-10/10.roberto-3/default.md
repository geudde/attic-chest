title: 'To Roberto'
---

As the poor Ostrich when by Hunters chased  
&emsp;His head within some neighbouring bush conceal’d  
Believes himself from sight securely eased  
&emsp;Tho’ by his body to the foe revealed  
  
So thus while you the Muses disown  
&emsp;Your verses make you as their fav’rite known  
But why should you reject Roberto’s name  
&emsp;Why disavow your journey to the skies  
Plunge not your genius in Oblivion’s stream  
&emsp;But let your verses meet our Attic eyes  
The Muses fav’rite and the loved of heaven  
Are titles rarely to a Mortal given.  
Yet fear lest you the damsel’s rage provoke  
&emsp;And cause them to withdraw their heaven by fire  
Think you they’ll favour those, who e’en in joke  
&emsp;Deny the sacred favour they inspire  
Besides how can you doubt Thalia’s aid  
&emsp;After the promises that she has made.
