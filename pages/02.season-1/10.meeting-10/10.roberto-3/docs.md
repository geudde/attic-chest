<div class="author">Miss Porden</div>

As the poor Ostrich when by hunters chased  
&emsp;His head within some neighbouring bush conceal’d  
Believes himself from sight securely eased  
&emsp;Tho’ by his body to the foe revealed  
  
So thus while you the Muses disown  
&emsp;Your verses make you as their fav’rite known  
But why should you reject Roberto’s name  
&emsp;Why disavow your journey to the skies  
Plunge not your genius in oblivion’s stream  
&emsp;But let your verses meet our Attic eyes  
The Muses fav’rite and the loved of heaven  
Are titles rarely to a mortal given.  
Yet fear lest you the damsel’s rage provoke  
&emsp;And cause them to withdraw their heaven by fire  
Think you they’ll favour those, who e’en in joke  
&emsp;Deny the sacred favour they inspire  
Besides how can you doubt Thalia’s aid  
&emsp;After the promises that she has made.  
  
The Genii of the Attic Chest

We know not good sir if by you it is noted  
But next Tuesday’s the Night to the Muses devoted  
When if from *your Castle* you’ll deign to descend  
Your presence much glee to the assembly will lend
