Vainly you try to keep concealed  
Facts by Fitz Helicon revealed  
Who has to us discovered all  
Relating to your dreadful fall  
How, while composing verses you  
The frighted courser overthrew  
How falling still with dreadful force  
You split a planet in your course  
From that your illness we derive  
And thank your *skull* you yet survive  
How you your wits lost, how attained them  
And how you used when you’d regained them  
How Muses two in lucky hour  
Saved you from angry Hermes’ power  
How Pegasus his starry station  
Now holds and forms a constellation  
How Hermes, you with friendly aid  
Upon his back to earth conveyed  
All this we know and all beside  
Respecting your aetherial ride  
And from your pen we now request  
Some verses for the Attic Chest  
And dread no more your vain excuses  
Knowing you favoured by the Muses  
Besides, if other proof without  
Your ode sublime would banish doubt  
Thro’ aether when you proudly rode  
And nearly reached great Jove’s abode  
You viewed the space thro’ which you’d flown  
On worlds innumerous looking down  
Your Muse disdained less high employment  
And sang of gods and gods’ enjoyment  
  
The Genii of the Attic Chest
