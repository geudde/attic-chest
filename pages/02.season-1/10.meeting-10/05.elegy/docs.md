> To be read with a solemn tone
  
Bring evâ€™ry Nymph a branch of Holly  
To deck this sacred spot  
For he, who once was blithe and jolly  
Fitz P. is gone to pot.  
  
And here the soul, so melancholy  
Shall sit and hoot alone  
And here shall Lampkin come with Dolly  
To sit upon a Stone.  
  
But here no naughty Boy shall play  
With marbles or with top  
And nothing but some silly Goose  
The herbage round shall crop.  
  
Then bring each Nymph a bough of Holly  
To deck this sacred Spot  
For he who once was blithe and jolly  
Fitz P. is gone to Pot.
