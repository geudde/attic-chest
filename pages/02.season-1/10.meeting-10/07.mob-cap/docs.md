> The Mob Cap — or the retort  
  
<span class="title">1</span>

Quoth Kate “I will no longer bear  
The rudeness of your jest  
Since fully I’m resolv’d to wear  
Whatever I like best.”  
  
<span class="title">2  </span>
  
“So much if you dislike my head  
&emsp;Pray look another way:  
I’m not by inclination led  
&emsp;To mind what you may say — “  

<span class="title">3  </span>
  
“I really cannot understand  
&emsp;Why you keep up this railing!  
Thank heaven, I’m not at your command  
&emsp;Nor is to yield my failing — “  
 
<span class="title">4  </span>
  
“Must I sit down the easy elf?  
&emsp;Comply with all forsooth?  
No, I’ll please no one but myself  
&emsp;And that the honest truth —”  
  
<span class="title">5  </span>
  
Nay Kate, you need not make a rout,  
&emsp;Cries Ralph, I only meant,  
Your Head and all that hangs about  
&emsp;In colours fit to paint.  
  
<span class="title">6  </span>
  
You should not thus give way to passion  
&emsp;Because I recommended  
Compliance, not with me, but fashion  
&emsp;The thing was well intended.  
  
<span class="title">7  </span>
  
Perhaps you secretly desire  
&emsp;To triumph in this boast  
“That beauty plays her warmest fire  
&emsp;When unadorned the most.”  
  
<span class="title">8  </span>
  
Be this the case, I’ll set my wit  
&emsp;And spleen some other Job on,  
And fairly own you do what’s fit  
&emsp;To keep that shabby Mob on.  
 
<span class="title">9  </span>
  
I’ll strive to view, in fancy’s spite  
&emsp;Without regret that face,  
Tho’ most ridiculous the sight,  
&emsp;Peep through a rim of lace.  
  
<span class="title">10  </span>
  
In truth ’tis but an awkward look  
&emsp;While blooming to begin,  
Like antiquated maids to brook,  
&emsp;Support, beneath your chin —  
  
<span class="title">11  </span>
  
One would have thought it time enough  
&emsp;When withering nature draws  
Towards decay, to tie that rough  
&emsp;Surcingle round your jaws  
  
<span class="title">12  </span>
  
But were it thought that to enhance  
&emsp;Your beauty ’tis designed  
Folks shrewdly might believe perchance  
&emsp;The Mob but poorly lin’d —
