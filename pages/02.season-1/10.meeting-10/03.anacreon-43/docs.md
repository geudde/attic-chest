##### To the Grasshopper

Grasshopper how I envy thee!  
Who from yonder lofty tree  
When refresh’d with wholesome dews  
Which ev’ry morn for thee renews:  
Like a monarch from the spray  
Pourest thy song the live-long day.  
Lord thou callest thyself of all  
That within thy vision fall  
What the fruitful fields produce  
Or the vine’s or olive’s juice  
Thou art still the peasant’s friend  
His labours thou dost ne’er offend.  
All mankind aye welcome thee,  
Sweet prophet of festivity:  
For thou blest harbinger dost bring  
Tiding of the approach of spring.  
While thee the Muses ever love  
Daughters of all powerful Jove,  
Phoebus on thee confers his song,  
And ranks thee his gay train among.  
Old age himself thee ne’er affrights,  
But only brings thee new delights.  
Free from all pain with wisdom fraught  
Thou lover of the tuneful thought.  
Offspring of earth, but without mortal blood,  
Thou almost art the equal of a god.
