<span class="title">An Ode  </span>
  
Thyestes’ deed, Medea’s rage  
Hateful! begone! from age to age  
Nor stain with future bloody track th’ Historic page.  
  
Still the black-veiled fury roams  
Her giant form she rears on high  
Still she whirls her blazing torch  
And in the flames & sparks are hurled  
Envy, contention, strife, confusion  
To the natives of the upper world!  
  
Now the assembly congregates  
The adamantine doors unfold  
Beryls and sapphires pave the way  
The massy portal’s burning gold  
But who the splendors of this dome shall write,  
Glories which dim poetic sight!  
Still the assembly congregates  
Like myriad motes that darken summer noons  
Like bellowing waves that rise o’er mountain tops  
And level in one watery plain beneath  
The nodding harvest, cities, temples, woods & rocks,  
To rush the immortals on from depths beneath, from earth, from air,  
Some ride on stars[^1], some comets, some bestride the vapors of the air.  
“What means this tumult now?” cried Mercury above  
How dare ye thus approach the dome of mighty Jove?”  
  
“The Winged Pegasus!” they cried aloud,  
The name of Pegasus rung thro’ the crowd  
Have ye not slaughtered him like one forsaken  
Split him like deal-boards & struck him ’mongst the stars  
Like to a side of bacon?  
And not content with this, but to compleat your riddle[^2]  
Your butchering hands bereft him of bum fiddle!  
‘Twas spite propense to gods and men  
But be assured we’ll have him down again.  
  
Swift Hermes flies to learn the sovereigns will in Ethiopean glades  
Where Jove reclines beneath convivial shades.  
His golden rod & sandals glitter o’er the seas,  
Thro’ the blue aether as he past  
His silken cloak still flutters in the blast  
Or swells upon the breeze,  
Arrived, he tells the labourings of his mighty mind  
Expectant waits the thunderer’s nod  
Having declared before the god  
The wild uproar & anger left behind.  
  
Saturnius mild replies, “O! take him down  
Glue him together  
& if he is not quite weather tight  
Still he’ll be strong enough for poetaster’s tether.”[^3]
