#### A Long & *True* Story

By many a tottering nurse is known  
&emsp;The legend of the Cock-Lane Ghost;  
How it would rumble, sigh, and groan,  
&emsp;And ’mid the platters rule the roast.  

Great was the fear this ghost produc’d,  
&emsp;’Mong children small & children great,  
Till its importance was reduc’d  
&emsp;By Gardner’s ghost without a pate! [^1]  

Yet ghosts, like mortal sons of clay,  
&emsp;Shrink under fate’s constraining force,  
E’en they like dogs have but their day,  
&emsp;And traverse but a stated course.  

Hide your diminish’d heads ye ghosts,  
&emsp;If heads ye have, or else your shoulders;  
Ye ancient goblins cease your boasts,  
&emsp;Attend my tale ye sprite beholders!  

Know then in fair Queen Ann Street East  
&emsp;There dwells a man of worth and fame,  
One, whom you’d think, of all men least,  
&emsp;Intended for a ghostly game.  
 
At this man’s door, not long ago,  
&emsp;Just as the parish clock struck ten,  
The bell was heard to ring! — when lo!  
&emsp;The bell was heard to ring again!  

The door was op’d, yet none could spy,  
&emsp;Who dar’d thus stir up such alarm;  
Without, within, below, on high  
&emsp;All stood confounded by the charm.  

Yet not enough — for now a sound  
&emsp;Of long-protracted pain was heard;  
Then would the walks with blows rebound,  
&emsp;Tho’ neither shape, nor hand appear’d!  
  
Imagination’s ample pinion  
&emsp;Swift bore her from her rainbow sky;  
And with her, from their dark dominion,  
&emsp;She brought pale fear’s fantastic fry.  
  
Man, woman, child, were dumb with dread,  
&emsp;Whilst horror changed each *object’s* hue,  
’Till each slunk trembling up to bed  
&emsp;Scar’d by the lights that burnt so blue!  
  
The ghost was laid — ’twas silent all  
&emsp;Though not a soul could get a doze;  
Nor groans were heard; nor thund’ring wall,  
&emsp;Nor bell, — ’till all the folks arose.  
  
Then once again the din began,  
&emsp;Our wight was now well nigh distraught  
And swore he’d fetch a cunning man  
&emsp;Who held all ghostlike things at nought.  
  
The cunning man to Ann Street drove,  
&emsp;He search’d the wall, he search’d the wire  
He heard the noise but vainly strove  
&emsp;To make the mystery transpire.  
  
The cunning man discours’d of *”matter”*,  
&emsp;Of *”causes & effects unknown,”*  
How *”of itself”* a bell might clatter,  
&emsp;And bricks and mortar might sigh & groan.  
  
Said science yet had much to do  
&emsp;Before she laid Dame Nature bare,  
Besides he’d boldly ask who knew  
&emsp;The chemical effects of air?  
 
Small consolation for our wight! —  
&emsp;Th’ *effect* he car’d for, not the *cause*,  
So off he trudg’d to name his plight  
&emsp;To an expounder of the laws.  
  
With laws & statutes cramm’d, he came  
&emsp;The ghostly tenant to eject;  
First in our noble sov’reigns name  
&emsp;Commanded peace! — this dialect,  
  
Must have been gibb’rish to the ghost  
&emsp;For straight, a noise as thunder loud  
Rapid as light’ning clear’d the coast  
&emsp;Nor left one remnant of the crowd!  
  
Old Minos gall’d at this reception  
&emsp;So riotous, so strange, so rude —  
Gravely gave out as his conception  
&emsp;The ghost was one of Satan’s brood!  
  
Indeed, quoth he ’tis plain & level  
&emsp;Since tailors at the next door dwell,  
That this same ghost must be the devil  
&emsp;Hid in the tailors motley hell! [^2]  
  
Forthwith in solemn order sped  
&emsp;His worship to the hapless tailors,  
His valiant van by runners led;  
&emsp;His rear brought up by clarks and jailors,  
  
How poor is language, Art how vain  
&emsp;To speak the pangs that guilt produces  
Where culprits view the rattling chain,  
&emsp;Or gibbets tall, or dangling nooses.  
  
So *Snip*, whose conscience somewhat soil’d  
&emsp;In truth was rather *worse for wear*,  
In anguish from the sight recoil’d  
&emsp;When first he saw the justice there!  
  
Swift on his knees the varlet try’d  
&emsp;His worship’s pity to awaken —  
And with a mournful accent cry’d,  
&emsp;“Take all my *cabbage*, spare my bacon!”  
  
At this the inquisitor was huff’d  
&emsp;Judging it offer’d in derision,  
So straight poor tremb’ling snip was cuff’d  
&emsp;And sent to limbo for “misprision!” 
  
His little darling daughter then  
&emsp;By solemn sacred oath was bound,  
To tell unto these *legal* men  
&emsp;“If aught she knew that made the sound!”  
  
Her answer, simple thing, was plain.  
&emsp;“She nothing knew and nothing heard”  
Nor all their quirking arts could gain,  
&emsp;Another syllable or word! —  
  
But now at last this ghost is laid!  
&emsp;Without or priest, or sage confessor, —  
Thanks to the *Institution’s* aid  
&emsp;Who sent their learned *sound* Professor!  
  
He watched the rattling wonder slowly,  
&emsp;He bid the folks their terrors hush;  
Then swore by all that saints deem holy  
&emsp;The noise was made by wooden brush!  
  
And to confirm his affirmation,  
&emsp;And shame all rude incred’lous airs,  
He told them that the ghostly station  
&emsp;Lay underneath the kitchen stairs!  
  
And true as fate on bursting in  
&emsp;To where the spirit lay *perdue*  
They found the secret of the din,  
&emsp;Molly the housemaid met their view!  
  
There hid, the jade had play’d the ghost,  
&emsp;With jack-weight, Brushes, bells and stones;  
Or when the *plaintives* pleased her most  
&emsp;Assail’d their ears with sighs & groans!  
  
This closed the scene — refuse who can  
&emsp;A triffling tribute of applause  
To hear who pos’d a cunning man  
&emsp;And eke the cunning men of laws.  
  
And now a moral to the tale;  
&emsp;And then concludes our harmless labour  
*Look well at home, ere you assail*  
&emsp;*With fool-born fears* your next door neighbour!
