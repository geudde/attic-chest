In vain for me the queen of flow’rs  
Laughs amid her fragrant bow’rs,  
And graceful, near the blooming queen  
The lily’s beauteous form is seen;  
The fringed pink, the eglantine  
Are sweet, and sweet the jessamine,  
But none of these my fancy move  
For different is the flower I love.  
  
But quit awhile the gay parterre  
And all the courtly beauties there,  
To wander by yon gliding stream,  
Where lovers, and where poets dream,  
Amidst the leafy canopy  
Sits love, and sings their lullaby,  
There dearest Stella is my bow’r  
And there you’ll find my darling flow’r.  
  
The flow’ret from its lowly bed  
Scarce lifts its unassuming head  
But freely all its sweetness lends  
To her who o’er its beauty bends  
Sweet type of him whose humble name  
Is yet unknown to pow’r or fame  
Who straying once in pensive mood,  
Descried this flower, its beauty view’d  
Then pluck’d it from its native shade  
And bore it to his much lov’d maid.  
Sweet was the moment, and the hour,  
But sweeter still, this little flower.  
  
Violetta
