> Written on contemplating a Pile of splendid Ruins

“Say, *Time*, whose, once, yon stately pile, (I cried)  
Which, now, thou crumbled ruthless with the soil?”  
He answer’d not — but spread his pinions wide,  
And flew, with eager haste, to ampler spoil.  

“Say, then prolific *Fame*, whose breath supplies  
Life to bright works of wonder, what were those?”  
Abash’d with blushes only she replies,  
Like one whose bosom heaves with secret woes.  

Lost in amaze I turn’d my steps aside,  
When, o’er the pile, I saw *Oblivion* stride,  
With mien imperious, and with vacant eyne.  
“Perchance thou know’st (I cried) — Ah speak! declare!”  
Abrupt, she answer’d hoarse, and shook the air,  
“Whose *once* it was, I seek not, *now*, tis *Mine!*”
