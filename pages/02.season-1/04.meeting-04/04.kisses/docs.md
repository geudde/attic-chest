The Parent Lip in Infant Years  
With balmy soothing power  
Can win a smile thro’ glittering tears  
And dry the April shower,  
The Lover’s rapture breathing Kiss  
Its favor’d Mortals prove  
Feeds high that trembling Flame of bliss  
All fascinating Love  

Years of delight! tho’ past, no sigh  
My Bosom e’er shall heave,  
While Heav’n can give a higher joy  
’Twere impious sure to grieve:  
’Tis mine that higher Joy to prove  
It mantles in my Breast  
While on the Cherub lips I love  
The Parent Kiss is prest.
