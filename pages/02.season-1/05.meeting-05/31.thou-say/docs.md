And canst thou say thou dost not know    
The Cause that Clouds my pensive brow?    
That Steals the Roses from my Cheek,    
And bids my Tongue forbear to Speak?    
Dulls the gay lustre of my Eye    
And fills my breast with many a sigh?    
Bids o’er my heart love’s anguish Creep    
And Scares the gentle God of Sleep?    
This true, thou dost not know the Elf    
Ah no! thou dost not know thyself    
    
Valentine
