> With a drawing of a heart changing from red in consequence of being pierced by an arrow of colour

Do not refuse to read one line  
From your forsaken Valentine  
Although you leave me sans relief  
A prey to jealousy & grief  

Too well my papers edge declares  
The influence of my evil stars  
Forsaken green my thoughts enclose  
While anger in my bosom glows  

Now every movement of my soul  
Is under jealousyâ€™s control  
And here behold my hapless heart  
Is turning yellow with his dart  

Nor wonder oh too cruel youth  
That I in hopeless anguish pine  
For while unshaken is my truth  
Another is thy Valentine
