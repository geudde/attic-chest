All powerful Love is like the Sword of Old  
By Acban given to Cambuscan bold  
No armour could its piercing stroke endure  
Nought but itself its own dire wound could cure  
And no less mighty Loves keen pointed darts  
Pierce with resistless force the hardest hearts  
Against their power no prudence e’er can guard  
And no defence the threat’ning danger ward  
The wounds of those who are doomed his rage to feel  
None but himself, who gave those wounds can heal  
Then let dear youth, my prayers your soul incline  
To heal the wounds you’ve given your Valentine.
