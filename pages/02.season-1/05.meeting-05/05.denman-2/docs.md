At Midnight’s solemn hour I chose  
Your promised Verses to compose  
So kneeling near the Attic Chest  
I thus the sacred Nine addrest  

Daughters of Memory, attend,  
And me your suppliant befriend,  
If in early years I paid,  
Homage to each tuneful maid,  
If my rude and Childish Lays  
Then were honoured with your praise  
If, as years increase, to you  
Still I bend with reverence due;  
Whether in Arcadian Bowers,  
Now you braid your locks with flowers  
Or in Academic shades  
Or in Tempe’s lucid glades  
Now you sing of Beauty’s charms  
Love’s delights, and feats of arms  

Or — but why my call prolong?  
Arise, inspiring power of song,  
Erato rise, they Lyric strains  
Impart — nor think my soul disdains,  
Calliope they nobler line  
No! sweet Empress of the Nine!  
I in some maturer time,  
May bid thee raise the Epic Rhymes;  
But they Sister’s lighter treasures  
Now diffused in sprightly measures,  
Best will suit my humbler strain,  
But alas! I sue in vain,  
Not a Muse my call attends  
Not a Muse my verse befriends,  
Sure slumber — Have I chose,  
A moment sacred to repose?  

No we sleep not — Powers divine,  
Answering cried the wakeful Nine,  
Never feel soft slumbers power,  
Superior to his force they tower.  
But so many on this day  
Have required Erato’s Lay,  
And certain Maids near Fitzroy Square  
Have been from Morn till Night her care.  
She has not left a single line  
To grace thy hapless Valentine.  

&emsp;Silent and sorrowing I withdrew  
To find the Muse engrossed by you  
&emsp;&emsp;When you had made such large demands  
Upon my weary head and hands,  
Defrauded of the Muses aid  
&emsp;To you I leave the rhyming Trade  
&emsp;I send you slips of paper three  
&emsp;Which you may fill to self from me  
&emsp;And should not this exhaust your Store  
&emsp;Of ill-got Verse — I’ll send you more.
