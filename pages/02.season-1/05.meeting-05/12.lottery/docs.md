At Cupid’s Altar see this trembling Swain  
To the lov’d Nymph with sighs declare his pain  
And with a ticket hope her breast to move  
With him to try the Lottery of Love  
Nor she his ably pleaded suit rejects  
But from his hand the ticket half accepts  
Doubtfull if yet the doubtful chance to try  
While hope and fear stand trembling in her eye  
At length his promises o’ercome her fears  
And just consenting the fond maid appears  
So may my prayers your flinty heart incline  
To take me for your constant Valentine
