It is my ardent wish to twine  
A wreath for you my Valentine  
But neither Rose nor Eglantine  
Nor Pink, nor starlike Jassamine  
Nor lily fair, nor gay Woodbine  
Nor Amaryllis can be found  
In all the Gardens ample round  
To grace the day of Valentine.  

By Winter chased, those lovely flowers  
Now only bloom in Southern Bowers  
Blest by the Sun’s perfecting beams  
Who on our Isle but faintly gleams  
Their charms with rival lustre shine  
To grace the day of Valentine  
Through Orange and through Citron Groves  
There the happy lover roves  
Whose unnumbered flowerets bloom  
Shedding around a rich perfume  
While fruit Hesperian from above  
He culls a present for his love  
And with ardent haste does twine  
A Garland for his Valentine  
Tho’ you never may behold  
On their stems those fruits of Gold  
Yet in Albions Vessels borne  
They your table shall adorn  
Tho’ of such flowers it is not mine  
Wreaths ambrosial to entwine  
Beauteous in our clime are seen  
Many a valued *Evergreen*  
Sacred to the Queen of Love  
Here the Myrtle decks the Grove  
And the Glossy *Laurel* here  
Scorns the tyrant of the Year  
Of these my Garland I’ll compose  
Nor mourn the absence of the rose  
*Honour*, *Love*, and *constancy*  
Thus shall form a wreath for thee  
To which the *snow drop pure* I’ll join  
*Fair Emblem* of my *Valentine*
