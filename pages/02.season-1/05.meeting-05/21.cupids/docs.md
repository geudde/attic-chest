#### A Cantata for Three Voices

![](cupid.jpg?resize=400)
  
&emsp;_Air, ‘Shepherds I have lost my love’_.  
  
Ladies, I have lost a Quill!  
Have you seen my Pinion?  
’Twas stolen by a little Jill,  
O! she’s a wicked Minion.  
I for her, my nest forsook  
All in a frosty morning  
With chilblain fingers, icy look  
She tore my rich adorning.  
  
&emsp;_Air, ‘Hey my Kitten my Kitten,’_  
  
O! my Quill, my Quill  
And o my Quill so deary  
Such a fine Quill as mine  
Was never seen far no neary  
How can I fly up, up, up,  
How can I fly downy, downy,  
How can I fly backwards and forwards,  
How can I fly roundy, roundy?  
  
&emsp;_Air, ‘Ponder well ye Parents dear’_  
  
’Twas saucy Nell, who stole my Quill  
Which makes my wing to droop  
Of Vengeance I will have my fill  
And shut her in a coop.  
  
Then ponder well, ye Virgins dear,  
I can’t attend your call,  
Cato only, now must be your cheer  
Old Maids, ye must die all!  
  
Cupidon  
  
_To finish with a chorus of ‘Oh, my Quill, my Quill’ _
