Aid me all ye Powers divine  
While I sing my Valentine  
Favourite of the tuneful nine  
Is my sprightly Valentine  
Sparkling are her hazel eyne  
And the chin and forehead shine  
Of my lovely Valentine  
Lips that glow like ruby fine  
Or the scarlett coralline  
Cheeks that never knew carmine  
Blushing like the nectarine  
Grace my blooming Valentine  
Not so sweet is eglantine  
Nor the fragrant wild Woodbine  
Vi’let Rose nor Jessamine  
As my sweet, sweet Valentine  
If thy heart to mirth incline  
Wit with humour arch combine  
In my playful Valentine  
And of higher themes are thine  
Solid sense and judgment join  
In my serious Valentine  
  
Oh delightful treat to dine  
With my mirthful Valentine  
Fretful as the porcupine  
I behold the rosy wine  
Turkey fat or savoury chine  
Or of beef the Knightly loin  
If without my Valentine  
When I catch with net or line  
Gudgeon, perch or fish marine  
I the scaly prize assign  
To my lovely Valentine  
Yet no fish in sea Tyrrhine  
Or the Danube, Meuse or Rhine  
Silver Thames or coaly Tyne  
Scottish Tweed or Irish Boyne  
With the book in bone narine  
Felt my torments, I opine,  
Gudgeon to my Valentine.  
When among my Fathers swine  
Bleating sheep or lowring kine  
In some pasture I recline  
With my buxom Valentine  
While I in her looks entwine  
Rose and pink and celandine  
Oft I would a kiss purloin,  
From my charming Valentine.  
But with anger infantine,  
Sweetly pouting (not feline).  
  
She will check the bold design  
Absent from my Valentine,  
On a Haycock laid supine,  
Oft I at my fate repine,  
Weeping tears of scalding brine,  
Then had I a Princes coin  
I would give it to rejoin  
Her I love — my Valentine.  
I shall gladly life resign  
From a post or lofty pine  
Dangling like an alehouse sign  
If my scornful Valentine  
Shall my humble love decline  
But what transport will be mine  
If the stars in square or trine,  
From th’ethereal chrystalline  
Tell that heavens decrees design  
Me the Elm and she the Vine  
Bending then at beauty’s shrine  
I till health and life decline  
Will fondly love my Valentine.
