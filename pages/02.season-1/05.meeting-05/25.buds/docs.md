&emsp;See how the blooming Buds  
&emsp;Surroun’d the Parent Flow’r  
&emsp;While o’er their youthful heads  
&emsp;Is the paternal Bow’r,  
The full blown Flow’r with Matron grace  
Views all, with looks of love  
May no rude gale approach the place  
Or ruder hand the stem deface  
But Peace reign through the Grove  

Zephyrus
