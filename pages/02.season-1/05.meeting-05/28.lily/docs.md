The lofty lily rears its snowy head  
And scorns the lowly flowers that grace the bed  
With potent sweets it scents the passing gale  
Nor deigns to heed the lily of the vale  
Yet in thy bosom it may chance to bloom  
Display its charms and shed its rich perfume  
There; delicate and fair in form and hue  
And humbly elegant resemble you  

Constantio
