Hail matchless Architect whose tuneful tongue,  
Can fascinate as erst the syren’s song,  
Whose hand address and eloquence refin’d;  
Achieve each purpose of thy pregnant mind;  
Now grave, thy subject wisdom’s self sustains,  
Now chasten’d wit, thy brilliant fancy reins,  
Nor less if versatile thou sweep the lyre,  
Their favor’d poet all the Muses fire,  
Thine too, the silent qualities that please,  
The smile complacent & the courtly ease.  
The dignity that awes, but not alarms;  
And friendship’s glow that adds a thousand charms:  
’Tis thus that P-d-n every heart enchains,  
’Tis thus his magic influence he retains,  
Vain were thy herb Cyllenius to repell,  
Charms such as these — or counteract his spell.
