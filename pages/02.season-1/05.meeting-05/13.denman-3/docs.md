When Cupid last by Venus sent  
Around the Earth a sportsman went  
To London Town the archer came  
A cover always stocked with game  
Against the best the noblest hearts  
He still addrest his venomed darts.  
Or poacher like his viewless snares  
He spread to catch them unawares  
From end to end from side to side  
He spread destruction far and wide  
And turned at length his roving feet  
Sweet maid to Buckinghamo Street  
In at thy open window flew  
And in a corner lay perdue  
In sportive mood to dress you came  
And made the urchins bricks your game  
The string which ready strained he held  
Incensed the god let go impelled  
By his immortal hand the dart  
Hissed on, and sought they heedless heart  
But Phoebus, with protecting power  
Preserved thee in that fateful hour  
Deprived the arrow of its force  
And turned it from its destined course  
The baffled archer sees with pain  
His skill by higher powers made vain  
And quits his quiver, bow, and darts  
For secret snares and fraudful arts  
The spreads his toils where you must pass  
To his confederate — your glass  
The heavenly habitants on high  
Your danger view; and from the sky  
Swift Dian hastens to thy aid  
And with her came the blue-eyed maid  
The wily urchin sees again  
His craft by higher powers made vain  
Vexed from you chamber he withdrew  
And weeping straight to Paphos flew  
No more I wonder that my love  
Should fail your frozen breast to move  
Since Cupid both by force and art  
Has vainly tried to catch your heart  
Yet still by hope inspired I try  
This morn to catch your favouring eye  
For oft ’tis said coy maids incline  
To pity on St Valentine.  

Pambo now tired of eating tarts  
Steals for his food the ladies’ hearts  
(One in his mouth he now is stuffing  
And eating as you’d eat a muffin)  
Unhappy me, he’s stolen mine  
And will not be my Valentine.  

See here of hearts the empress stand  
Her ruby sceptre of command  
High holding in her lily hand  
O’er all with uncontested sway  
She reigns and makes e’en Pam obey  
For Cupid shot at him a dart  
And pierced the rogues unguarded heart  
Not has he need to fret & pine  
She is to day his Valentine.
