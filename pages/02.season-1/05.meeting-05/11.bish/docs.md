When Bish or Carter Puffs advance  
To make you buy a Lottery chance  
Adorn’d with every tempting grace  
The prizes in the front they place  
Contriving that the dazzled eye  
Shall not the numerous blanks descry  
So in the Lottery of Love  
When beauty or when talents move  
Some swain the marriage state to prove  
The amorous God with studious care  
Displays the prizes of the fair  
Contriving that the numerous crew  
Of blanks shall still elude your view  
But when the marriage knot is tied  
No more those blanks he seeks to hide  
Each day some fault unseen before  
Starts up and seems to threaten more  
Thrice happy those the favour’d few  
Who draw Dear Ann a prize like you  
While every day in lessening Row  
The blanks their front diminished show  
While every day some unseen prize  
With opening beauties meets their eyes  
And blest is he oh Nymph divine  
Who drew you for my Valentine
