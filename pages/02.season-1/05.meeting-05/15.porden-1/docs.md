On Ezla’s pleasant banks reclined,  
&emsp;Two happy lovers talked apart;  
The myrtle with the rose they twined,  
&emsp;And vows renewed flowed from each heart.  
  
To arms stern honour called the youth  
&emsp;His country’s freedom to maintain,  
Ah! much he doubted then her truth,  
&emsp;For jealousy’s the lover’s bane.  
  
Dejected when he viewed the strand,  
&emsp;She marked his mien, his altered eye,  
Then wrote these words upon the sand  
&emsp;“Death for thy Ellen not inconstancy.”  
  
All in an orange grove unseen  
&emsp;Sly Cupid laughing took his stand  
On woman’s faith to see him lean  
&emsp;Or trust to vows inscribed in sand.  
	  
Fair Ezla’s Banks describe right well  
&emsp;The offerings to Saint Valentine  
For all his hopes ere curfew bell  
&emsp;Each flattered lover must resign.  
  
Yet for the mole that gilds thy cheek  
&emsp;I’ll give the wealth of Samarcand  
Or on love’s pinions boldly seek  
&emsp;The gems of India’s glowing land.  
  
To Lethe’s flood all fears I will confine  
If thou wilt deign to be my Valentine.  
  
I.
