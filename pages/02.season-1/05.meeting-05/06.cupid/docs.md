Cupid spitted on a dart  
At his altar roasts my heart  
It burns with ardent love for thee  
It weeps at thy inconstancy  
But through the tears it sheds would make  
A fishpond swell into a lake  
So great the heat it still is wasting  
And all those tears but serve for basting  

Take pity on it ere the flame  
Has to a cinder dried its frame  
If from they eyes one drop but flow  
T’will cruel maid relieve my woe  
One tear of thine can soon assuage  
This dreadful fires’ consuming rage  
Then let thy pity match thy form divine  
And rescue thy half-roasted Valentine.
