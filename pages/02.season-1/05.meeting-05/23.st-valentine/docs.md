St Valentine was an eloquent and learned Egyptian, who professed Plato’s philosophy. He lived in the third century, and quitted his faith because an other was preferred before him to a bishoprick. He made use of dreams of certain gods; observing the birds to chase their mates about the fourteenth of February, he recommended it as a proper time for young men and maids to chuse their love’s: from whence it became a custom, first in Italy, and afterwards in other places, to send compliments to one another on that day. He was a man of most admirable parts, and so famous for his love and friendship, that the custom of chusing Valentines upon his festival took its rise from thence.
