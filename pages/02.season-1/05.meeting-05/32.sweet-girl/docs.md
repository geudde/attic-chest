Awake sweet Girl awake    
See the bright morning break    
Busy footsteps hurrying by    
Tell that now the Sun is high    
Borne on wings of purest white    
Morning spreads its fullest light    
Sore thou fearst and sore I fear    
Prying strangers roaming near    
May divulge the rumour free    
How thee I love, how thou lovest me    
Old Time strides boldly on towards Nine    
And yet thou thinkâ€™st not on thy Valentine    
Awake sweet Girl awake    
    
Lucifer    
    
Son of the Morning
