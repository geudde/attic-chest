> Written a figure of Atlas with Hearts

Thus low beneath my load I bend  
&emsp;&emsp;To rest but dare not tarry  
Me sportive Love and Venus send  
&emsp;&emsp;Their Valentines to carry.  
	
Then haste my weary back relieve  
&emsp;&emsp;For many a heart is thine  
And you will on this day receive  
&emsp;&emsp;Full many a Valentine.

Then bid my lawful hire be paid  
&emsp;&emsp;Unheard no Swain should bleed  
A heart not twopence worth, sweet maid  
&emsp;&emsp;Is very bad indeed.
