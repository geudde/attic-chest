Master Cupid this morning arose in a hurry  
“My dear Mama Venus, only see what a flurry,  
Sure my Vot’ries are more than ever elated  
All around me with amorous dispatches are freighted.  
I think” says the arch fellow “in my later flights  
I’ve observed some sly corners where e’en learned Wights  
Have been busy as bees when collecting their honey  
Making out a long train of scrawls serious and funny,  
That throughout my vast Empire on this day of mine  
To my Subjects are known by the term *Valentine*  
One Place above others, where *I* once bore some sway  
But the Muses now boast, that they carry the day,  
And that they even took flight from Parnassus  
To visit the sprightliest sweetest of Lasses  
And so managed to give friend Apollo the slip  
That to find them Mercurius was sent on a trip  
And so fagg’d poor old Peg, that he look’d like a rip  
I also suspect some other favorites of mine  
Who long have been fondly attached to the nine  
Have engaged in the task of attacking poor hearts  
By fine Drawings of me, of my quivers and darts,  
By sonnets and madrigals, and words breathing fire  
Such only as I am won’t to inspire  
Zooks! what fun ’twould be to entrap Nymphs so noted  
Who to ’Poll and the Muses are so much devoted,  
For I owe those nine Girls some very old spites  
They’ve long been notorious for thwarting my rights  
And though I may thank them for ennobling my chain  
They too oft interfere with my absolute reign —”  
Then standing on tiptoe, and spreading his wings  
Seiz’d a quiver of darts, dipp’d in Helicon’s springs,  
And with look the most arch, cried “a bold heart never loses  
I’ll muster among these same Lasses the Muses,  
Who I hear hid themselves in a Chest known to Fame  
That from Attica’s classical Realms lately came  
I’ll there lie in ambush” — “My dear Boy,” cried his Mother,  
“The thought me delights, far beyond any other,  
I too would go with you, but know by some forms  
With the Muses I’m not upon visiting terms  
They’ve passed some reflections that I choose not to brook  
And we certainly therefore, cannot meet in a nook.  
You shall not fail however, to see my best graces  
Very fully dispensed in the forms and the faces  
Of the Fair that assemble on each certain night  
To the Muses devoted, and the Genii that write  
For this Attic Emporium of Whim, Learning, and Genius  
So priz’d by the witty, grave, gay, and ingenious.”  
  
Look then well to your hearts, ye fair Damsels who meet  
Round this Shrine of the Muses, for though you may greet  
The approach of his Godship, and defying his darts  
Think they’ll blunted fall, when directed at hearts  
Protected by your’s by the aegis of Learning  
Yet remember the Urchin is sly and discerning,  
And when his sharpest darts he distributes around  
Like a Tyrant he reigns, if as a Victor he wound.
