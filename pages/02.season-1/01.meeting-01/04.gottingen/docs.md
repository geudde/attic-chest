Ah me, and are ye going to,  
&emsp;The wars for to be shotten in;  
Soon will ye mourn, alas ye Stu—  
—dents of hapless, of the far-famed U—  
&emsp;—Niversity of Gottingen 

Soon will ye hate that much-loved Bu—  
&emsp;—onaparte, now so hot-in-grain;  
Ye never thought he’d conscribe you,  
But more would reverence the U—  
&emsp;—Niversity of Gottingen. 

How did ye look around, how view,  
&emsp;The Books ye had been blotting in,  
When first the dreadful news ye knew,   
That bade ye bid a last adieu,  
&emsp;To them and eke to Gottingen.  

<span data-tippy="All soldiers non to Spain" class="green">Though new the Spanish plains</span> ye Stu—  
&emsp;—dents bold, <span data-tippy="in troops are" class="green">you are proudly</span> trotting in,  
<span data-tippy="And" class="green">You</span> soon may find good cause to rue  
The moment when ye left the U—  
&emsp;—Niversity of Gottingen. 

Unused to hardship ye will rue,  
&emsp;The mischiefs ye are plotting in,  
Anxious will sit, and sadly view,  
With Fancy’s eye the distant U—  
&emsp;—Niversity of Gottingen.  

When ye are dead I wonder who,  
&emsp;Will tell the Graves ye’re rotting in,  
Or even say here lie a few,  
“Who studied morals, at the U—”  
&emsp;—Niversity of Gottingen.  

“Oxford and Cambridge, sisters two,  
&emsp;With prejudice begotten in,”  
Proud will look round, and sneering view,  
You and your poor forsaken U—  
&emsp;—Niversity of Gottingen.
