Hard by a stream where waters stray  
Through many a channel, Love repos’d  
Upon a bed of reeds he lay,  
And soon in sleep his eyelids clos’d. 

To view his beauties as he slept,  
The naiads of the silver stream  
With silent step around his crept  
Nor rous’d the slumb’rer from his dream.  

Till one at length incautious spoke  
To praise the beauty of the boy,  
Love at last the grateful sound awoke  
But in his breast conceal’d his joy.

And still in soft engaging smiles  
The artful Urchin hid his wiles  
Till the rash nymphs no longer coy  
Plac’d on their knees the lovely boy.  

His brows with flowing bands they bound  
His hair with many a flowing braid,  
And love still gracious look’d around,  
And with sweet smiles their cares repaid.  

But soon within each throbbing breast  
They felt his subtle poisons glide  
Each heart his treach’rous confest  
And thus these rash immortals cried.  

“Oh! Love, restore the soft repose  
“We late possess’d till here you came  
“Not our own streams can cool the flame  
“That in each tortur’d bosom glows!”  

“Cherish the warmth that I inspire”  
Says Love, “nor thus my conduct blame,  
“I, when I please, excite the fire  
“But cannot quench the rising flames!”
