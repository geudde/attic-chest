&emsp;Deep in the lonesome dungeon’s gloom  
The captive oft forgets his pains,  
And dances to the sound of chains  
With hope of liberty to come.  

&emsp;Gaily observe the sea boy sport  
Upon the giddy topmast high  
He mocks the willows and the sky  
To reach at last his dear-lov’d port.  

&emsp;Tho’ fierce, the lion spurns the soil  
And red with fire his eyeballs glow  
The hunter braves his angry foe  
To win the glorious trophied spoil.  

&emsp;And yonder sordid wretch behold  
Who toiling in the noxious mine  
Scorns not in misery to pine  
Urg’d by th’ insatiate thirst for gold.  

&emsp;Thro’ fields of death the warrior flies  
And rushes on with mad career  
Stranger to pity and to fear  
To gain the victor’s envied prize.  

&emsp;Whilst I unkind Maria’s slave  
A hopeless fate am doom’d to prove  
Shunn’d by the cruel maid I love —  
My lot despair, my rest the grave.
