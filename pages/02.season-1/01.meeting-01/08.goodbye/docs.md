One day, good bye met how d’ye do  
Too close to shun saluting,  
But soon the rival sisters flew  
From kissing to disputing.  
  
Away, says how d’ye do, your mien  
Appals my chearful nature,  
No name so sad as your’s is seen  
In sorrow’s nomenclature.  
  
Whene’r I give one sunshine hour  
Your cloud comes o’er to shade it,  
Whene’r I plant one bosom flower  
Your mildew drop so fade it.  
  
Ere how d’ye do has tun’d each tongue  
In hope’s delightful measure;  
Good bye in friendship’s ear has rung  
The knell of parting pleasure.  
  
From sorrows past my mimic skill  
Draws smiles of consolation;  
While you from present joys distil  
The tears of separation.  
  
Good bye replied, your statement’s true  
And well your cause you’ve pleaded  
But pray who’d think of how d’ye do  
Unless good bye preceded?  
  
How oft as at the court of love  
Concealment is the fashion  
When how d’ye do has fail’d to move  
Good bye reveals the passion.  
  
How oft when Cupid’s fires decline  
As every heart remembers  
One sigh of mine & and only mine  
Revives the dying embers.  
  
Go, bid the timid lover choose  
And I’ll resign my charter  
If he for ten kind how d’ye does  
One kind good bye would barter.  
  
From love & friendship’s kindred source  
We both derive existence  
And they wou’d both lose half their force  
Without our joint assistance.  
  
’Tis well the world our merit knows,  
Since time, there’s no denying,  
One half in how d’ye doing goes,  
And t’other in good by’ing.  
  
Without my prior influence  
Cou’d your’s have ever flourish’d  
And can your hand one flower dispense  
But those my fears have nourished?
