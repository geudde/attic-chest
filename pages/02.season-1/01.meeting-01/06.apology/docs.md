My drowsy Muse an idle Jade!  
&emsp;Has grieved and Sadly (sorely) vex’d me,  
She sure forgets her rhyming Trade  
&emsp;Or else for spite perplex’d me;   
For well she knew for spritely Nell  
&emsp;I wou’d have penn’d a Sonnet,  
But envious as a mortal belle  
&emsp;She is, depend upon it.  
 
For though I call’d her up at seven  
&emsp;Madam ne’er rose till past eleven  
And then in such a pouting mood  
I found she do my verse no good  
&emsp;Vexatious that each flowret fair  
I wish’d for Nelly to entwine  
&emsp;Should thus have vanish’d into air  
And cheated my sweet Valentine.
