Nymphydia (pretty Gossip) told  
To Michael Drayton, once a story  
Which happen’d to Queen Mab of old  
And one Sir Knight Pig-wiggin bold!  
Whom Oberon did bravely scold  
For tarnishing his Lady’s glory.  
  
This fairy Maid of Honour still  
Tho’ banish’d for her love of prating  
Delights the moonlight hours to kill  
Beside a gently murm’ring rill  
Some favor’d mortals ear to fill  
With anecdotes well worth relating  
  
Now I, a poor love stricken wight  
Had wander’d forth, on Cupid railing  
’Twas sooth to say, a moonlight night  
When I did meet this Lady bright  
Who as I said took much delight  
In other Ladies faults detailing.  
  
An humbler theme, for me she chose  
Than Fairy Queens and Martial tilting  
’Twas the flirtation of the Rose  
Her Coquetry she would expose  
And how she treated both her Beaux  
In short she call’d it downright jilting.  
  
’Twas summer, fair Nymphydia cried,  
“The flowers all around were blowing  
But one above the rest in pride  
Soft blushing like a youthful Bride  
Near whom fond Zephyrs frequent sigh’d  
The Rose in all her beauty glowing”  
  
“Near the vain flow’r upon a spray  
The tuneful Nightingale complaining  
Soft warbled his harmonious lay  
To her who turn’d another way.  
No kind attention seem’d to pay  
His plaintive Melody disdaining.”  
  
“But mark, what made her seem so shy  
For me ’twas easy to discover  
The cause of her averted eye  
Zephyr might chance be passing by  
And as he’s prone to jealousy  
She’d not offend her fav’rite Lover.”  
  
And do you know! the forward thing!  
Proud of her fragrance & her beauty  
Requires that one, all night should sing  
At noon, the *other swain* may bring  
Refreshing gales on silken wing  
And thus she keeps them *both* on duty.
