If Buonaparte had of Spain all provinces but one,  
You ask why would this emperor be like a naked man?  
Why if the one be one I know, tho’ much he’d have to brag on  
And might by flattering bards be call’d the new Hesperian dragon;  
For with such wealth, such fame, and power he would not have a-rag-on.

Don Ferdinando Fudge
