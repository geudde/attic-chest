#### Written in a Young Lady’s Album, who had spoiled a fine complexion by frequenting late Assemblies, Concerts, etc.

&emsp;See where expos’d to chilling dews
Yon night-expanding flow’r[^1] displays
&emsp;Her jaundic’d form, no blooming hues
She wears, & with the morn decays.

&emsp;While all the brighter flow’rs of spring
Their glories veiled to rest retir’d
&emsp;Wak’d by the Bee or Zephyr’s wing
With fresher dyes will rise admir’d

&emsp;Learn hence ye fair who beauty prize
The gloomy night’s wan influence shun
&emsp;Like Flora’s brightest fav’rites rise
And draw new splendor from the Sun

Timanthes
