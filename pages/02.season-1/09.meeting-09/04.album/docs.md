<span class="title">Written in a Young Lady’s album, who had spoiled a fine complexion by frequenting late assemblies, concerts, etc.</span>

&emsp;See where expos’d to chilling dews  
Yon night-expanding flow’r[^1] displays  
&emsp;Her jaundic’d form, no blooming hues  
She wears, & with the morn decays.

&emsp;While all the brighter flow’rs of spring  
Their glories veiled to rest retir’d  
&emsp;Wak’d by the bee or zephyr’s wing  
With fresher dyes will rise admir’d

&emsp;Learn hence ye fair who beauty prize  
The gloomy night’s wan influence shun  
&emsp;Like Flora’s brightest fav’rites rise  
And draw new splendor from the sun

Timanthes
