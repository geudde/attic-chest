Young Love with rosy fetters bound  
&emsp;The Muses give to Beautyâ€™s care.  
Fair Venus sunk in grief profound,  
&emsp;Now seeks her darling far and near.  
And costly gifts the Goddess bears  
&emsp;For him who shall the child restore  
Ah! vain are riches, vain are tears,  
&emsp;For Love well pleased his <span data-tippy="livery" class="green">fetters</span> wears  
And will from Beauty part no more.
