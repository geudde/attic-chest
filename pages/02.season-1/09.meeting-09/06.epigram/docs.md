<span class="title">An Epigram upon Dr. Toe of Cambridge, who courted a lady who afterwards married her footman</span>

Twixt Doctor Toe & footman Joe,  
A rivalship befell,  
Which of the twain should be the swain  
And bear away the belle.

The footman gain’d the lady’s heart,  
And who can blame her — no man:  
The whole prevail’d against its part  
Twas footman *versus* toe-man.
