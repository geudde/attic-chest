#### An Epigram upon Dr. Toe of Cambridge, who courted a Lady who afterwards married her Footman.

Twixt Doctor Toe & footman Joe,  
A Rivalship befell,  
Which of the twain should be the Swain  
And bear away the Belle.

The footman gain’d the Lady’s heart,  
And who can blame her — no man:  
The whole prevail’d against its part  
Twas footman *versus* toe-man.
