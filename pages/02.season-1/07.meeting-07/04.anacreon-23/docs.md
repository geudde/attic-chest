If Plutus with his riches can  
Prolong the life of sordid man,  
I will amass a store of gold.  
When grown in heaping money old  
And death shall bid me haste away  
To Pluto’s realms ne’er known to day.  
To him a sum of fold I’ll give  
That I a longer term may live  
But if frail mortals cannot buy  
A transient life with gold — why sigh  
In vain my days away — nor taste  
Those pleasures which are gone in haste  
Why should I weep, when death is sure,  
Why seek not I, for care a cure  
Give me ye Gods, ’tis all I ask,  
A friend, a female, and a flask.  
With these I’ll chace dull care away  
And mirth shall ever round me play.
