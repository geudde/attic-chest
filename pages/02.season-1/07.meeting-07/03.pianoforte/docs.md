Dear Instrument, what gentle joy  
&emsp;Dost thou impart to me;  
I ne’er can want for sweet employ  
&emsp;While I am blest with thee.  
Thy charming power my cares control  
And fill with varying bliss my soul.  
  
When I am in my humours gay  
&emsp;Thy notes are brisk and boon,  
And when to sorrow I give way,  
&emsp;Thou play’st a soothing tune,  
But if to sacred thought I’m given,  
Thy sounds can waft my soul to heaven.  
  
Let no false joys which folly brings  
&emsp;To ill my heart allure,  
But like the sweet tones of thy strings,  
&emsp;Be all my pleasures pure.  
May all my life resemble thee,  
And still be full of harmony.
