The shape alone let others prize,  
Or jealous of the fair  
I look for spirit in her eyes,  
And meaning in her air.  

A damask cheek, a snowy arm  
Shall ne’er my wishes win,  
Give me the animated form  
That speaks the mind within.  

A face when awful honour shines,  
Where sense and sweetness move,  
And Angel innocence refines  
The tenderness of love.  

These are the soul of Beauty’s frame,  
Without whose vital aid  
Unfinish’d all her features seem,  
And all her roses fade.
