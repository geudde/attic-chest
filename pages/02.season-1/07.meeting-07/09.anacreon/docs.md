Beneath the Rose’s fragrant Shade  
A lurking Bee in ambush laid  
Unknown, unseen, poor Cupid stung,  
He stamped, he raved, his hand he wrung:  
Then swiftly ran and flew away  
To where fair Cytherea lay.  
The Ichor on his Finger stood,  
While thus acclaimed the angry God:  
I die, I perish, Mother dear  
Assuage, assuage the Pain I bear  
A Serpent of the winged sort  
Minute in form with Venom fraught,  
Has made this ghastly wound, behold!  
It’s name I know not tho’ I’m told  
The Monster Men Melissa call  
And can a Creature then so small?  
Said the bright Goddess smilingly,  
And can the Sting of a poor Bee?  
Give thee such Sorrow and such Pain.  
Reflect my Child, think o’er again  
The Wounds of those that feel thy Darts,  
Think’st thou that they no Pain impart?
