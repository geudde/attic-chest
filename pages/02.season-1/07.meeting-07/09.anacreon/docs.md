Beneath the rose’s fragrant shade  
A lurking bee in ambush laid  
Unknown, unseen, poor Cupid stung,  
He stamped, he raved, his hand he wrung:  
Then swiftly ran and flew away  
To where fair Cytherea lay.  
The ichor on his finger stood,  
While thus acclaimed the angry god:  
I die, I perish, mother dear  
Assuage, assuage the pain I bear  
A serpent of the winged sort  
Minute in form with venom fraught,  
Has made this ghastly wound, behold!  
It’s name I know not tho’ I’m told  
The monster men Melissa call  
And can a creature then so small?  
Said the bright goddess smilingly,  
And can the sting of a poor bee?  
Give thee such sorrow and such pain.  
Reflect my child, think o’er again  
The wounds of those that feel thy darts,  
Think’st thou that they no pain impart?
