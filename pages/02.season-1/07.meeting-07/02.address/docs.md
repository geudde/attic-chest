<div class="author">Mr Parkinson</div>

> An authors address to his first work,  
on its going to be printed.  
  
Oh spring like Pallas, daughter of the brain,  
First darling product of my spousal Muse,  
List to a parent’s love-incited strain,  
And in thy breast the dictates deep infuse!  
  
When to the bridegroom *press* your fairly wed,  
Thy virgin beauties duly laid in *sheets*  
May num’rous offspring grace thy bridal bed,  
And spread thy fame thro’ learning’s lov’d retreats.  
  
But chief tho’ that fair *Row*[^1], where loads of lore,  
Of sense and nonsense, cram the bending shelf;  
Where folly’s fictions, and the sage’s store,  
By turns are barter’d for substantial pelf.  
  
And guard lest critic Cerberus upbraid  
Growling for want of customary slice;  
Swift give the cur, the tribute of his trade,  
Since praise is bought and critics have their price.  

And know, *slow sale*, (oh deep vexation) waits  
The author, lash’d by rude reviewers’ stripes,  
His works, immortal gods, shall fill up grates  
Or line portmanteaus, or illumine pipes!  
  
Pompous *Morocco*, economic *sheep*,  
Nor royal *Russia* cloath his bantling’s back;  
Dread this my child — ascend Parnassus’ steep,  
A parent’s hopes attend thee on thy track! —
