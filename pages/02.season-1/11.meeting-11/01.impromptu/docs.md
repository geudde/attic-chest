#### Impromptu on board of a Margate Packet

<h2>A Lady with Extremely Large Breasts</h2>

Breath softly, gentle Zephyr,  
And hush’d be ev’ry breeze!  
Be still, ye waves beneath her  
For Delia’s — going to Sneeze!  

E.B.

#### The Apotheosis

Nine Virgins tried to split a Horse  
Where rump and Crapper ceases  
The weapon slipt with might force  
And broke their wit in pieces  

They vow’d they’d place him ‘mongst the Stars  
And make a wondrous glitter  
But there no more of the Horse is seen  
Than you see of an apple fritter!

1809
