#### Impromptu on board of a Margate Packet

Breath softly, gentle zephyr,  
And hush’d be ev’ry breeze!  
Be still, ye waves beneath her  
For Delia’s — going to sneeze!  

E.B.

#### The Apotheosis

Nine virgins tried to split a horse  
Where rump and crapper ceases  
The weapon slipt with might force  
And broke their wit in pieces  

They vow’d they’d place him ’mongst the stars  
And make a wondrous glitter  
But there no more of the horse is seen  
Than you see of an apple fritter!
