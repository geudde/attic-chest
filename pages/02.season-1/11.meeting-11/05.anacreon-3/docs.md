Egyptian Cadmus famed of old  
Atrides and Achilles bold  
I sing, for martial themes on fire,  
And sweep my fingers o’er the lyre,  
But ah the cords rebellious prove  
And murmur only tones of love.  
  
Another day I seize the shell  
And break the cords that dared rebel  
Anew the vocal frame I string  
And great Alcide’s toils I sing  
Again the Cords rebellious prove,  
And murmur only tones of love.  
  
Farewell for ever, Chiefs and Kings  
And Deeds befitting bolder strings  
My Lyre these fruitless efforts prove,  
Will only answer lays of Love.
