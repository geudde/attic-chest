The Attic Chest contributions exhibit inconsistency of spelling, capitalization, and punctuation, often in combination. Any attempt to reproduce these inconsistencies would make the transcriptions confusing at best, unreadable at worst. 


**Spelling:** Wherever practical, variant spellings have been replaced with modern equivalents, even where authors have shown a preference for spellings that match rhyme, e.g., ‘soul’ and ‘controul’ or ‘loud’ and ‘croud’. Spelling now considered American (e.g. ‘humor’, ‘favor’) has been preserved. 


**Capitalization:** Most Attic Chest contributors use capitalization for visual effect. The same word can be found capitalized in one line and not in another. Adjectives are often capitalized whilst the nouns they modify are not. Where consistent capitalization is used for emphasis, this has been retained. Otherwise, capitalization has been modified to reflect modern usage. 


**Punctuation:** Logical punctuation was of minor concern to most Attic Chest contributors, as evinced by the proliferation of redundant commas and dashes. Quotation marks are sometimes used to indicate direct speech, but in a manner unfamiliar to a modern reader. Marks are often opened and not closed, and interjections such as ‘he said’ or ‘she cried’ are not separated from the speech. An attempt has been made to standardize such punctuation in accordance with modern practice. 


**Annotations:** Some contributions are annotated in pencil, probably by William Porden. Examples of such annotations are consecutive numbering and titles. Eleanor Anne Porden often noted acceptance of contributions, or the date on which they were to be read. Notes that add significant information have been formatted in an orange sans-serif typeface, thus: 

##### <span class="pencil">An Ode to Summer</span> 

**Corrections:** William Porden, the Senior Editor of the Attic Chest, occasionally made corrections to submissions, invariably improving on the original. On the assumption that the edited versions were those read out at meetings, these are indicated in green, with the original visible by hovering over the relevant text: 

This is an example of a textual correction. Hover over <span data-tippy="original version here" class="green">the green text</span> to see the original. 

**Lacunae:** Several pages are missing from the DRO scans. Sections of some pages are hidden behind folds in the manuscript paper. Such lacunae are indicated by red ellipses, with a mouse-hover comment indicating the problem. 

This is an example of missing text. Hover over <span data-tippy="Text missing" class="red">[ . . . ]</span> to see comment. 

**Illegibility:** Some Attic Chest contributors used ink that has faded alarmingly, occasionally beyond the limits of scan contrast adjustment. In a few cases text is obscured by ink blots or overwriting. Many contributors were familiar with Classical Greek and used it in footnotes. An attempt to render this Greek text will be made at a later stage of the transcription. Illegible text has been indicated as follows:

Illegible text is indicated by question marks. Hover over <span data-tippy="Illegible Greek text" class="red">[ ? ? ? ]</span> to see comment. 

**Authorship:** At the conclusion of each season the editors of the Attic Chest compiled a list of meetings, contributions, and authors. To facilitate searches of this archive, the names of confirmed authors have been added below their respective contributions, and the monolithic seasonal index has been divided into meetings. Internal links have been added where possible. It should be noted, however, that the indices do not always reflect the order or content of contributions contained in the archive.
