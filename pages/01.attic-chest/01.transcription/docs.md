The Attic Chest contributions exhibit inconsistency of spelling, capitalization, and punctuation, often in combination. Any attempt to reproduce these inconsistencies would make the transcriptions confusing at best, unreadable at worst. 


**Spelling:** Wherever practical, variant spellings have been replaced with modern equivalents, even where authors have shown a preference for spellings that match rhyme, e.g., ‘soul’ and ‘controul’ or ‘loud’ and ‘croud’. Spelling now considered American (e.g. ‘humor’, ‘favor’) has been preserved. 


**Capitalization:** Most Attic Chest contributors used capitalization for emphasis and visual effect. The same word can be found capitalized in one line and not in another. Adjectives are often capitalized whilst the nouns they modify are not. Where consistent capitalization is used for emphasis, this has been retained. Otherwise, capitalization has been modified to reflect modern usage. 


**Punctuation:** Logical punctuation was of minor concern to most Attic Chest contributors, as evinced by the proliferation of redundant commas and dashes. Quotation marks are sometimes used to indicate direct speech, but in a manner unfamiliar to a modern reader. An attempt has been made to standardize such punctuation in accordance with modern practice. 


**Annotations:** Some contributions are annotated in pencil, usually in William Porden’s hand. Examples of such annotations are sequential numbering and titles. Eleanor Anne Porden often noted acceptance of contributions, or the date on which they were to be read. Notes that add significant information have been formatted in an orange sans-serif typeface, thus: 

> <span class="pencil">An Ode to Summer</span> 

**Corrections:** William Porden occasionally made corrections to submissions, invariably improving on the original. On the assumption that the edited versions were those read out at meetings, these are indicated in green, with the original visible by hovering over the relevant text: 

> This is an example of a textual correction. Hover over <span data-tippy="original version here" class="green">the green text</span> to see the original. 

**Lacunae:** Some of the DRO scans are incomplete. Such lacunae are indicated by red ellipses, with a mouse-hover comment indicating the problem. 

> This is an example of missing text. Hover over <span data-tippy="Text missing" class="red">[ . . . ]</span> to see comment. 

Contributions not included in the Gell Collection are coloured grey in the list of authors. Thus:

> <span class="grey">Sonnet to a Friend → Mrs Jones</span>

**Illegibility:** Some Attic Chest contributors used ink that has faded alarmingly, occasionally beyond the limits of scan contrast adjustment. In a few cases text is obscured by ink blots or overwriting. Many contributors were familiar with classical Greek and used it in footnotes. An attempt to render this Greek text will be made at a later stage of the transcription. Illegible text has been indicated thus:

> Illegible text is indicated by question marks. Hover over <span data-tippy="Greek text" class="red">[ ? ? ? ]</span> to see comment. 

The editors of the Attic Chest were also troubled by illegibility, as noted in William Porden’s comments at the 28 April 1813 meeting:  

> We recommend it to some of our correspondents to be a little less sparing of their paper, and to lay in a fresh stock of pens and ink as the latter appears to have been too often watered already and their writing requires a microscope. Our friends must be sensible how much the spirit of their effusions must evaporate and the sense be lost while the reader is blundering over the hand, and endeavouring to make out the words.

**Authorship:** At the conclusion of each season the editors of the Attic Chest compiled a list of meetings, contributions, and authors. Not all authors were identified, and not all contributions were preserved. The names of acknowledged authors have been added as they appear in the archive.

It should be noted, however, that these attributions sometimes conflict with the handwriting, for reasons that are not clear.

**Fidelity to Original:** Some Attic Chest members formatted their contributions to imitate printed text or scribbled notes; others added illustrations. As the contributions were read out by Eleanor Anne Porden, it is not clear why members devoted so much time to the appearance of their contributions. No attempt has been made to reproduce such embellishments.
