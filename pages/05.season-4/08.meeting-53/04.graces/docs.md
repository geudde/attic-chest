<div class="author">Miss Vardill</div>

When brides a sugar’d cake divide,  
&emsp;Their emblem they contrive ill:  
Of all the compounds Love has tried,  
&emsp;The best is but a *Trifle!*  
Cool common-sense the basis makes,  
&emsp;With wit enough to stir ye;  
Like frosted rows of almond cakes  
&emsp;Well steep’d in sparkling sherry.  
Then Fancy whisks the custard up,  
&emsp;Good Temper helps to sweeten;  
But like the cream in Pleasure’s cup,  
&emsp;Wives sometimes should be *beaten*.  
Thus froth above and frost below  
&emsp;The The feast of love & life fill —   
Then take this trifling gift — you know  
&emsp;The best is but a *Trifle!*
