<div class="author">Miss Flaxman</div>

When the sun’s last parting beam,  
Faintly glimmers on the stream,  
And Fancy gives the waking dream;  
&emsp;I think of thee!  

When Cynthia her fair tresses laves,  
In the cooling sea green waves,  
Still faithful love each thought enslaves  
&emsp;And fills with thee!

Each sense on Fancy’s wing can soar  
For when upon the sandy shore  
Amid the deafening tempest’s roar,  
&emsp;Thy voice I hear!

And the stupendous mountains rise  
To hide thee from my longing eyes,  
All distance the fond heart defies  
&emsp;Thou still art near!

Oh yes, ’tis memory’s magic power,  
Which turns to sweet what else was sour,  
And gilds with joy the passing hour,  
&emsp;Tho’ far from thee!

Yes! dearest ’tis that inward light,  
By hope reflected, yet more bright  
That gives each vision of delight  
&emsp;The form of thee!
