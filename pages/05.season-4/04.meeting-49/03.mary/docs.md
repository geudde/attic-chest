<div class="author">Miss Porden</div>

Alas! how wretched those who prove  
The pangs of unrequited love  
Who mourn in silence and alone  
Nor dare to make their passion known.  
’Tis true love is the sweetest flower  
That graces hill, or mead, or bower  
But thorns its verdant stem surround  
And tears within its breast are found.  
Thrice happy who the flower have drawn  
Nor felt the venom of the thorn,  
Have stooped to taste its odours rare  
Nor soiled their bosoms with a tear.  
While I am doomed each lingering hour  
To feel the thorn nor find the flower  
To shed the tears of tender woe  
Nor hope’s delicious fragrance know,  
Yet dearest maid one tender sigh  
One glance of that expressive eye  
Could peace to this sad breast restore  
And joy impart unknown before.  
Blest with thy love each happy day  
On wings of joy should pass away.  
And as we roamed thro’ life’s gay bower  
We’d shun the thorn, but seize the flower  
And thou shouldst bless till life’s decline  
The morn that gave thee to thy Valentine.
