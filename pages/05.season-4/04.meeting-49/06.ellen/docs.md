When my bright Ellen treads the green,  
In all the pride of dress and mien;  
Averse to freedom, love, and play,  
The dazzling rival of the day:  
None other beauty strikes mine eye,  
The lilies droop, the roses die.  

But when disdaining art the fair,  
Assumes a soft engaging air;  
Mild as the opening morn of May  
Familiar, friendly, free and gay;  
The scene improves whereâ€™er she goes  
More sweetly smile the pink the rose.  

Oh lovely maid! propitious hear  
Nor seem thy lover insincere  
Pity a wild illusive flame,  
That varies objects still the same,  
And let their very changes prove,  
The never-varied force of love.
