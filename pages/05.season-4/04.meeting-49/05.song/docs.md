Och! when I came first to this fine London Town  
I peeped at the show shops and walked up and down  
Till I met with a fair, and this fair she was Brown  
Och I gave her a smile and she gave me a frown

Whach fal de rol

Then I told her my lineage was high of renown  
That my uncle O’Grogan was Mayor of the Town  
That my dear cousin Paddy had worn a furred gown  
So I thought I was quite a fair match for Miss Brown

Whach fal de rol

Och says I on my passion dear jewel look down  
You’re a pearl my fair crature and fit for a crown  
Take care of your own sir! says she with a frown  
And she gave me a look that had nigh knocked me down

Whach fal de rol

But still thy dear cratur thy nice bit of Brown  
Breaks a hole in my rest when to sleep I lie down  
On her smile I can live while I’m kilt by her frown  
Soon my ghost all in white will be shadow to Brown

Whach fal de rol
