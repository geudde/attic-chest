Alas what tale affrights Lothario’s ear,  
&emsp;Does Eborina quit these plains once more,  
I fondly hoped tho’ many a changing year,  
&emsp;To watch her walks by Ouse’s verdant shore.  

And tho’ forbade in tender strains to woo  
&emsp;Her virgin love, or weep her cruel scorn  
At distance still her beauteous form to view  
&emsp;At evening’s moonlight hour or blushing morn.  

With careless grace as blithe she trilled the lay  
&emsp;Her native woods or native meads among  
From some near copse to view the songstress gay  
&emsp;And in mute transport listen to her song.  

And if neglected love, the theme she chose  
&emsp;And some soft sigh should heave her tender breast  
To hope her pity for fictitious woes  
&emsp;Might warm her heart to greet a tenderer guest.

Sometimes I hoped the copse’s verdant screen  
&emsp;Unfaithful might my hidden form betray  
Seen by the maid, but not with anger seen  
&emsp;In seeming ignorance she pursued her lay.

Alas those dreams are fled with her who gave  
&emsp;A richer verdure to each sylvan scene  
With brighter crystal decked the sparkling wave  
&emsp;And made the sky more lovely, more serene.

Now she is gone no more can nature please  
&emsp;Or artificial beauties soothe my woe,  
No glance but hers can give Lothario ease  
&emsp;No other smile on me can joy bestow.  

Yet still with lonely steps I frequent rove  
&emsp;Thro’ each loved dell the maid has trod before  
And memory shall endear the vale, the grove,  
&emsp;Tho’ smiling hope may gild the scene no more.
