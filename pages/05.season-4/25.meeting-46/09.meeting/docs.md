<div class="author">Miss Vardill</div>

Among the Muses and the Graces  
Truth, Wit & Friendship took their places:  
Wit first unclasp’d her velvet cloak,  
Sipp’d her ambrosial cup & spoke.  
“On ev’ry New-Year’s day, you know,  
Gifts to our fav’rite Fair we owe;  
But ten years since, she claim’d my store —   
I, for my part, can give no more.”  
A kindred Muse replied & smil’d  
“We knew your ELLEN when a child!  
Oft in her Nurse’s lap we sought her:  
We touch’d her soul with attic fire,  
We dipp’d her pencil, tun’d her lyre;  
Of all our trophies she disposes,  
Her casket all our gems encloses:  
We gave our tokens long ago,  
The, Sisters! what can we bestow?  
But Truth & Joy with Friendship live,  
Has Friendship nothing left to give?”

Mild Friendship said, “I seldom reach  
The flights of thought & flow’rs of speech;  
My vestal fires in silence glow,  
My voice is soft, my step is slow:  
Uncertain roses crown the Nine,  
The constant amaranth is mine!  
I lend the eye its lambent light,  
I give the smiles which joy invite,  
The speech whose true expression warms,  
The grace which more than beauty charms!  
All these are ELLEN’s — but to-night  
When Mirth & Fancy claim their right,  
This brief & simple verse I bring,  
At ELLEN’s shrine my offering:  
Our favour’d ELLEN never scorns  
What Friendship gives, & Truth adorns!”

Grave Truth replied, “No gifts are fairer,  
But Muses! who shall be the bearer?  
Our servants now are grown so stupid —   
Go, call the Graces’ footboy Cupid!  
He too is pert & apt to roam —   
The urchin never stays at home;  
Our phrases all he learns by rote,  
And begs or steals in Friendship’s coat.  
His own lac’d livery, they say,  
He lends impostors ev’ry day:  
Then, Sister! scorn the truant elf!  
I’ll be your messenger myself —   
My coat (for twenty ages worn)  
Is short, I own, & rough, & torn;  
To Wit & Fancy oft I lend it,  
But Wit & Fancy never mend it.  
Muses! your choicest gifts combine,  
To me the precious charge assign!  
Secure beneath enchanted locks  
I’ll hide them in an attic box;  
Whene’er the sacred lid she lifts  
Let ELLEN find the Muses’ gifts —   
Gifts by their sister-Graces plac’d,  
By Wit, & Truth & Friendship grac’d:  
Apollo’s self shall be her guest,  
And Pleasure crown her ATTIC CHEST!”
