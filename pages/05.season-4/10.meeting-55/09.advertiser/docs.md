<div class="author">Miss Porden</div>

How bright is Hope’s enlivening ray,  
&emsp;How sweet her airy smile  
But soon her radiance fades away,  
&emsp;She lures but to beguile.

To Birchall’s with delighted speed  
&emsp;Drawn by her words I flew  
She said to meet my much loved maid,  
&emsp;But false the joys she drew.

Another’s was the form, the face,  
&emsp;The voice, the sparkling eye  
And had she shone with angle grace,  
&emsp;Still, ’twas not Emily.

No other maid in Damon’s breast,  
&emsp;The subtle flame can more,  
The heart that once true love confest,  
&emsp;Again can never love.

Then pardon, gentle maid that I  
&emsp;Reject your proffered hand,  
When hearts their soft accord deny  
&emsp;A chain is Hymen’s band.

And pity him whose lovesick eyes  
&emsp;Are to your beauties blind  
Whom Hope still loves to tantalize,  
&emsp;With what he ne’er shall find.

Damon
