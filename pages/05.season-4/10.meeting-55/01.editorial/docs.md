The advertising lady and her several suitors appear to have concluded their courtships, but whether to their mutual satisfaction or not we shall not say. The interview at Birchalls appears to have been punctually attended, and the behaviour of the gentlemen as well as the lady has been well detailed by one of our correspondents whose curiosity induced him to remain there nearly the whole day.

Alopex has not favoured us with any contributions for this evening, and we suppose he is either ill or in dudgeon. The pieces for which we have been indebted to our other correspondents did not arrive time enough to be noticed with the attention they deserve.
