Those humble flow’rs which briefly bloom  
&emsp;May ask a sunbeam’s aid;  
But nobler blossoms yield perfume  
&emsp;And live in midnight shade.  

Love, in its gay meridian bright,  
&emsp;Oft dazzles with its blaze:  
But modest Friendship’s lunar light  
&emsp;The constant eye repays.  

To sainted “urn” or festive bow’r  
&emsp;Next mellow light she lends;  
Soft music waits her sober hour,  
&emsp;And *balmy dew* descends.

Beneath the fiery pomp of noon  
&emsp;The fainting pilgrim sighs;  
But safe beneath the placid *moon*  
&emsp;In peaceful sleep he lies!  

Reflected in her gentle face  
&emsp;The absent sun is seen;  
And oft departed love we trace  
&emsp;In *amity* serene.

When Passion’s glowing orb is set,  
&emsp;The *moon* of friendship reigns:  
Life’s vanish’d splendors we forget —   
&emsp;A softer light remains!
