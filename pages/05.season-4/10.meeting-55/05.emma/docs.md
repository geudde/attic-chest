<div class="author">Miss Porden</div>

You ask me who the maid I love,  
&emsp;And think you I’ll her name reveal,  
Whom true affection bids me prove  
&emsp;From you most anxious to conceal.  

Yet here her faithful portrait view;  
&emsp;Nor think the painter lent it grace,  
For flattery here would vainly try,  
&emsp;T’enhance her mien, her form, her face.  

Fair as the mountain’s drifted snows,  
&emsp;And ah! to my true love as cold;  
Yet blushing like the vermil rose,  
&emsp;When first its fragrant leaves unfold.  

Mild as the Zephyrs vernal sigh;  
&emsp;And gentle as the tender dove,  
Gay as the lark that sing on high;  
&emsp;When Sol’s first radiance tips the grove.

Artless as yon silver tide,  
&emsp;Which as its crystal waters flow,  
By every curious eye descried,  
&emsp;Reveals the sparkling sand below.  

Such is my love — her eye of blue,  
&emsp;Bright as the diamond’s lucid ray;  
Now shines with “Pity’s pearly dew,”  
&emsp;Now like the changing opal gay.  

And is she then not yet betray’d,  
&emsp;By modesty concealed alone —   
For all but you, too lovely Maid,  
&emsp;Had for yourself the picture known.
