##### To the true object of her hopes and wishes

O! come awa, come awa,  
Come awa to me Willie!  
Gin ye’re inclin’d to speak ye’re mind  
Ye’ll find a match in me Willie

O luze me on ye’re saft blue ee  
It often luiks on me Willie!  
Ilk kindly glance gars my heart dance  
When fondly fix’d on me Willie  

A’ither suitors I’ll despise  
Gif ye but fancy me Willie  
Ye’re ee! now on my bosom lies  
Ye’re ee! in effigie Willie  

Oh could that ee but see my heart  
It then wad till to ye Willie  
What gars me blush while I impart  
How great my love for ye Willie.

No long since syne I’gan to pine  
Nae man seem’d made for me Willie  
But a’ my care is blown to air  
Sweet hope now smiles on me Willie.

Then Willie! Willie! come awa  
Nae time to lose ha we Willie  
I sit and sigh — nae heart ha’ I  
It’s flown awa to ye Willie.
