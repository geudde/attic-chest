<span class="title">Sylvius, Cittus, & Critickius</span>

Beneath the shade a spreading beech displays,  
Sylvius and Cittus sung their rival lays;  
That lov’d the rural seat, and this the town,  
But both contended for the poet’s crown.  
As they disputed in alternate strains,  
*This* boasted loveless ease, *that* wail’d his am’rous pains.  
High in the midst the sage Critickius sate  
To judge between them in the sharp debate;  
And first sung Sylvius, *lover* marked by fate.

<span class="title">Sylvius</span>

Of all the soul-entrancing themes  
That swell the youthful poet’s dreams,  
&emsp;None does so oft employ the votive verses,  
As, to what’s sweetest, best, most rare,  
His beauteous idol to compare,  
&emsp;And in symbolic strain her praise rehearse.

The drooping violet — the blushing rose —   
The lily pale — her beauties oft disclose;  
&emsp;Each flow’r by turns that sips the ev’ning dew,  
And oft the fleecy clouds, or silver moon,  
Or sun triumphant blazing in high noon,  
&emsp;With fancied semblance bless the lover’s view.

But not the blushing rose nor lily pale,  
Nor fleecy clouds, nor silver moon, avail  
&emsp;To deck the verse that sings Pastora’s praise;  
Her matchless beauty, unaffected grace,  
And all the varied wonders of her face,  
&emsp;
Each vain comparison leave behind —   
But who the golden treasures of her mind  
&emsp;By apt similitude shall e’er display?  
To sing of these my ardent muse aspires,  
But the bright theme a nobler verse requires,  
&emsp;And lost in dumb despair I close the feeble lay.

<span class="title">Cittus</span>

With aching brains and well-scratch’d pate,  
With my five wits I ne’er hold long debate,  
&emsp;By apt comparison to sing my idol’s praise;  
Nor do I gaze the clouds, nor all forlorn  
Range o’er the flowerbeds and verdant lawn  
&emsp;To seek an emblem of her charms wherewith the eke my lays.  

For who that walks our London streets,  
But ev’ry moment some strange object meets,  
&emsp;(If not engross’d by love) which straightway strikes his fancy?  
The shopman’s treasures prominently gay,  
Glitt’ring thro’ windows bright in proud array,  
&emsp;Quick to his roving mind recall the beauteous Nancy.  

And those, who burn’st in Cupid’s flames,  
And call’st they idol by a thousand names  
&emsp;Of all that’s lovely, fanciful and tender,  
Come taste the dashing pleasures of the town,  
With us in wine these odd vagaries drown,  
&emsp;And ten to one out of your head we’ll send her!

<span class="title">Sylvius</span>

To my disdainful Fair this strain I sung,  
And pleas’d she listen’d to my tuneful tongue:  
The melting maid forgot her proud disdain,  
And sweetly own’d she pitied Sylvius pain.  

&emsp;“With love my hapless heart is beating,  
&emsp;&emsp;There passion reigns;  
&emsp;With love my hapless heart is beating;  
&emsp;&emsp;Assuage its pains!”

&emsp;“Alas! my plaints are all in vain!  
&emsp;&emsp;You still deride  
&emsp;And laugh to scorn my am’rous pain,  
&emsp;&emsp;With cruel pride.”  

&emsp;“Cruel! this rig’rous scorn no more  
&emsp;&emsp;Sylvius can bear;  
&emsp;Thy killing slights he’ll still deplore  
&emsp;&emsp;In dumb despair!”

&emsp;“With love my hapless heart is beating,  
&emsp;&emsp;There passion reigns;  
&emsp;With love my hapless heart is beating;  
&emsp;&emsp;Assuage its pains!!!”

<span class="title">Cittus</span>

Once at our Club I quizz’d these waking dreams,  
The tender languish of these lovesick themes;  
And from all quarters warm applauses gain’d,  
As I in numbers meet this truth maintain’d — 

&emsp;“The man’s an ass  
&emsp;&emsp;Who blows out his brains  
&emsp;For a scornful lass  
&emsp;&emsp;Who flouts him for his pains:    
&emsp;For one who her smiles dispenses,  
&emsp;Love, joy, admiration ecstasy, whence is;  
&emsp;I forgive him if he lose his senses:  
&emsp;&emsp;But to blow out his brains  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;For a scornful lass  
&emsp;&emsp;Who derides his pains —   
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Believe me, that man’s an ass!!!”

<span class="title">Critickius</span>

Oh how shall I award the prize?  
Let both divide the crown;  
Sylvius could raise a mortal to the skies,  
And Cittus bring an Angel down.
