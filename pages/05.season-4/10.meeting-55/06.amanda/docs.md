’Tis done — I take you at your word —   
&emsp;Receive my recantation!  
For faith, the beauties I adored  
&emsp;Were all my own creation.  
Last month of love and you I talk’d  
&emsp;And swore your smile was heaven —   
But when in Birchall’s shop I walk’d,  
My phoenix seem’d a raven!

“Above the rose’s fading bloom  
&emsp;The olive holds its station;  
Above the blossoms’ brief perfume  
&emsp;The fruit claims estimation:”  
Amanda! thus in tuneful strain  
&emsp;You made a sage reflexion;  
For from the rarest fruits you gain  
&emsp;Your never-changed complexion!

What saffron tints enrich your cheek  
&emsp;Your quondam lover well knows —   
The olive triumphs in your neck,  
&emsp;The plumb adorns your elbows — 

Forgive, Amanda, if my taste  
&emsp;Affronts your rhyme and reason;  
But fruits so comically plac’d  
&emsp;To me seem out of season.  

Once as the sun-beam charms our eyes  
&emsp;I thought your smile could cheer me —   
For like the sun in northern skies  
&emsp;You were not then too near me. 

Yet with and truth my taste oppose;  
&emsp;I own ’tis wondrous silly  
To leave a nutmeg for a rose,  
&emsp;And orange for a lily!  

And why should humble red and white  
&emsp;Of beauty be the sureties?  
One colour may one eye delight  
&emsp;But every one in yours is!

While orange tints enrich your hands  
&emsp;What patriot will not court you?  
The purple of your lip commands  
&emsp;All King’s men to support you.

And were your eyes as Ellen’s bright  
&emsp;A candle would be brighter;  
Or was you hand as Mira’s white  
&emsp;This paper would be whiter.  

No more dame Nature’s favors claim,  
&emsp;Most wisely she denies them;    
Those favors would be lent in vain  
&emsp;To you who never prize them.  

Why give the arts of stealing hearts  
&emsp;To you who always doubt them?  
Why give a claim to love or fame  
&emsp;To one so blest without them?
