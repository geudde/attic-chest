<span class="title">Serenade</span>

Silence now the air pervading  
&emsp;Scarce a breath disturbs her reign;  
Hark my lute her power invading,  
&emsp;Bids the echoes wake again.

Where yon vines so thickly cluster,  
&emsp;O’er yon arbour’s light alcove,  
Shining in the moon’s soft lustre,  
&emsp;Lies the object of my love.

Do you sleep ungrateful maiden,  
&emsp;Careless of your lover’s pain;  
O’er whose eyes, by sorrow laden  
&emsp;Sleep forgets her balmy reign.  

Or to his remembrance waking,  
&emsp;Do you equal passion feel,  
Oh then now, your couch forsaking  
&emsp;To your trellised window steal.  

Let not fear your mind encumber,  
&emsp;That our foes should watchful prove,  
Every eye is sealed in slumber  
&emsp;Save the eyes that wake to love.

O’er yon tide, so softly flowing,  
&emsp;See the moon’s mild radiance falls,  
Gilds yon vale, where olives growing,  
&emsp;Shroud yon convent’s sainted walls.  

O’er yon grove of orange playing,  
&emsp;Zephyrs load with sweets the air,  
Rise, my love, the scene surveying,  
&emsp;Nature’s loveliest prospects share.

Hark! her latticed door unfolding  
&emsp;Fair Elvira seeks the bower,  
These fond eyes her charms beholding  
&emsp;Soon shall bless the happy hour.

Hark! her soft guitar resounding  
&emsp;Breathes upon the midnight air,  
Its soft notes to mine responding,  
&emsp;Here ye gentle Zephyrs bear.  

Hark! her mellow voice uniting  
&emsp;Steals upon my ravished ear  
Every finer sense delighting,  
&emsp;Hush — my heart be still and hear.

From yon shaded terrace stealing,  
&emsp;What sweet joys those strains impart,  
That Alfonso’s love revealing,  
&emsp;Sink into Elvira’s heart.  

Why her tender feeling wounding,  
&emsp;Can you doubt her constant love,  
Love, which all the scene surrounding,  
&emsp;Must to your fond memory prove.

Ah! should our harsh foes preventing,  
&emsp;Still our faithful hearts divide,  
And ingenious in tormenting,  
&emsp;Fix me as another’s bride.

From their furious rage excluded,  
&emsp;I will seek that convent’s cell,  
From the world and thee secluded,  
&emsp;There a cloistered virgin dwell.  

Though from thee dear youth to sever,  
&emsp;Then may cost me many a tear,  
Yet we do not part for ever,  
&emsp;And a happier world is near.

But the harbinger of morning  
&emsp;Hark that convent matins bell  
Hence, or days bright radiance dawning  
&emsp;Will they lingering steps reveal.

May the holy Virgin guard thee  
&emsp;Safe from every prying eye,  
Let no tender thoughts retard thee,  
&emsp;Hence, adieu, Alfonso — fly.
