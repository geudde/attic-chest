##### Birchall’s Shop

How blythe the swains on May-Day morn  
As through the streets they hop  
Of ancient pastimes think with scorn  
And hie to Birchall’s shop.

But not on music’s sweetest sound  
One single thought they drop,  
Those powerful charms are to be found  
In Birchall’s music shop!

A siren there directs their eyes  
And bids them kindly stop  
With pity, hear her mournful sighs!  
Resound through Birchall’s shop.  

Each beau advancing full of glee  
Of *fun* expects a crop  
But music only can they see  
Display’d in Birchall’s shop. 

Birchall amazed! stands wond’ring by  
Whilst belles around him pop  
Enuiring for “the soft blue eye”  
Not known in Birchall’s shop.

At length a maid with sable plume  
And form much like a mop  
With ’kerchief white to cheer the gloom  
Advanc’d through Birchall’s shop.  

On each bold youth she turns her eyes —   
But mournfully they drop  
The blue-eyed chief, for whom she sighs  
Is not in Birchall’s shop.  

In vain appointments has she made!  
Advertisements has written  
The swain she seeks does all evade  
He’s not with passion smitten!  

Her ’kerchief white to tatters torn  
With waving to and fro  
Was ever damsel so forlorn  
O! whither shall she go?  

Music has charms to melt no more!
