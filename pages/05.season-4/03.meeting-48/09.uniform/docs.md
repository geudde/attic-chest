<span class="title">Lines on the Projected Alterations in the Uniform of the British Cavalry</span>

Hail chivalry, whose influence bland,  
&emsp;Enlightening many a barbarous age,  
Has often checked the murderous hand,  
&emsp;And soothed stern valour’s iron rage.

Bade e’en Mahomet’s lawless crowd  
&emsp;Submissive own thy gentle sway,  
And feudal lords and barons proud  
&emsp;With bending neck thy laws obey.

Enraptur’d, on thy glorious page  
&emsp;Poetic fancy loves to hang  
And see again the battle rage  
&emsp;And hear the martial trumpet clang.  

To dwell on noble deeds of arms,  
&emsp;That proved each warrior’s matchless might  
And many a lovely damsel’s charms  
&emsp;That captive held each valiant knight.  

And hark a voice from Britain’s land  
&emsp;Where freedom yet maintains her throne  
Freedom so long thy bosom friend  
&emsp;And long to to other climes unknown.  

She bids with voice of magic power  
&emsp;Thy martial spirit wake again  
Sad Europe’s trampled rights restore,  
&emsp;And break oppression’s iron chain.  

She bids thee come, and bring with thee,  
&emsp;Religion, drest in angel grace,  
The smiling cherub courtesy  
&emsp;Resistless valour’s dauntless face.

And all the noble band of old,  
&emsp;That graced in regal state thy train;  
Honour and faith and courage bold,  
&emsp;And emulation rise again.  

And see the warlike train appears,  
&emsp;And arms our youth for deadly fight  
I hear the martial clash of **shears**  
&emsp;I see the **helmets** glittering bright

Proud valour fires each **mailed** breast,  
&emsp;And prudence leads the noble train  
And sends them forth in terror drest  
&emsp;Albion to guard to rescue Spain.  

Ten thousand thunders roll around,  
&emsp;Ten thousand lightnings break the gloom,  
Of smoky clouds that hide the ground,  
&emsp;And speak their rash opposers’ doom.

With fancy’s wild prophetic eye  
&emsp;The triumph of their arms I view  
See Gallia’s vanquished legions fly  
&emsp;And Europe’s honour sprout anew.  
 
See liberty assume her power  
&emsp;While all her subjects bless her reign  
Ausonia, Belgia, Gaul, restore  
&emsp;And throw her arms across the main.  

While our proud navies scour the sea,  
&emsp;And all with grateful hearts confess,  
Britain their source of liberty  
&emsp;And guardian of their happiness.  

And seek anew each sacred fane  
&emsp;In thankful adoration there,  
The happy nations bow again  
&emsp;And joy draws forth the pious tear.
