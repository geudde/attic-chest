Miss Vardill

When first by gentle Ouse I stray’d  
Two crimson cheeks my fancy sway’d  
But now of flaming read afraid,  
&emsp;The nymph I love is Brown:  
For brown alike in light or shade  
Of red or white disdains the aid  
Yet while by gentle Ouse I strayed  
&emsp;The fairest maid was Brown.

In dark the fairest primrose lies  
The summer bud’s vermilion flies  
But time which dims the rarest dyes  
&emsp;Improves the worth of Brown:  
For far-fam’d red the soldier sighs  
The sailor asks an azure prize,  
But brown delights a lover’s eyes  
&emsp;His brightest thought is Brown.
