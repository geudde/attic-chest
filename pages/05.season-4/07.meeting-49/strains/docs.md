Not in a lover’s humble strains  
I ask a dimple for my pains  
I hate the smile which other seek  
And wish thy frown may last a week.  
Destructive fair one was it well  
O’er all my wits to cast a spell  
To close my ear, to bind my tongue  
While mighty music round me rung?  
Lost in the concert’s magic maze  
I paid to hear and stood to gaze!  
When Handel swell’d in strains sublime  
My faithless foot forgot its time!  
Alas! my busy heart beat true  
Tho’ all its time was lost on you.  
Chapeaux and elbows round me pressed  
But ’twas the beauty bruised my breast  
When flaming tapers sound distill’d  
And wax my bristling tresses filled,  
My martyr’d coat I scorn’d to wipe  
And stood of melting love a type!  
As open mouth’d the pigeon dies  
Lur’d by the serpent’s fatal eyes.
For thee with more than Roman pride  
My mouth received the scalding tide  
But thine, not worth my true love’s half  
Repaid the blister with — a laugh!  
Thus proud one may thy beauty’s ray  
Waste, like a torch of wax away!  
May he who loves and loves thee best  
Be robb’d of wit and speech and rest:  
Like me forget to guard his coat  
And feel a blister in his throat;  
While fear and doubt to move your pity  
Seal up his lips like spermaceti!
