Forgive sweet maid, that one unknown  
&emsp;Or else by thee forgotten long  
Now dares to make his passion known  
&emsp;And here address his simple song.  

Yet on this day is love allowed  
&emsp;(Tho’ friendship oft his garb may borrow)  
Distinguished from the vulgar crowd  
&emsp;To tell his artless tale of sorrow.  

Canst thou sweet maid the time recall  
&emsp;The happy but the fatal hour  
When at the mirth inspiring ball  
&emsp;I felt thy modest beauty’s power.  

Yet ’twas not beauty caused alone,  
&emsp;My low-drawn sigh, my ardent gaze  
Nor is it now to worth unknown  
&emsp;My tender heart its tribute pays.  

No, when of heavenly harmony  
&emsp;We spoke thy voice so sweetly told  
Our hearts were strung in sympathy  
&emsp;Our minds confessed a kindred mould.  

Thy thoughts, thy tastes so just I found  
&emsp;That while I listened rapture fraught  
Love o’er my heart his garland wound  
&emsp;I in his flowery chains was caught.

Then pity his destructive rage,  
&emsp;Let kindred chains our hearts entwine  
Oh deign my torments to assuage,  
&emsp;And be dear maid my Valentine.
