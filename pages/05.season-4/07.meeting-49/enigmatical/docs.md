Well! tho’ St Valentine’s is past  
The claims of Ellen longer last:  
Science, by wit and taste befriended  
Is every day by *me* attended!  
Yes; when from Ellen’s jet-black eye  
The frolic fires of youth shall fly:  
When with the bloom of gay sixteen  
No more her dimpled cheek is seen;  
When the fresh rosebud’s balmy dews  
No more her damask lip suffuse,  
Her ready smile and converse bland  
Shall more than beauty’s pow’r command!  
Then mine her active hand shall arm,  
With *me* her Attic wit shall charm:  
Let *me* her soft commands fulfill  
And Ellen shall be sov’reign still!  

On you, fair fav’rite of the fates!  
A true, unpurchas’d servant waits:  
From turban’d Turkey’s clime I come,  
On orator, tho’ deaf and dumb!  
My ink-black visage well might suit  
The office of a Turkish mute;  
But tho’ my slender face is grim,  
My coat is smooth, my shape is slim.

Not Roncevalle’s nor Mancha’s knight  
With bolder constancy could fight;  
To prove my zeal and shew my wit  
My tongue is worn, my heart is split!  
For you a thousand times I feel  
The wounds of unrelenting steel:  
And twice in every circling moon,  
I humbly bring my votive boon:  
A boon of little price, ’tis true,  
For all its worth depends on you!  
But if the humble gift you take,  
I’ll be a servant for your sake;  
And ev’ry year devoutly sign  
Myself your truest

&mdash; **Valentine!**
