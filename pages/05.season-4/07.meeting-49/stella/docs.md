St Valentine! be thou my muse,  
To thee dear saint, I pray,  
Erato, doth *her* aid refuse,  
“Love” *she* says “claims the day.  
Let friendship wait a future hour  
At leisure, I may own *her* power!”  
&emsp;Forbid it, all the powers above!  
Resist that all-usurping love,  
Others may let him gain his ends,  
*My* pen, *my* heart, is still my friend’s.  
&emsp;Mine is the tributary song  
Oft raised to my dear Stella’s name  
To her, I’ve seen amidst the Attic throng  
Her bright eye kindling at the voice of fame.
