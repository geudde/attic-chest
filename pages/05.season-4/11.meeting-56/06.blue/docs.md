After the visit of some of our Attic belles, it was my good fortune to find the enclosed on the staircase and have taken the liberty of sending you a copy of it, as it appears to me to be the song about which so much fruitless enquiry has been made.

I am sir with much respect

Your obedient servant

Oh sweet are Damon’s vows to hear,  
&emsp;And soft is Strephon’s sigh;  
But sweeter to his Anne dear,  
&emsp;Her William’s bright blue eye.

Tho’ Colin’s eye of hazel hue,  
&emsp;May keener rays supply;  
More softly beams the eye of Blue,  
&emsp;My William’s own blue eye.  

Then William, while we still are true  
&emsp;Let all their malice try,  
Still let my looks enrapture you  
&emsp;As me they bright blue eye.
