Assist me Nymphs of song divine,  
&emsp;With all your fervour fire my lays  
Your soul should dwell in every line,  
&emsp;That dares attempt your Anna’s praise.  

Ah could my strain like hers but flow  
&emsp;Pathetic sprightly, sweet sublime,  
Long should my verdant laurels grow  
&emsp;Nor dread the wintry rage of Time.  

Hence Flattery, deck some idol’s shrine  
&emsp;With all thy tinsel’s gaudy glare,  
Truth here unfolds her golden mine  
&emsp;And here shall lawful incense bear.  

And here how vain were Flattery’s aid,  
&emsp;When Truth’s pure gems would hers surpass,  
In Phoebus ray as planets fade,  
&emsp;As diamonds shame the brittle glass.  

Smooth as the river’s silver stream,  
&emsp;Fair Anna’s liquid numbers flow  
And sparkling as the solar beam  
&emsp;With Wit’s Ætherial brilliance glow.

With cadence musically wild,  
&emsp;Like Zephyrs on the Eolian lyre,  
Or her own strains, that care beguiled  
&emsp;And stole Apollo’s tuneful fire.

The pearls of fancy deck her lay  
&emsp;There learning’s polished diamond shines  
While taste has cut the dross away,  
&emsp;And pure religion’s touch refines.

And see! as now with sparkling eye,  
&emsp;Of *Human Life* the joys she sings,  
Ætherial forms around her fly,  
&emsp;And hang in transport o’er the strings.  

Ye youth that flutter life away  
&emsp;Learn from her song how vain your joy  
And think of pleasure’s purer day  
&emsp;Eternal bliss beyond the sky.

And learn from her, ye cynics sour,  
&emsp;Learn to be innocently gay,  
Learn to enjoy the festive hour,  
&emsp;For joy despised, disdains to stay.

Yet why! oh why to Anna’s name  
&emsp;Should I attune my humble lays?  
When every ear has heard her fame  
&emsp;And every voice proclaims her praise.  

And hark! e’en now her festive call,  
&emsp;Her friends invite to join the dance,  
See graceful thro’ the lighted hall,  
&emsp;With measured step the Nymph advance.

But friendship’s offering, if sincere,  
&emsp;Will ever win her ready smile,  
Then let that smile reward my care,  
&emsp;The sweetest guerdons of my toil.
