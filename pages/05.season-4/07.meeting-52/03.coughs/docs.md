Of coughs and colds these pages treat  
To save you from a winding sheet

Take first, a recipe for cough,  
At which, who heed it not may laugh.

Well powdered snakeroot first obtain  
An hour in boiling water lay,  
Three drams to half a pint, then strain  
Thro’ paper thin the dregs away.

An ounce and half, when thus refined  
A drachm of simple oxymel,  
With poppy syrup well combined  
Just half a drachm, and thou’lt be well.

Yet in six parts the draught divide  
At morn, at noon, at night, to swallow —   
A fasting hour on either side,  
And rosy health will surely follow  

A fane there is in Oxford Street  
To Hebe sacred, served by *Bel*:  

Lo! *Dragon* sickness licks his feet  
For recipes he mixes well [^1]

For colds, another doctor — pills  
Administers of friendly squills  
With Ipecacuanha joined  
And a mild opiate well combined  
But in what portions mingled — he  
Will tell you for a moderate fee.

[^1]: Tho’ I’ve not seen it, I divine  
Bel and the Dragon, are the sign.
