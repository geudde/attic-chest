<div class="author">Miss Vardill</div>

Yes! Love a Sybil’s book possesses,  
But scarce one spotless leaf remains;  
Time ev’ry glowing line effaces,  
And oft a tear its beauty stains!  
But friendship boasts a safer treasure —   
A Chest with guiltless trophies fraught;  
She lends the key to Wit & Pleasure,  
And guards the gifts by Wisdom brought.  
There, by refining Taste selected,  
Lie gems from Fancy’s purest mines:  
There from oblivion’s dust protected,  
Wit, like Etruria’s marble shines.  
But first with skillful hand she places  
Truth’s modest opal in her store;  
Her touch the dross of Science chases,  
And lifts to light its secret ore.  
’Midst treasures won from wits and sages  
This humble gift may entrance claim;  
Tho’, like the coin of long-lost ages,  
It bears no semblance of a name.  
This gift, with richer tributes blending  
Their brightness and their praise may share;  
As dew on beds of pearl descending,  
May seem a kindred brilliant there.
