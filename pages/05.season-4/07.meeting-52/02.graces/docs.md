##### or, The Fair Advertiser

When fair ones and gay ones for love advertise  
’Tis time for the God to send speedy supplies:  
Then freshen your roses, your ringlets prepare,  
Tomorrow ill bring the reward of your care.  

But who comes tomorrow? The Muses’ delight!  
Caprices and favors like theirs I write:  
The primrose and pink in my countenance shew  
That mine is the beauty intended for you.  

’Tis true I make fools; but the wisest declare  
They copy me oft in my humour and air;  
Like you I bring gladness whenever I’m seen  
My frowns are so short and my smiles so serene.  

The quarrels of lovers with me never fear,  
I stay a short month only once in a year:  
From sweet expectations your happiness borrow,  
Awake with the lark, and behold me tomorrow!
