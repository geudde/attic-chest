Soft as the hand which guides the quill,  
Is true affection’s magic skill;  
With mingled touches, light and strong  
The swift inscriber glides along:  
Time may the fairest strokes efface,  
But ever leaves a soften’d trace!

Soon bruis’d, neglected, and decay’d,  
The Pen denies its ready aid;  
But tho’ to silent dust consign’d,  
It leaves its graceful print behind:  
And thus tho’ buried Friendship sleeps,  
The faithful heart its record keeps!  

The Crow, to lovers constant still,  
Lent from her wing this tender quill:  
For once, as ancient tales proclaim,  
Coronis was a tell-tale dame;  
And oft her busy feathers prove  
Too apt interpreters of love!

Ah! let my name remain untold!  
The tell-tale would too much unfold!  
For still, perhaps, with jealous care,  
Apollo guards his fav’rite fair;  
The Crow may yet his pow’r discover,  
And once again betray your lover!

’Tis not a mighty change of nature  
To give a *crow’s shape* to a *prater;*  
And therefore ’twould no greatness show  
To change a *Lover* to a *Crow:*  
But ’tis of pow’r a wondrous use,  
To lend a Crow’s quill to a *Goose!*
