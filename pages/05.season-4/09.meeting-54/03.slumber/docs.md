> Southey’s Curse of Kehama

What tho’ soft slumber oft denies,  
To shed her sweets on tear swollen eyes,  
And often freely will bestow  
On those who sorrow never know,  
To mourners e’er her soothing balm,  
Possesses still a double charm.  
It gives the aching eye relief  
And lightens half the bosom’s grief,  
<span data-tippy="Oh who that weeps, shall see" class="green">That mourner who perceives</span> her nigh,  
<span data-tippy="And" class="green">Will</span> bid the sweet intruder fly.

Kehama’s curse might long deny,  
Her hand to seal Ladurlad’s eye,  
In sweet oblivion steep his pain,  
His burning heart and burning brain.  
Yet had she in that torturing hour,  
Come, reckless of the tyrant’s power  
Had Kailyal or Ladurlad chased,  
The pleasing power that brought them rest,  
No, they had hailed thee, “Friend of Woe”  
And still delighted called thee so.
