The rose, when dews of night are shed  
That folds its leaves and bows its head  
Shall to the genial beams of day  
Its blushing beauties full display  
Ah! when shall Celia’s beauties rise  
Again to bless these longing eyes?  
Eyes that must close in endless night,  
If she delay to charm their sight!  

She comes, the lovely virgin see!  
She comes again to love and me,  
Before the radiance of her eye  
The gloomy shades of sorrows fly.  
Not so reviving, morning’s light  
To flowers that wither, chill’d by night,  
As she sweet hopes her smiles impart  
To cheer with joy my drooping heart!

Philander
