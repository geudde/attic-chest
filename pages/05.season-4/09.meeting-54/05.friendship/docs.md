Friendship, minister of Pleasure!  
&emsp;Reason’s pupil, Nature’s pride,  
Here diffuse thy boundless treasure,  
&emsp;Here ’midst kindred hearts preside!  
Friendship, first and richest blessing  
&emsp;Heav’n on peevish man bestows!  
Light of Life’s uncertain morning,  
&emsp;Solace of its wintry close!

In the woe-worn heart’s recesses  
&emsp;Still some fond remembrance swells;  
While it yet its warmth possesses  
&emsp;There thy sacred relic dwells!  
Ere that heart in death reposes  
&emsp;Oft it fondly calls thee near;  
While the dying eye uncloses,  
&emsp;Still it asks thy balmy tear!

From the Arab’s pearl-pav’d fountains,  
&emsp;From Peruvia’s golden dome,  
Why to Albion’s misty mountains  
&emsp;Turns the wearied wand’rer home?  
Still for social pleasures praying,  
&emsp;There his warmest wishes end:  
There his faithful Fancy straying  
&emsp;Paints his Cottage and his Friend!

As the rose, tho’ stripp’d and faded,  
&emsp;Long its precious essence gives,  
Friendship, tho’ by Death invaded,  
&emsp;Still thy purest spirit lives!  
Not for crowns — let monarchs prize them,  
&emsp;Not for fame my pray’rs ascend:  
Give me but what Fate denies them —   
&emsp;Give me quiet and a Friend!
