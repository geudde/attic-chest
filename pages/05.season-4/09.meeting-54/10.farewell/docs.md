The moment’s come with sorrows rife;  
&emsp;Adieu, sweet Maid, adieu!  
Now shall I drag a weary life  
&emsp;Far, far, from love and you?  
No more my days will joyous be,  
&emsp;Content I shall be never;  
&emsp;For ah! who knows if ever  
&emsp;&emsp;<span data-tippy="Thou’ll" class="green">Thou will</span> remember me?

2

Permit thy memory a trace  
&emsp;Of my true love to wear;  
Nor let new scenes the thought efface,  
&emsp;That hence my peace you bear.  
In mind I still shall follow thee —   
&emsp;From thee I’ll be never —   
&emsp;Yet ah! who knows if ever  
&emsp;&emsp;<span data-tippy="Thou’lt" class="green">Thou will</span> remember me!

3

With lonely step in joyless land  
&emsp;I sadly now shall rove,  
And from the woods and rocks demand  
&emsp;Where moves the maid I love:  
Still shall I sigh and call on thee,  
&emsp;Forget thee shall I never;  
&emsp;And thou — who knows if ever  
&emsp;&emsp;<span data-tippy="Thou’lt" class="green">Thou will</span> remember me?

4

Then shall I hasten once agen,  
&emsp;Each much lov’d spot to see  
Where once I happy liv’d — for then,  
&emsp;Dear Maid! I liv’d with thee.  
Yet here shall busy memory  
&emsp;Peace from my poor heart sever,  
&emsp;For who can tell if ever  
&emsp;&emsp;<span data-tippy="Thou’lt" class="green">Thou will</span> remember me?

5

Once near that spring, fir’d by disdain,  
&emsp;I durst thy pow’r defy:  
And there, thy smiles restor’d again,  
&emsp;New rais’d the suppliant sigh;  
Here liv’d on hope once-happy me;  
&emsp;There, hope and I did sever:  
&emsp;Alas! who knows if ever  
&emsp;&emsp;<span data-tippy="Thou’lt" class="green">Thou will</span> remember me!

6

And when thou glad’st another land,  
&emsp;Far distant many a mile,  
Of suitors what a num’rous band,  
&emsp;Shall strive to win thy smile!  
’Mid tender plaints and jocund glee  
&emsp;Ceasing to court thee never,  
&emsp;Ah! who can tell if ever  
&emsp;&emsp;<span data-tippy="Thou’lt" class="green">Thou will</span> remember me!

7

Think then upon the pleasing pains  
&emsp;Thou’st wak’d within my breast;  
Think — hopeless long I wore thy chains  
&emsp;Ere by thy pity blest;  
Think on this parting sad, that me  
&emsp;From her I love doth sever;  
&emsp;Think... ah! who knows if ever  
&emsp;&emsp;<span data-tippy="Thou’lt" class="green">Thou will</span> remember me!
