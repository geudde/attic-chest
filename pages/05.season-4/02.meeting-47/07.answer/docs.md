<span class="title">From her ever faithful Moth</span>

Vapours and clouds may sometimes rise  
In fleecy squadrons to the skies,  
And hide from our weak mortal eyes  
&emsp;Each planet bright —   
And in some inauspicious hour  
Tho’ passing clouds may seem to lour,  
The Polar Star retains her power  
&emsp;Unseen her light.

No “newer star” Moth hovers round,  
No newer star will e’er be found,  
To which by sweet attraction bound  
&emsp;She’ll love to flee —   
For Stella, thou’rt her wishes goal  
In absence, they Phaloena’s soul  
True as the needle to the Pole,  
&emsp;Still turns to thee.
