Once Stella to her Moth was dear,  
&emsp;And Moth then promised to be true,  
And Stella thought her Moth sincere,  
&emsp;But ah, the truth too soon she knew.  

Moth said to this, *her* Polar Star,  
&emsp;She’d frequent guide her evening flight,  
Borne on her emerald pinions far  
&emsp;To hover around her friendly light.  

And Stella said that she would prove  
&emsp;Still faithful to her airy sprite  
Like the bright Pole Star, cease to move,  
&emsp;And shine with ever-steady light.  

But like her kindred race, that borne  
&emsp;On waving plumes, thro’ Flora’s bower  
Sip all the nectared dews of morn,  
&emsp;From every lovely, fragrant flower

Thus Stella’s Moth is faithless found  
&emsp;Forgets her wonted course to steer,  
Some newer star she hovers round,  
&emsp;And vows, as erst, to be sincere.  

And many a tedious, lonely night  
&emsp;Has faithful Stella lately passed,  
In watching for her roving sprite  
&emsp;Long looked for, nor beheld at last.
