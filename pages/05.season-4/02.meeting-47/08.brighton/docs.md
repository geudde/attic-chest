<div class="author">Miss Vardill</div>

From Brighton to London, Queen Venus drove up  
With Phoebus and Mars at the Regent’s to sup;  
But when on the toilet her cestus was laid,  
No Graces were ready to offer their aid!  

Surpris’d & resentful the Goddess look’d round —   
“What! do I keep three, & not one can be found?  
If three lady’s-maids are sufficient no more,  
I’ll send to a register-office for *four*.”

“This moment I’ll fly there,” said Mars, “To oblige you  
But pray learn to call it the *Therapolegia!*  
In compounds of Latin my boot-brushers speak,  
And glorify black-balls in Hebrew or Greek!”

“Now put on your pelerine, Venus, ’tis late;  
Your pigeons are harness’d, the constables wait —”   
“The constables!” — ”Yes, all our parties require them;  
And Cupid himself has determin’d to hire them!”

“Well! where are the Graces?” — “at Tilney’s, no doubt,  
To wait on the heiress, and patterns cut out:  
They’re not at the play or the op’ra, ’tis clear,  
They have not been seen there for more than a year.”

Said Phoebus, “Let me as their advocate plead;  
The Graces this season are learning to read:  
Grown tir’d of Hympus and old-fashion’d play-things  
They go to draw lots in — a *casket from Athens!*”

“But if the fair handmaids seem heedless and vain,  
And Venus another would add to her train,  
Next Wednesday night, or whenever she chooses,  
She’ll find a new Grace in the Meeting of Muses!”
