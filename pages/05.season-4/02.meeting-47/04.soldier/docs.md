How sweet the tired soldier’s rest  
Whose bosom owns no cruel guest  
That with a secret cankering power  
Blights in the bud each promised flower!

Be mine, the awful watch to keep,  
While my brave comrades, sunk in sleep  
See visions of their distant friends,  
And fancy all her magic lends  
To bring before the mental sight  
Whate’er their waking thoughts delight.  
Some valiant spirits dream of war  
And of the laurels they will share!  

To me, nor laurels, nor the cry,  
Of thousands shouting victory  
Could on my breaking heart bestow  
One faint, one transitory glow!  
It is not fame that calls me forth  
That gives this vapour courage birth  
’Tis peace, eternal peace, I crave  
And seek it in the soldier’s grave!
