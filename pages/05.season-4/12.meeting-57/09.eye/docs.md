Blest be the eye which brightest shines  
When pleasure leads her sportive train!  
Blest be the gentle hand which twines  
A myrtle leaf for FRIENDSHIP’s fame!  
&emsp;That eye shall light Apollo’s fire,  
&emsp;That hand directs his softest lyre.  

Yet, ELLEN, let not lavish praise  
Too fondly deck a sister’s shrine;  
Thy sister-minstrel’s votive lays  
Are but the semblances of thine:  
&emsp;For FRIENDSHIP’s brightness, like the morn’s,  
&emsp;Creates the beauty it adorns.  

As often thro’ refracting glass  
The sun bestows diminish’d light,  
Thro’ mine thy fair ideas pass  
And sparkle, tho’ less richly bright;  
&emsp;Thus in my fancy’s mimic stream  
&emsp;Thy wit beholds its soften’d beam.

Long may the hour to FRIENDSHIP dear  
Thy wit’s ethereal beam employ!  
May ev’ry hour when thou art near  
Awake to life another joy!  
&emsp;Thy social heart itself shall prove  
&emsp;The birth-place of Content and Love!
