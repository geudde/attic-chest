Fair daughter of the lovely May  
Thrice welcome on thy pinions gay!  
Thou look’st among the leaf’d trees  
A blossom sporting on the breeze  
Then welcome little flutt’ring sprite  
Thou fill’st my bosom with delight!

When thou leav’st thy silken cell  
Amid the garden’s sweets to dwell,  
Or seek’st the hawthorn in the grove,  
’Tis thou that wak’st the soul to love!  
Then welcome little flutt’ring sprite  
Thou fill’st my bosom with delight!

At thy approach sweet child of spring  
Swift fancy instant takes the wing  
And leads me to her fairy bowers  
Where ever bloom the fairest flowers!  
Then welcome, welcome, pretty sprite  
Thou fill’st my bosom with delight!

Sometimes o’er meads I take my flight  
And sometimes scale the mountain’s height,  
Or sporting on the dark green main  
Seem one of Amphitrite’s train.  
And still ’tis thou fair flutt’ring sprite  
That fill’st my bosom with delight!

While o’er each dell thy light wings plying  
While in each flow’rets cup thou’rt prying  
Each motion doth my fancy move  
To think thee Psyche seeking Love:  
Be what thou wilt, sweet fairy sprite,  
Thou fill’st my bosom with delight!
