<div class="author">Miss Porden</div>

Amid this festive scene so gay  
Why heave I thus unbidden sighs?  
Why turn from every nymph away?  
Yet cast around my anxious eyes?

What do I seek? A gayer scene,  
Has fancy’s magic e’er displayed?  
More melting strains the heart to win?  
Or nymph in brighter charms arrayed?

Why burst again the unbidden sigh?  
Yes! there is one, more lovely far,  
’Tis her I seek with anxious eye  
Her brilliant as the morning star.

But her alas I seek in vain —   
My bosom disappointment sours  
Has left me but the thorn of pain  
And crushed of love the opening flowers.
