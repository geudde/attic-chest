Ah! let me seek the sylvan shade  
Where many a village youth and maid  
While Phoebus stoops to gild the scene  
Are met upon the shadowy green  
Where jocund Sport with rosy cheeks  
Delights to show his games once freaks  
And sprightly Dance, in airy round  
Trips o’er the daisy dappled ground  
Where Mirth and Innocence unite  
To form the simple swain’s delight.  

Or slow and pensive let me rove  
Where Night’s sweet chantress lulls the grove  
Where Meditation loves to roam  
And view with mental eye her heavenly home!  
There oft beside the drowsy rill  
Or down the gently sloping hill  
With roses fringed and wild flowers dressed  
The amorous youth unlocks his breast  
And pleads a passion void of art  
That melts the listening virgin’s heart!
