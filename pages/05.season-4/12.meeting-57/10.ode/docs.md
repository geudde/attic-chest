Spirit of song, descend!  
&emsp;Wit, genius, fancy, leave your airy height!  
&emsp;Suspend awhile your flight,  
And o’er the Attic Chest together bend!  
&emsp;For hence your visions bright,  
Your strains as soft as dying gales,  
Your quips, and cranks, and mirth-fraught tales,  
&emsp;Are drawn each due-returning night;  
And here your votaries pleas’d repair,  
Your joys and converse sweet to share.

Ev’ry care full sweetly slumbers,  
Here, by force of magic numbers,  
&emsp;Lull’d to rest;  
Here mirth and lore, in pastime blent,  
Form pleasures useful, innocent:  
&emsp;The youthful breast  
Smit with the love of song, yet fearing  
&emsp;What it dictates to the lyre  
May prove a strain not worth the hearing,  
&emsp;Void of feeling, taste, or fire,  
&emsp;Here tries secure sits doubted pow'rs;  
&emsp;For here no brow of critic low'rs,  
&emsp;But by impartial friends the meed  
&emsp;Of praise or silence is decreed;  
&emsp;And, if no plaudit greet the strain,  
The bard successless may unknown remain.

Descend, immortal truth!  
&emsp;And candour, white-robed guest!  
&emsp;In varying colours drest  
Sweet modesty, peculiar grace of youth!  
&emsp;And curiosity, with sharpen’d eye  
&emsp;Each secret to espy,  
And flush’d surprise, and gratulation bland!  
For now discovery waves her mystic wand;  
&emsp;And secrecy retires to midnight shades —   
&emsp;&emsp;Naught shall be left her here to brood upon.  
Now expectation rules the Attic Band,  
And to avow their own effusions stand  
&emsp;All who have wander’d in Pierian glades,  
&emsp;&emsp;Or filled their little urn from Helicon.  
No more to unknown bards we lift the loud acclaim,  
Each now shall stand confest, and “each receive his fame.”

&emsp;Descend, propitious pow’rs!  
&emsp;&emsp;Our festival preside!  
&emsp;Your choicest gifts be ours!  
&emsp;&emsp;And still may joy betide  
&emsp;All those to whom these classic bow’rs  
&emsp;&emsp;Have pleasure’s purest draught supplied!  
&emsp;But first and chief our honor’d host,  
&emsp;And who his name and lineage boast;  
&emsp;May bounteous Heav’n, his race caressing,  
&emsp;Upon them pour each choicest blessing,  
&emsp;And grant them, free from care or pain,  
&emsp;Their friends next year to meet again!  
Wit, genius, fancy, pow’r of potent song!  
&emsp;All that exalts the soul  
&emsp;&emsp;And heaven’y strains inspires!  
&emsp;&emsp;Still fan the poet’s fires —   
&emsp;Your inspiration roll —   
And with us still your cheering stay prolong!  
&emsp;So shall our summer pass in pleasure,  
&emsp;So shall its beauties live in dulcet measure,  
So shall the Attic Chest be rich in future treasure.
