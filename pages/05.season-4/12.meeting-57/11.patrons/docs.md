Adieu my patrons kind, adieu,  
&emsp;Till winter shall her reign resume  
Tho’ no bright tints her vestments shew,  
&emsp;And cheerless is her leafless gloom.  
Oh how I prize her sombre hue  
&emsp;Above the summer’s lavish bloom,  
Her gloom is cheered by wit’s bright eye,  
And friendship’s flowers her wants apply.

In vain may richest tints adorn  
&emsp;The rose in summer beauty drest,  
Each rose to me is but a thorn  
&emsp;That rankles in my wounded breast.  
In vain “the breezy call” of morn,  
&emsp;May joyful rouse you from your rest  
It wakes not me, supine I lie,  
Or waken, but to breathe a sigh.  

In vain the “incense breathing” gale  
&emsp;May all Arabia’s sweets dispense,  
No sweets to me its wings exhale  
&emsp;But sicken my revolting sense.  
E’en autumn’s fruits nectarious fail  
&emsp;To give me joy, I bid them hence,  
And all the songsters of the grove,  
In my sad heart no pleasure move.  

But when the winter’s driving rain,  
&emsp;Bids all from woodland scenes retire  
Oh then I breathe, I wake again,  
&emsp;I seize anew my idle lyre  
And pour in many a varied strain  
&emsp;Song that Apollo might inspire,  
I joy the wintry blast to hear,  
The storm is music to my ear.

Then listening to my songs of joy  
&emsp;Gay youths and blooming damsels move  
New light I lend the sparkling eye  
&emsp;And fan the trembling flame of love.  
I rule the hour, bid sorrow fly,  
&emsp;And every heart new pleasure prove  
And mirth directs without control  
The social banquet of the soul.  

So have I reign’d, and hope has said  
&emsp;That so once more your Chest shall reign  
The care of every Attic maid,  
&emsp;The joy of every Attic swain.  
Yet with unwonted fear I dread  
&emsp;Lest time should make her promise vain  
The opening buds of hope should tear  
And leave the canker of despair.  

On you I call, whose tuneful lyres  
&emsp;Have raised me to my present fame  
Have often fanned my fading fires  
&emsp;And fed my bold aspiring flame  
On you whilst loveliest hope inspires  
&emsp;Still undismayed I rest my claim  
From sad oblivion and neglect  
Your long loved casket to protect.  

If e’er in you my tuneful spell  
&emsp;Waked pleasure’s smile or pity’s sigh  
If e’er fond memory loved to dwell  
&emsp;On guiltless scenes of Attic joy  
When the glad heart rang sorrow’s knell  
&emsp;And sparkled every brilliant eye,  
By them I call, Oh! once again  
Revive my *Antient Splendid* reign.
