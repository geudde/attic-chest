##### A Song to the Tune of The Hounds are all out, &c.

1

Of your *Chloes* and *Philises* poets may prate,  
I sing my plain Country *Joan*,  
Now twelve years my wife, still the joy of my life  
Blest day that I made her my own.  

&emsp;&emsp;My dear friends &c.

2

Not a word of her face, her shape, or her eyes,  
Of flames or of darts shall you hear,  
Tho’ I beauty admire, ’tis virtue I prize  
Which fades not in seventy year,  

&emsp;&emsp;My dear friends &c.

3

In peace and good order my household she guides,  
Right careful to save what I gain,  
Yet cheerfully spends, and smiles on the friends  
I’ve the pleasure for to entertain.  

&emsp;&emsp;My dear friends &c.

4

In health a companion, delightful and dear,  
Still easy engaging and free,  
In sickness no less, than the faithfullest nurse,  
As tender as tender can be.  

&emsp;&emsp;My dear friends &c.

5

She defends my good name, even where I’m to blame,  
Friend firmer to man ne’er was given;  
Her compassionate breast feels for all the distressed,  
Which draws down the blessings of Heaven.  

&emsp;&emsp;My dear friends &c.

6

Am I laden with care, she takes off a large share,  
That the burthen ne’er makes me to reel,  
Does good fortune arrive, the joy of my wife,  
Quite doubles the pleasure I feel.  

&emsp;&emsp;My dear friends &c.

7  

In rapture the giddy rake talks of his Fair,  
Possession shall make him despise;  
I speak my cool sense, which long exper’ence  
And acquaintance have chang’d in no wife.  

&emsp;&emsp;My dear friends &c.

8

No jealousy ever disturbs her calm breast,  
Convinc’d that I always respect her,  
So like doves we go fondly to rest,  
Without have one Curtain Lecture.  

&emsp;&emsp;My dear friends &c.

9

Were the fairest young princess, with millions in purse,  
To be had in exchange for my *Joan*,  
She could not be a better wife, might be a worse,  
So I’ll stick to my *Juggy* alone.  

&emsp;&emsp;My dear friends &c.  

I’ll cling to my lovely *Old Joan*.

10

Some faults we have all, and so may my Joan,  
But then they’re exceedingly small,  
And now I am us’d to ’em they’re so like my own,  
I scarcely can see them at all.  

&emsp;&emsp;My dear friends &c.  

I scarcely can see them at all.
