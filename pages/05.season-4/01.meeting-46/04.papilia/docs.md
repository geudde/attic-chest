<div class="author">Miss Porden</div>

My lyre anew you big me string  
&emsp;You bid me wake its sweetest strain,  
Of many a pleasing theme to sing,  
&emsp;But ah dear maid, you bid in vain.  

The winter’s cold has chilled my fire,  
&emsp;The winter’s fogs my senses numb,  
My hands refuse to sweep the lyre,  
&emsp;That lyre’s most tuneful strings are dumb.  

Yet ope the Chest again,  
&emsp;And call its gentle votaries round,  
And long you shall not bid in vain  
&emsp;No long my lyre be silent found.  

The fire that warms the sacred Chest,  
&emsp;The fire of genius, bright and clear,  
That burns forever in its breast  
&emsp;Again my frozen sense shall cheer.  

My lyre, self waked, spontaneous ring  
&emsp;Like Eolus’ famed harp shall seem  
Nor need my hand to tune its string,  
&emsp;But sport thro’ many a varied theme.

Chrysalis
