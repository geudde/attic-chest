<span class="title">The Worthy Guardian of the Wars</span>

The issue of the Attic trial,  
My client gained — nay, no denial!  
Let it therefore remembered be  
That on this day December three  
Notice by me to you was given  
To send your client back to heaven  
And leave the care of this Society  
To Hermes, famous for sobriety  
Who never tastes good wine or liquor  
In bottles stowed by wife of vicar  
But sips the pure Pierian fountain  
That springs from yon Parnassian mountain.  
Counsel when th’ Attic Meeting gather  
In the warm court in frosty weather  
Will move said meeting to declare  
Hermes the tenant of the chair  
Of this poetic learned Soci-  
ety of wits — his ’Torny I.
