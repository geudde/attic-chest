<div class="author">Miss Porden</div>

Let other love the vernal year,  
&emsp;When brighter verdure decks the grove,  
When early flowers the prospect cheer  
&emsp;The season sweet of hope and love  
Let others sing of summer’s reign  
&emsp;When clustering fruits the branches bend  
Or autumn’s stores that gild the plain  
&emsp;When groves a yellower umbrage lend.  
Yet winter still to me is dear,  
The sweetest season of the year.  

Though cold the northern gale may blow  
&emsp;And ceaseless fall the driving rain  
The leafless trees be topped with snow,  
&emsp;Or raging rivers flood the plain  
Tho’ silent are the feathered choir  
&emsp;And others at the change may mourn  
I’ll string anew my idle lyre  
&emsp;And hail bleak winter thy return  
For winter still to me is dear,  
The sweetest season of the year.

For then around the Attic Chest,  
&emsp;Its friends again assembled move,  
And in the tuneful band confessed,  
&emsp;Appears the beauteous maid I love  
And when her smiles, her speaking eye,  
&emsp;Her wanderer welcome home again  
Scarce can my breast conceal its joy  
&emsp;And scarce its ardent love restrain.  
Oh winter then to me is dear,  
The sweetest season of the year.

When I her strains enraptured hear  
&emsp;And all admire <span data-tippy="my" class="green">her</span> sprightly lays  
And scarce my faltering tongue can dare  
&emsp;To pay her tribute meet of praise  
Or when with her the dance I lead  
&emsp;Her graceful form enraptured view,  
Her sprightly mien, her airy tread,  
&emsp;Her steps to art and nature true  
Oh winter then to me is dear,  
The sweetest season of the year.
