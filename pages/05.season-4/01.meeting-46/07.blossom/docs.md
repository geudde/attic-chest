The fairest blossom of the north,  
&emsp;Returns by Thames’ gay side to bloom,  
With liveliest hues and fragrant worth,  
&emsp;To cheer the winter’s leafless gloom.  

May no dread storms in darkness lour  
&emsp;To bend the earth its tender head  
No tempests crush so sweet a flower  
&emsp;Or rudely tear it from its bed.  

Tho’ veiled in clouds the lord of day  
&emsp;Refuse to gild the barren land,  
Yet friendship’s mild benignant ray  
&emsp;Shall bid the beauteous bud expand.  

While love his genial warmth shall shed  
&emsp;Fill with new life its tender form,  
And some tall oak shall screen its head,  
&emsp;From sad misfortune’s chilling storm.

Yet no! that tender flower disdains  
&emsp;The oaks protecting care to prove,  
And cold and cheerless still remains  
&emsp;And shuns the genial warmth of love.  

Yet still the willow by its side  
&emsp;Shall weep in silence its neglect,  
And should the wintery storms arise  
&emsp;Shall screen it from their dire effect.  

And if one smile of fragrance pay  
&emsp;Its tender zeal, its constant care,  
Shall joyful bless the happy day,  
&emsp;It screened from ill a flower so fair.
