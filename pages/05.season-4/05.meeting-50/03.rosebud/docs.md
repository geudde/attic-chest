I mark’d the bright and fervid ray  
&emsp;The vernal bud enclose  
Winter’s sunshine flatt’ring day  
&emsp;Nurse th’ embryo rose.  

Cheer’d with genial warmth it grew  
&emsp;The garden’s early pride  
And near to where exotics blew  
&emsp;Would to the wall confide.  

The tender charms protection claim  
&emsp;And I had hop’d to see  
Maturity the rose attain  
&emsp;That grac’d my fav’rite tree.  

Deceitful presage of the spring  
&emsp;That call’d its beauty forth!  
The beam implanted winter’s sting  
&emsp;The canker of the north.  

I saw it sicken when the gale  
&emsp;The petals rudely blew  
I saw it droop beneath the hail  
&emsp;Where late it kindly grew.  

Musing I mourn’d its early fate  
&emsp;And moraliz’d the theme  
Transient the joy our wishes greet  
&emsp;Our peace a summer’s gleam.

So bloom our hopes on life’s bleak plain
&emsp;We court tomorrow’s spring;  
The season oft of grief and pain  
&emsp;That disappointments bring.  

Yet cheated by the partial ray  
&emsp;We bliss uncertain prize  
Forget that virtue’s brightest day  
&emsp;To hope beyond the skies.
