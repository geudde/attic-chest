##### To Amanda

When Attic Wit & Mirth preside  
Amanda! why with scornful pride  
My humble lay reprove?  
&emsp;The sparkling verse which smoothly flows  
The sand of shallow Fancy shows,  
&emsp;But not the pearl of love!  

Thy beaming eye I never praise,  
Nor on thy lips vermillion gaze  
&emsp;In soft, but fatal danger!  
’Tis not thy silver voice I bless,  
For he who would his wit possess  
&emsp;Must be to thine a stranger!  

But ’tis thy *Frown* whose bland control  
Oft to my tempest-troubled soul  
&emsp;Has peace & safety given:  
Then if thy frown from fatal flames  
So soon the erring soul reclaims  
&emsp;*Smile* next, & grant it heaven!  

Yes, smile, Amanda! claim thy pow’r —   
In reconcilement’s precious hour  
&emsp;The heav’n of pease is known;  
When spleen has sunk, & pride has bow’d,  
And joy beams thro’ the parting cloud,  
&emsp;Love builds his surest throne.

The flow’r which round the ice-plant clings,  
The bird which from its ashes springs  
&emsp;Is priz’d beyond compare;  
And love that braves thy anger’s gloom  
Is lasting as the ice-plant’s bloom,  
&emsp;And as the phoenix rare.  

While pride & scorn their revel keep,  
Love in his humble shroud may sleep,  
&emsp;But never, never dies!  
He rests in death-like silence hid  
Till Mercy’s angel-voice shall bid  
&emsp;His guiltless spirit rise.  

Amanda! thus thy beaming eye  
To hopes which cold & buried lie  
&emsp;Might resurrection give:  
But since an angel’s voice can save  
Love’s spirit from its timeless grave,  
&emsp;Speak, too, & bid it live!
