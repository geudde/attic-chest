Miss Thomson

From a newly married man, to his friend a learned and determined bachelor

Love rules the court, the camp, the ground,  
And men below, and heav’n above,  
For love is heav’n, and heav’n is love”

Lay of the Last Minstrel

Hoot! hoot! that ye, a strappon chiel,  
Should gang aboot wi’ hairt o’ steel,  
&emsp;Sae crouse and clever:  
Nay, never glow’r in wild amaze  
If ye nae sing in woman’s praise  
&emsp;Ye’re lost for ever!

To Coventry I fain wad sin ye  
To sigh an greet till dool should min ye  
&emsp;For tankin treason:  
Ha! are ye sire an unco’ Turk  
That in yor hairt ane doubt can lurk  
&emsp;O’ woman’s reason?

In my ain Kathi’s twa blue eyes  
And bonnie mou’ mair logic lies,  
&emsp;Than maist heads carry:  
List to her cannie word a wee  
An’ then hop, step, an’ loup like me,  
&emsp;At ane ye’ll marry.  
Veil, veil yir bonnet, so her grace  
My sooth! ye ken t’is na disgrace  
&emsp;Fit bin to beauty:  
Fit screen the sax frae silk wae,  
Has aye been deem’d syne Adam’s day  
&emsp;Man’s bounden duty.

Aibhris a Scottish wife may suit us  
Better than Portia wife of Brutus  
&emsp;Yet a maist own:  
That maingst thae men her a’ admire  
There’s unco few wad swallow fire,  
&emsp;Without a poan.

An ana wife o’ bra’ Ceanna  
’Gainst Roman Claudius deem’d a sinner,  
&emsp;Sae douce an’ faithfu’:  
Wha struck the glance until her hairt,  
And cried, “My poetus tis thy smart,  
&emsp;Not *mine* that’s painfu’”

Then laud my frien’, thy chish-ma-claiver,  
Maingst learned schemes na longer waver  
&emsp;Burn, burn thy beuks:  
Tak’ a gude wife, an’ read na’ mair,  
Save in her eyes, there’s unco hair  
&emsp;In woman’s leuks

Then sing for aye in woman’s praise  
Quick woo yir Jo in dossel lays  
&emsp;The kirk’s before ye:  
Whiles I adore my better pairt  
For it! her faithfu’ feeling hairt,  
&emsp;Is a’ my glory.
