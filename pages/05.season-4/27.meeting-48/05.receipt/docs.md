Sir

I’ve received from you the glittering trash  
Known to mere mortals by the name of cash  
Four heads in argent newly from the Mint,  
Each worth three shillings, or the deuce is in’t  
For in the circle of the civic crown  
Is the fair legend place, to make it known.  
Potosi’s gnomes bestow’d the shining ore  
Which busy kelpies brought to Albion’s shore,  
Swift flew the vessel o’er the dangerous seas  
While convoy sylphs were floating on the breeze.  
Old Vulcan and the Salamandrine race  
Then gave the metal all its sterling grace,  
To me it came by friendly fairy’s hands  
And *here’s* receipt in full of all demands.

M.F.
