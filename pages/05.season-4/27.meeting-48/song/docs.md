Yes! once I met her downcast eyes  
Where modesty in triumph reigned  
Meeting with half concealed disguise  
The looks of love she scarcely feigned.  

And once I heard her soothing voice  
Th’ tones so musically mild;  
Breathed with soft undulating noise  
Like floating air, so soft, so wild.  

Thus I in love’s fell snare was caught  
Its poison to my bosom stole;  
And I’ve been this fond lesson taught  
That love’s the heaven of the soul.
