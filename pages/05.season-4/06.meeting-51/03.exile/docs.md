Sweet dream, to my pillow return!  
&emsp;The heart-weary wanderer cheer  
Redeem from the mouldering urn  
&emsp;The treasures of memory dear!  
Methought I trod light on the bank  
&emsp;Where bloom’d my lov’d eglantine’s flow’r,  
And sought ’midst the mistletoe dank  
&emsp;The roof of my lost Lucy’s bow’r.  

The moon on her long lov’d abode  
&emsp;Shone bright as in midsummer’s eve  
While I sprang thro’ the far winding road  
&emsp;The kisses of peace to receive.  
Joy lighted the white-column’d hall,  
&emsp;Love smil’d on the steps of the door;  
Then revelry woke at the call  
&emsp;Of them, who shall waken no more!

The woodbine hung gay round the thatch  
&emsp;Now sunk with the wrecks of the wave;  
And I saw on the half-open’d latch  
&emsp;The hand which is dust in the grave!  
The corn-reapers sung on the hill  
&emsp;Where now the wild wood pigeon cries;  
How blithe seem’d the hum of the mill  
&emsp;Where lonely the winter-wind sighs!

Blest land! shall I view thee no more?  
&emsp;Shall my feet never press thee again?  
But fancy thy charms shall restore —   
&emsp;For me they unfaded remain!  
Thy dome may be silent and cold,  
&emsp;Yet memory claims it her own:  
The ruin I cannot behold  
&emsp;To me shall be ever unknown.  

The axe of the stranger has laid  
&emsp;My bow’r of lov’d eglantines low;  
But memory visits their shade —   
&emsp;Still, still in her Eden they grow!
My groves may be leafless and shorn  
&emsp;Yet fancy still pictures their prime;  
She hears not my foresters mourn,  
&emsp;She sees not the footsteps of time.

The faces I loved in their bloom  
&emsp;All faded and furrow’d may be;  
The hearts may lie cold in the tomb  
&emsp;Which bounded in gladness with me.  
But I shall not their relics survey,  
&emsp;Nor tread the green turf where they sleep,  
Nor see round their mouldering clay  
&emsp;The moss of the sepulchre creep!  

No, still let me fancy them near  
&emsp;While thro’ the dim valley I roam,  
Their voices at midnight I hear  
&emsp;They call the poor wanderer home!
My friends! ye assemble there still  
&emsp;The home of a *Father* ye share!  
My path may be dreary and chill  
&emsp;But soon ye shall welcome me there!
