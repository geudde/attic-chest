##### Addressed to a Brother

In return for the magical ring,  
Which to me so kindly you proffer,  
In numbers most grateful I’ll sing,  
The best that my genius can offer.

Oh! may it a talisman prove  
A spell to keep flatt’rs away;  
Be a token of brotherly love,  
Which I trust in, will never decay.

Should misfortune unthought of pursue  
And health once again take its wing,  
I will trust in good wishes for you  
And the charms of the magical ring.
