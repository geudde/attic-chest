Not to festive dance or song  
Music, all thy charms belong!  
Rather let thy presence teach  
Harmony of thought and speech;  
While in lines of silver sound  
Fancy’s polish’d gems abound.  

Bid thy attic Ida speak  
Then thy softest sceptre seek!  
Teach the full and frequent pause,  
Give the melting cadence laws  
When her envied lips dispense  
Stores of truth and eloquence.

Oft in measures smoothly slow  
Bid her tuneful accents flow;  
Or in tones unfix’d and free  
Lend the light verse melody:  
Then let bolder numbers roll  
Lofty as the parent-soul.  

’Midst the sister-muses’ train  
Ever keep thy welcome reign!  
When their ample gifts combine  
Come, and softly mingle thine;  
Ida’s lip is Wisdom’s care  
Music! claim thy empire there!
