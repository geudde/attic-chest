They say that love had once a book,  
(The urchin likes to copy you,)  
Where all who came, the pencil took,  
And wrote, like us, a line or two.

’Twas Innocence, the maid divine,  
Who kept this volume bright and fair,  
And saw that no unhallow’d line,  
Or thought profane should enter there.

And sweetly did the pages fill  
With fond device and loving lore,  
And ev’ry leaf she turned was still  
More bright than that she turn’d before!

Beneath the touch of Hope, how soft  
How light the magic pencil ran!  
Till Fear would come, alas! as oft,  
And trembling close what Hope began.  

A tear or two had dropped from Grief  
And Jealousy would now and then  
Ruffle in haste some snowy leaf  
Which Love had still to smooth again!  

But oh! there was a blooming boy,  
Who often turned the pages o’er,  
And wrote therein such words of joy,  
As all who read still sigh’d for more!  

And Pleasure was this spirit’s name  
And tho’ so soft his voice and look,  
Yet Innocence whene’er he came  
Would tremble for the spotless book!  

For still she saw his playful fingers  
Filled with sweets and wanton toys  
And well she knew the stain that lingers  
After sweets from wanton boys!  

And so it chanced on luckless night  
He let his honey goblet fall  
O’er the dear book, so pure, so white,  
And sullied lines, and marge, and all.  

In vain he sought with eager lip,  
The honey from the leaf to drink,  
For still the more the boy would sip  
The deeper still the blot would sink!

Oh it would make you weep to see  
The traces of this honey flood  
Steal o’er a page where Modesty  
Had freshly drawn a rose’s bud.  

And Fancy’s emblems lost their glow  
And Hope’s sweet lines were all defaced  
And Love himself could scarcely know,  
What Love himself had lately traced!

At length the urchin Pleasure fled,  
(For how alas could Pleasure stay)  
And Love while many a tear he shed  
In blushes flung the book away!  

The index now alone remains  
Of all the pages spoil’d by Pleasure,  
And tho’ it bears some honey stains  
Yet Memory counts the leaf a treasure.  

And oft they say she scans it o’er,  
And oft by this memorial aided  
Brings back the pages now no more,  
And thinks of lines that long are faded.
