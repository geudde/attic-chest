<div class="author">Miss Sanders</div>

As each returning day I gaze on thee  
I strive to check the rising misery,  
&emsp;That feeling would impart,  
And as I view thy smiling features o’er,  
And sadly know for me they’ll smile no more  
&emsp;I almost break my heart.

Unconscious shade of one I’ve lov’d so well,  
To thee alone my griefs I ne’er can tell;  
&emsp;For thou can’st not betray,  
And if in *this* I can some pleasure find,  
I fancied joys can ease the wounded mind;  
&emsp;And gild the passing day.

Oh! then I’ll hold thee more than ever dear  
And cease to grieve nor call my fate severe,  
&emsp;Whilst thou thy influence lend,  
And tho’ remembrance may demand a sigh  
And tears may fall unbidden from my eye,  
&emsp;I’ll only call thee *friend!*
