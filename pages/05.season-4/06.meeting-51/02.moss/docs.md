> With some specimens address’d to Miss P.

These specimens from nature wild  
&emsp;I cull — to Ellen send,  
From Alpine heights, where winter mild  
&emsp;Recalls the absent friend.

With whom in rougher seasons past  
&emsp;I’ve shar’d the cheerful hour;  
Scenes in the mind of mem’ry cast,  
&emsp;That prove how great the pow’r.

Of poetry and friendship’s charm  
&emsp;Wit’s keen but baneful dart,  
That flies to please, but not to harm  
&emsp;The unsuspecting heart.  

My feelings simple present tell,  
&emsp;The mind’s fond pleasure o’er;  
On Attic eves it loves to dwell  
&emsp;Tho’ seen the Chest no more!

In vain thro’ winter’s gloom I seek  
&emsp;The varied posy’s hue,  
The crocus scarce attempts to peep  
&emsp;Thro’ misty rains and dew.

No vagrant flow’r the hills disclose  
&emsp;Or primrose cheers the vale,  
Winds have impair’d the fasten’d rose  
&emsp;Nor violets scent the gale.  

The dewdrops pale and tender frame  
&emsp;Could ill the pressure bear;  
Else had my packet borne its name  
&emsp;And sweets to Ellen dear.  

Yet moss more apt resemblance wears,  
&emsp;To friendship that’s sincere,  
For tried by storms it still appears  
&emsp;Unchang’d throughout the year.

Then with it, I’d each wish enclose  
&emsp;Affection could impart,  
Content with health’s unfading rose  
&emsp;And happiness of heart!

Then such the New Years wish I send,  
&emsp;Tho’ late conveyance came;  
Accept it Ellen from a friend  
&emsp;In distance still the same.
