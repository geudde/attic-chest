<div class="author">Miss Porden</div>

Nay start not when this well know hand you view  
&emsp;Nor when you see Lothario’s hated name,  
Ere you have read this sad, this last Adieu  
&emsp;Unpitying plunge it in devouring flame.  

For tho’ till Heaven this breast of life bereave,  
&emsp;Where’er I roam, to what far distant shore,  
My plaints must flow, my sighs of anguish heave  
&emsp;Lothario’s love shall vex thy peace no more.  

Ere thy beloved form had crossed my sight  
&emsp;Happy mid Ebor’s peaceful vales I dwelt  
My looks were joyful as my heart was light  
&emsp;And sorrow’s sting was short, and seldom felt.

The days passed on, how sweet how swift their flight,  
&emsp;Soft as the zephyr’s balmy breath they moved  
Until thou cam’st in heavenly beauty bright  
&emsp;I saw thee — needs it more to say I loved.

For who could see that eye of softest blue,  
&emsp;Reflect the thoughts that in thy bosom rise,  
As ocean’s placid surface gives to view  
&emsp;The countless stars that gem the vaulted skies.  

With Wit’s ethereal fire could see it glow  
&emsp;Could see it sparkle at the call of Joy  
Melt in soft sorrow at the tale of woe,  
&emsp;Then beam once more in cheerful ecstasy.  

And who could gaze upon that lovely face  
&emsp;Round which thy ringlets wave with careless art,  
Thy beauteous form attired in angle grace  
&emsp;Nor feel the subtle poison at his heart.  

And oh, how pleasing is affection’s spring  
&emsp;Ere watchful Reason wakes our cruel fears  
Ere Seraph Hope flies on expanded wing  
&emsp;And Love’s bright face is soiled with bitter tears.  

Each smile thy cheerful friendship gave to me,  
&emsp;Hope thought might from a kindred flame arise  
Could in each act a tenderer impulse see,  
&emsp;And read a softer meaning in my eyes.

Too soon these sweet illusions passed away  
&emsp;As melt the rainbow’s brilliant tints from sight  
Like these alas, as transient and as gay —   
&emsp;When to Augusta’s towers thou tookst thy flight.

Nor were the pangs of absence all I bore  
&emsp;For could I hope mid crowds of fortunes blest  
With With and Wealth and Virtue’s amplest store,  
&emsp;Lothario’s image still could please thy breast.  

Yet thou wert near me still — I still could view  
&emsp;Though with a sigh of agonizing pain  
At memory of thy charms which thrills anew  
&emsp;That beauteous form so long beloved in vain.  

Could listen to that voice, so soft so sweet  
&emsp;Till painful thought wrung forth the starting tear  
Till every pulse a wilder measure beat  
&emsp;A fatal pleasure, yet it still was dear.

But thou are fled once more, and when I see  
&emsp;In all the agony of wild despair,  
The scenes that Memory consecrates to thee  
&emsp;She wakes Reflections too severe to bear.

Hope can revive my sinking soul no more.  
&emsp;For thee sweet maid, I fly my native land  
To yield my breath on Lusitania’s shore  
&emsp;Or lose thy memory on her distant strand.  

And shouldst thou chance in Freedom’s sacred cause  
&emsp;My name enrolled in lists of death to see  
Oh say will sad remembrance bid tee pause  
&emsp;Will one blest drop of Pity fall for me.

Farewell forever — Oh may Heaven bestow  
&emsp;Its sweetest choicest blessings on thy head,  
May Truth and Virtue guide thee here below,  
&emsp;And happier worlds receive thy spirit fled.

Lothario
