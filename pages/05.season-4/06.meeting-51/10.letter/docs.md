The advertising lady presents her compliments to those gentlemen who have favoured her with answers. It was her full intention to have noticed them, but the agitation and suspense of mind in which she has been kept, as she is particularly susceptible of tender impressions, has had such an effect on her delicate frame, that she has been the prey of a slow consuming fever and is not sufficiently recovered to hold a pen. If indeed some speedy remedy is not applied she is apprehensive that the lover may have to perform the part of Orpheus, instead of the husband.

She had hoped to receive more answers and believes that would forward her recovery, especially as the gentleman she would prefer has not yet noticed her advertisement. The lady hopes that he will no longer be retrained by timidity, but give utterance to that sweet passion which his eyes though not his lips have so frequently declared. She is still agreeable as ever, though the roses on her cheeks have in some degree given place to the lily which at six & thirty is not uncommon and only serves to render *her* more interesting.
