Laird Malcolm has biggit a bonie bowre  
On yonder brae for Annie,  
And deckit wi’ monie a flowre  
To please his ain dear Annie.

The wa’s are a’ as white as milk  
Sae fair, the bowre of Annie,  
The ha’ is hung wi’ softest silk  
Sae gay, the bowre of Annie.

The windows are baith wide & lang  
To light the bowre of Annie,  
There the wee birdies sing their sang  
At ilka dawn to Annie.  

The woodbines round them creep & try  
To shade the winsome Annie,  
Lest Phoebus wi’ his gowden eye  
Shou’d dare to leuk on Annie.  

And a’ the garden’s like hersel  
Gay, sweet, and fair, like Annie,  
And ilk flowre some charm can tell  
Some blink o’ bonie Annie.

The lily on its slender stem  
Leuks like the gentle Annie  
Bedight wi’ mony a dewie gem  
Like tears o’ tender Annie.  

And roses on their thorny bush  
Bloom like the modest Annie,  
She’s a’ their sweetness & their blush,  
But not ae thorn has Annie.  

The curling tendrils of the vine  
Are like the locks of Annie,  
But what is like the bonie een  
The twa bright een of Annie!  

The cope of heav’n sae bright & clear  
Is like the een of Annie,  
Nae ither blue wi’ that can peer  
But the blue een of Annie.  

What man I liken to the smile  
The saft, kind, smile of Annie,  
Sae free frae care, sae pure frae guile  
Ah where’s the smile of Annie!

Her guardian angel while she sleeps  
Has watchfu’ care of Annie,  
Close by her pillow vigil keeps  
And smiles like lovely Annie!
