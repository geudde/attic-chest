Alas! what means this great, this sudden change,  
&emsp;In City pageants and in City dinners,  
An alteration sad as it is strange  
&emsp;To well fed knights and gormandizing sinners.  

Last year no feast announced the new Lord Mayor  
&emsp;And, now to atone for such a grievance past  
When each resolved to eat a double share,  
&emsp;We found alas! the expected feat aghast.  

What lack of turtle on the lengthened board,  
&emsp;How few the haunches, partridges and pheasants,  
Sure in two years the City might afford  
&emsp;One feast superior to a common peasants.  

Spirit of gormandizing! art thou fled,  
&emsp;From this blest Isle so long thy lovâ€™d retreat,  
Where thou so long in regal state hast fed,  
&emsp;On well fed turkeys and on good green fat.  

Oh come blest spirit! at our call return  
&emsp;Nor let sour temperance usurp thy reign,  
Nor let us common sense dull influence mourn,  
&emsp;Goddess of gluttony return again!

Phagophilus
